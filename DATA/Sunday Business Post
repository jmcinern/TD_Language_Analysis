Danny Rose shows courage off the field

Highlight: Southgate understands the mental strain of the game like few others

Head stuff stinks. There’s no prosthetic for a broken spirit. That’s what Danny Rose has gone through the last year and a half, like so many others in every walk of life. Rose isn’t in any old walk of life, he’s in the most high profile sport on the planet playing in a league where sympathy is hard to come by and coverage is often vicious.
Yet there he was talking to Miguel Delaney of the London Independent at England’s open media day about his struggles with mental health. His depression diagnosis that came early in an injury wracked 18 months. A man who earns the type of money most readers could only dream about was hurting and he felt the need to share.
Not just for himself, as a high profile athlete, he knows the help someone with his success can have, but for those hurting outside the limelight. His words about Gareth Southgate, the England manager, hit home in particular.
The somewhat unusual nature of the open day was that England decided to make the entire squad available for interview. No protections in place, a rare chance for journalists to properly meet the entire squad from the captain Harry Kane to the likely last man picked Rose.
Southgate was singled out by Rose for his assistance since his diagnosis. Rose went beyond platitudes to showing how the gaffer was there for him in person regularly to help. While untested on the field in terms of results, Southgate understands the mental strain of the game like few others. Even 22 years on, his penalty miss against Germany remains the first thing most associate with him.
Southgate is no therapist but the one thing he could give Rose was empathy and the Tottenham man embraced it. That’s the type of humanity sport too often puts to the side. With it he has seen wearing the England shirt as part of what makes him feel better about himself.
He told all to Delaney out of, per how the article reads, pretty much nowhere. Even his parents were unaware and the sheer amount of trauma he went through in the interim including losing his uncle and his mother being racially abused only made the challenges tougher.
Yet there he was, opening up and fully aware that his own honesty will have consequences. He’s already expecting racial abuse in Russia and is no doubt aware that some detritus in the stands both there and back in England will try to single him out for it. He knows the barbs, the jeers, and everything else is coming his way.
Still, Rose is there to face it all. He knows what he can do and how his story can help so many more, no matter the cost to him going forward. This corner doesn’t expect you to root for England in the World Cup, heck I’m cheering on Senegal, but you ought to root for Danny Rose.

Former ‘big house’ with colourful history on the block

Body


Middleton Park House, a Westmeath Georgian mansion with a colourful past is back on the market.
The 19th century house on 19 acres of parkland and gardens operated as a hotel and wedding venue until it ceased trading 18 months ago, and its contents were auctioned off by receiver Declan Taite last year.
It attracted national attention back in 1986 when professional gambler Barney Curley put the house and lands up as a prize in a raffle, an event that attracted television crews and throngs of media attention. The raffle was carried out by sports personality Micheal O’Hehir. Over 9,000 tickets were sold at IR£200 each and Curley reportedly made £1 million.
Over the years the house hosted celebrities including Rita Hayworth and her wealthy socialite husband Prince Ali Khan.
It was built in circa 1850 by the Anglo Irish military Boyd-Rochfort family who commissioned well known architect of the day George Papworth to design it and oversee its construction. It was in their ownership for 130 years until the early 1960s when it was sold.
It had many owners after that but eventually fell into disrepair. It was restored in 2007 by Gerard Lynam, who ran it as a wedding venue and country house hotel.
In 2014 it was acquired by what Savills described as “a UK based private equity firm” for in the region of its current sale price. It was stated that it intended to invest in its facilities and enhance it but it ran into trouble by 2016.
It’s being sold with a guide price of €675,000, estate agent Philip Guckian of Sherry Fitzgerald said.
“It needs work and the price reflects that,” said Guckian. There are several interested parties at above that price, he said.

Gender equality in Irish media

Highlight: Women are out quoted by men by a factor of three to one
Body


In a country where none of the editors of national newspapers are women, Irish media should be paying close attention to what Francesca Donner has to say.
Donner is director of the gender initiative at The New York Times, which was launched, by coincidence, around the same time that the newspaper broke the Harvey Weinstein story. The gender initiative focuses on closing the gender gap at the newspaper. It was set up to recognise gender as a lens through which we view the world; and aims to share the stories and opinions of a diverse range of women, lead the conversation around women’s and gender issues globally, and engage female readers of The New York Times.
Speaking at the Women in News summit during the World News Media Congress this week, Donner said that the gender initiative carefully looks at the voices shared by the New York Times, including everything from the sources used by journalists, the subjects they use, and whose stories journalists choose to tell, according to Journalism.co.uk.
It also examines the roles women and men included in stories play - are women more likely to be portrayed as victims, or are men quoted at length in stories where women only get a mention?
Donner said that women are out quoted by men by a factor of three to one. This can perpetuate the belief that men are experts, instead of women.
"Why do you keep quoting the same person in your stories? When you do, you get only one perspective," Donner said at the event.
So what can newspapers do to ensure that diverse voices are heard? Firstly, look at your team. Are they all mainly male, white, middle class and of similar mindsets? That is a problem. That leads to the homogenisation of voices. Think about that the next time you are hiring someone new, and also think about the barriers people from different backgrounds face when breaking into media and try to break them down.
Secondly, track data. Without data, no-one really knows how diverse the voices appearing on their newspaper or radio station or TV show is. Thirdly, get some new sources. While the old reliables are great because they are (the clue is in the name) reliable, at times when you are under less pressure put a little work into finding some new names - the effort will be worth it.

Businessman Emmet O’Neill has upped his shareholding in Lovin Media Group to 85 per cent after buying out a one-third stake in the company held by founder Niall Harbison.
Harbison is set to pocket about €1 million from the deal, which values Lovin Media at €3 million. Harbison began what was then Lovin Dublin in 2011 as website reviewing restaurants in Dublin. It has since expanded outside of Ireland with separate websites in Malta, Dubai, Manchester and Saudi Arabia and counts a number of major lifestyle brands as clients. Harbison is a well-known entrepreneur and previously set up marketing agency Simply Zesty, which was later sold to UTV for several million euro.
[caption id="attachment_418184" align="alignright" width="200"] Niall Harbison the founder of Lovin Media Group[/caption]
A statement from O’Neill’s Kouchin Holdings today said Harbison has now left the company. Former Ireland and Leinster rugby player Jamie Heaslip was an early investor in the business and owns about 9 per cent.
The company recently appointed radio executive Jamie Crawford as its chief executive and said that it is on track to record turnover of €3 million this year. The statement said Lovin Media has been profitable for the last two years and generates 10 million monthly page views.
“My mandate from Kouchin is to professionalise, commercialise, innovate and grow the business. Niall did an incredible job as founder and created a business with great potential. Kouchin have been very clear that they want to move on beyond the founder stage of the business, realise the potential of what we have and grow something of scale and value over the next five to ten years,” Crawford said in a statement.
O’Neill invested in Lovin Media a few years ago and has been involved with a number of companies, including Smiles Dental, which he sold for €36 million. He previously ran the forecourt operator Topaz.

Advisory body calls for “credible” economic plan

Length: 457 words

Highlight: The report noted the country still has one of the highest debt burdens in Europe
Body


The government has been issued with a stark warning by its council of economic advisers urging caution in October’s budget as the economy is potentially growing too fast and risks overheating.
The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC), in a report published this morning, said the economy has been growing faster than its potential since 2014 and this poses serious dangers if offsetting measures aren’t taken.
IFAC said much quicker increase in housing supply could derail the economy, and it also highlighted international issues including a hard Brexit, US trade policy and global tax changes as potential risks. It said Ireland’s tax base could be at a serious loss if multinational firms were to leave the country such is the reliance on corporation tax receipts.
The watchdog, though, is also concerned that the government is adding too much fuel to the fire by expanding the economy through spending increases rising at a much faster pace than overall economic growth. It said that at a minimum the forthcoming budget should not go any further than what had been outlined already.
“An appropriate policy for next year would be to increase government expenditure in line with the sustainable long-term growth rate of the economy,” the report said, noting that most forecasters estimate this figure to be about 3 per cent a year.
“This would imply an approximate limit for spending increases or tax cuts of up to €3.5 billion... as the starting point for any budgetary plans for 2019. Anything more expansionary than this suggested maximum limit is not likely to be appropriate. Yet improving the budget balance more than currently planned would be desirable, especially given the risks of overheating and the opportunity provided by favourable times.”
The report noted the country still has one of the highest debt burdens in Europe and there was a need to bring this figure down.
“Revenues arising from a faster-than-expected recovery in housing construction should be used to build buffers either through additional contributions to the Rainy Day Fund or through faster debt reduction. Moreover, spending should not be allowed to continue to drift up as unexpected – and likely cyclical or transitory – revenues arise,” IFAC said.
In some of its most harsh criticism, the body said there is a need for the government to develop a “credible” medium term economic plan. It said recent moves by the Department of Finance to set out a medium-term national debt target and the Rainy Day Fund “are only half-formed and need more development if they are to be effective”.
“The shortening of the horizon in the government’s most recent projections from five to three years ahead is not compatible with the aim of achieving medium-term fiscal stability.”

Apple has always had one edge on Google and Facebook, how it makes money. It sells comically expensive hardware to a devoted audience who will happily splurge like mad on the firm’s products. It doesn’t rely on ad sales or massive data accumulation, it goes straight to your wallet.That edge was crucial in enabling Apple to take a big step these past few days. 
Without saying it was going after Facebook and Google, it showed exactly how it was going to do it. Apple’s updated anti-tracking technology, ITP2, shuts a 24 hour window that benefited the two giants of the web world.ITP segregates cookies dropped by specific websites so they can only be tracked by that site. That basically meant that advertisers couldn’t track you from site to site. Previously that segregation only started after 24 hours, which was a huge out clause for the likes of Facebook and Google. Most users spent enough time at these or on the likes of YouTube that they would come back often enough for the segregation to never start.Not anymore.ITP2 kicks in that difference from the off. Once you’ve left you are gone and the trail runs cold. From an ad revenue perspective that’s grim for Facebook and Google as it limits their ability to build and evolve data profiles on Apple users.This is naturally great news for users on the privacy front as Apple is smartly recognising that prioritising privacy is good for sales.Unfortunately for Apple users, this won’t give you all the one thing you really want. It won’t give you the one thing everyone wants. Those supersized please click this thing warnings on the front of websites aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. You will still need to ok everything and scream into the abyss in the vain hope of something more tolerable.That’s the tightrope with treating privacy protection as a marketable feature. Users expect it to the point that it almost irks them. Apple is keeping its balance by essentially working within existing architecture.Shutting the window presents an opportunity to the tech giant to get a marketing win without having users even more annoyed at the layers upon layers of ‘OK’, ‘I accept’, and ‘All power to Cthulhu’ buttons they need to mash through to get to the content they want.Users that attach an economic value to privacy want the work done for them. That’s what ITP2 offers. It cuts the cord as soon as you leave a site, selling you calm without demanding your unyielding tolerance.In the process Apple has managed to create an issue for Google and Facebook. Following you around is sort of what they do. Apple users don’t represent the majority of those accessing the web but they are a sizeable and typically more affluent minority. ITP2 is kick right to the gut of how Facebook and Google gained from them.

What next for Local Property Tax?

Highlight: Donohoe wants the tax to be 'sustainable and affordable'  
Body


Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will have lots of tricky issues on his plate in the run up to the October Budget.
But it is safe to say that one of the issues he will be giving the most careful consideration to is property tax. https://www.businesspost.ie/politics/ff-property-tax-relief-proposal-smacked-418127 is just the start.
Donohoe was a member of the government that introduced the property tax back in 2013 and which then froze it in 2015, when the prospect of a steep rise in property tax payments beckoned.
The issue of when houses are revalued was put back from November 2016 to November 2019, so this is the Budget when Donohoe has to decide what to do.
He has been giving clear signals that he wants the tax to be 'sustainable and affordable'. In simple terms, this means that he is not going to raise the tax much or even at all. That's the affordable part. But he also has to come up with a new system that ensures that the property tax continues to bring in significant revenue for the exchequer of €500 million per year. That's the sustainable part. If that sum were to drop, then all the pressure would be on income tax and Vat and corporation tax - which are the very taxes that nosedive during a recession.
The expected solution is one that has been knocking about for three years now. Professor Don Thornhill had carried out a report for Donohoe's predecessor Michael Noonan about how the tax might be made fairer.
He recommended moving away from a single national rate of property tax – which is 0.18 per cent on the value of homes up to €1 million. Instead, it would be up to the government to decide how much property tax each of the 31 councils needed to run their operations at a minimum, and then the property tax percentage could be worked out at a local level.
How would that work? Take a householder in Dublin City Council whose home was valued at between €450,000 and €500,000 when the property tax came in back in 2013. Their annual property tax bill since then has been €855. But due to the rise in property prices, their house is now worth over €700,000. That means they are facing a higher property tax bill of €1,305 in 2020, when the next property tax revaluation takes place.
But the option Thornhill put out for Donohoe is to look at how much Dublin City Council needs to take in from the property tax to operate. Instead of charging the same 0.18 per cent rate as other councils, it could drop that percentage to say, 0.13 per cent for the person with the house now worth over €700,000. Their property tax bill might be around €900, which would be an increase on €855 but much more manageable than €1,305.44.
Dublin City Council would still be getting the €44 million it is due to take in this year from property tax.
I have chosen a householder in Dublin City Council in this blog not just because it is the council that raises the most every year from the property tax. It is also because the council covers Donohoe's Dublin Central constituency, where many householders are up in arms about how much property tax they pay compared to their country cousins.
During their recent June bank holiday breaks outside of the capital, they will have seen mansions four or five times the size of their own three-bed semi-Ds which attract much smaller property taxes. They do not want to hear about how their house prices reflect the better access to jobs, the Luas Cross City, colleges like DIT Grangegorman and national sports facilities. The simple view is "Why am I paying more property tax for a much smaller house?"
So this property tax review for the upcoming Budget is a very politically charged issue for Donohoe.
The Thornhill recommendation does provide him with a clear roadmap to solve his property tax problem. But there will still have to be a lot of tinkering to come up with a Budget Day announcement that is sustainable, affordable and politically acceptable.

A legal dispute over the ownership of waste company Panda was struck out late last week by agreement ending what promised to be a colourful dispute if had gone to full trial.
Neither Sretaw, the company behind Panda, nor the company it was embroiled in the legal dispute with, London-based investment company Craven House Capital, has explained why a decision was taken by both sides not to continue their actions.
A settlement is believed to have been agreed between the two parties but this could not be confirmed.
The London Stock Exchange listed company has issued no statement on Panda. It did not respond to requests for comment on the status of its court action.
Craven, which is chaired by the former governor of Bank of Ireland Richard Burrows, had been suing Panda because it alleged it had a deal to buy the business now called Panda Greenstar from its owner Eamon Waters.
Waters had denied any such arrangement and was taking his own counter action against Craven to a have a heads of agreement between his company and the investment firm set aside. A high profile Iraqi war contractor called Mike Battles who had acted as an adviser on the alleged deal had been due to feature in the case.
Battles worked for Desmond Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company that is asset manager to Craven, which is listed in London. Craven has a number of business interests including at one stage debt secured on the Green Isle hotel in West Dublin.
It recently acquired the entire share capital of IIU Inc, which sells global medical insurance products for international travellers, for $2.5 million in cash. The Company also announced that it had agreed the early repayment of a $2.5 million convertible loan made to Xenod Tour Oikod Epeix Afon Daktylidi AE, a Greek holding company whose sole asset is the Hotel Yiannakiny.

Smurfit undervalued by International Paper

Length: 338 words
Byline: Bloomberg Reporter
Highlight: The share price today is pricing in only a small chance of a deal
Body


There's still time for the impasse between packaging firm Smurfit Kappa and suitor International Paper to break — but investors are bracing for the three-month stand-off to end with no deal. Recriminations will fly, but Smurfit's resistance is defensible.
In late March, International Paper outlined a potential cash-and-stock offer worth €8.8 billion based on its then share price. It wanted the Irish company's agreement before making a formal bid and later ruled out making a hostile offer, hoping that the target's shareholders would pressure the board into negotiations.
The takeover proposal was pitched at a 29 per cent premium to where Smurfit was valued by the stock market before the talks, adjusting for a dividend that was about to be paid. That's hardly a knockout price. It valued the company at 10 times trailing Ebitda — again, an un-enticing number for a company of Smurfit's stature. DS Smith on Monday agreed to pay 12 times Ebitda for the much less established Europac.
The Irish firm's board was right to sit tight. The share price today is pricing in only a small chance of a deal, yet it's still at €33.08. It's not hard to believe that this stock could, in the near future, get past the €36.90 International Paper was dangling. Smurfit has a recent acquisition of its own under its belt that should help.
Sometimes the timing isn't right for M&A. There is some logic to a deal with International Paper, but the aspiring buyer just doesn't have the financial strength right now to be able to pay a full price. Even using a dollop of extra leverage, it was reliant on part-paying in its own stock, which reacted poorly to the idea of buying Smurfit. The shares have rallied recently only as expectations of a deal have faded.
Some Smurfit shareholders may scream that the board should have engaged. If they don't trust the directors to know the true value of the company, then they are welcome to call a meeting to oust them. But that judgment should be reserved until we see where the shares are this time in 2019.

Highlight: In 2011, Shane O’Farrell was killed by a driver with a string of previous convictions who shouldn’t have been at large that evening. Now his family are demanding answers from the state 
Body


Shane O’Farrell had just completed his studies in law and had submitted his Master’s thesis on August 2, 2011, the day his life was pointlessly cut short. It’s easy to see where he got the interest from. Almost seven years on, his mother Lucia holds up a large chart with a complex web detailing the many convictions of Žygimantas Gridziuška - the driver who knocked Shane off his bike in a hit-and-run as Shane was out training for a triathlon in Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan.
Each itemised conviction on the chart is connected to a file in a huge folder containing documents related to each court appearance. “This is nothing,” Lucia says, pointing at the five boxes of documents on her kitchen table.
It is the culmination of a body of research that began straight after Shane’s death, when the family started to look into the history of the driver who had mowed down their beloved relative. What they discovered was a man who was in and out of the courts frequently, who had consistently breached bail and who should not have been free that evening.
Last week, the Garda Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc) published its report into 56 allegations made by the O’Farrell family about the Garda handling of these cases. The report did not name any individual gardaí, and found there was “no conduct which may constitute an offence”. It did discover conduct which requires further investigation.
Shane’s family are unhappy with the report, and believe Gsoc does not provide adequate reasons for its findings. “It is scant, for six years of work,” Lucia says. She believes the decision to carry out further inquiries is an effort to further stall their search for justice.
She won’t stop until she gets a public inquiry into the case and, with the majority of Dáil TDs now supporting her call, it seems that is where it is headed.
On January 11, 2011, seven months before Shane was killed, Gridziuška appeared before Judge John O’Hagan in Monaghan District Court on five charges of theft and one of possession of stolen property - machinery from a factory that made speakers - relating to 2009 and 2010.
The judge adjourned the sentencing until the following year on the condition that if he was arrested for any offence under theft or fraud legislation he would be brought back to the court and sent to jail.
The 38-year-old continued to offend, but was never sent to jail. Just four months later, on May 9, 2011, he appeared before Ardee District Court on five charges of theft - all involving bottles of alcohol. He was sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for two years on the condition that he keep the peace and be on good behaviour.
The Gsoc report found that the judge in Ardee was not informed of the previous adjourned sentence in Monaghan.
It said no effort was made by gardaí to re-enter the case before Judge O’Hagan, even though it was a breach of bail. “If he had, he would have been put in jail,” said Fianna Fail’s justice spokesperson Jim O’Callaghan.
On June 8, 2011, Gridziuška appeared before Carrickmacross District court on a charge of possession of heroin. On July 6, he was a passenger in a car that was stopped and found to be in possession of charred tinfoil which gardaí suspected contained traces of heroin. It was sent for analysis and found not to contain heroin, according to Gsoc.
Shane’s sister, Gemma, had complained to Gsoc about a Garda delay in testing the sample. Her complaint was not upheld.
On July 14, 2011, three weeks before Shane’s death, Gridziuška was arrested in Newry on charges of theft of trainers, perfume and alcohol. The next day he appeared before Newry Magistrates Court and was sentenced to five months imprisonment, suspended for two years.
The Gsoc report says that “gardaí were unaware” of Gridziuška’s convictions in the North until July 2012. The O’Farrell family dispute this. In recent days, they have furnished a letter from the PSNI which details the correspondence it had with the Garda.
On the night of Shane’s death, a car owned by Gridziuška and driven by another man was stopped by the Drug Squad. No drugs were found, according to Gsoc. The car’s NCT was not up to date. The driver was not insured. After being stopped by gardaí, the driver swapped with Gridziuška, who drove on. The collision that killed Shane happened an hour later.
Gsoc accepts that if the car had been seized at that point, the fatal collision would have been prevented. But it notes that the gardaí in question were members of the regional drugs unit who were “entitled to a reasonable exercise of their discretion” in relation to road traffic offences. Therefore, it states, no further investigation is required on this decision.
Gridziuška ultimately pleaded guilty to failing to stop at the scene and failure to report the collision. He was acquitted of the more serious charge of dangerous driving causing death. He never served any time in relation to the death.
But the real issue of both private and public concern is that Gridziuška was driving the car when he had a series of criminal offences to his name.
“The question at the heart of the O’Farrells’ complaints is why the individual was not brought back before the courts, in order that the judge could have been informed and executed the sentence that was hanging over the individual being put in jail,” said O’Callaghan.
Gsoc was not answering important questions that disclosed “significant inefficiencies and failings in the criminal justice system”, O’Callaghan contiued. He is calling for a commission of investigation.
His colleague John McGuinness, who has been highlighting the case for years, said: “It is not just the O’Farrell family who deserve it. The state deserves it. The system, from the DPP down to the courts, needs to be examined.”
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald is supporting the call for a public inquiry. She strongly criticised the Gsoc report, saying that there was “little evidence or explanation to underpin its conclusions” and that it includes statements “that are simply erroneous”.
Among the issues that any inquiry would have to examine is the bail system. Almost 600 crimes were committed every week by people on bail last year, according to figures from the CSO.
There are also big problems with enforcing safety on the roads. Of the 9,449 drivers disqualified in court in 2017, just 1,289 surrendered their licences, according to a response to a parliamentary question to independent TD Tommy Broughan.
This means 8,160 disqualified drivers are still on the road.
Lucia O’Farrell has written to Leo Varadkar on a monthly basis since he became taoiseach a year ago. Her son never got to fulfil his potential of a promising legal career. But she will not give up until she has answers to the questions that go to the very heart of the system in which he had hoped to spend his working life.

Abortion: What happens now?

Highlight: A range of issues will have to be resolved before abortion is introduced, from whether an ultrasound will be obligatory to the role of GPs and whether foeticide will be permitted in certain circumstances 
Body


Officials from the Department of Health, the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG) were among those who met last week to discuss how abortion services might be developed in Ireland. Given the decisive result in the referendum on the Eighth Amendment, the government is anxious to progress legislation that will facilitate abortion services as quickly as possible. “I am eager to now implement the will of the people without delay,” said Minister for Health Simon Harris last week.
Harris said it was the aim of his department to publish legislation to regulate abortion in Ireland within six weeks.
•	Will pregnant women be required to have an ultrasound scan to confirm the gestation?
•	Will GPs come on board, and how?
•	Will women seeking a medical abortion have to take the abortion pills in the presence of a nurse or doctor?
•	Will legislators allow foeticide to occur in special circumstances as other countries do?
•	Are we going to see litigation in cases of so-called wrongful birth?
There are two types of abortion: medical abortion (abortion pills) and surgical abortion.
A medical abortion typically involves taking two medicines. The first medicine ends the pregnancy, while the second medicine causes cramping, bleeding and the loss of the pregnancy similar to a miscarriage.
According to Britain’s Department of Health, abortion statistics for England and Wales show that 62 per cent of terminations (in 2016) were medical, while 38 per cent were surgical. It is expected that most of the terminations that will take place in Ireland, once legislation is passed by the Oireachtas and commenced, will be medical abortions.
The government has indicated that the abortion regime it envisages would be GP-led.
GP groups have maintained there would have to be provision in any new arrangements for conscientious objection.
The Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), one of the main representative groups for GPs, said: “If the service is to be introduced the role of the IMO will be to ensure that GPs who choose to provide the service are properly resourced to deliver an appropriate and safe service for patients.”
In March, a survey of almost 500 GPs found that almost two-thirds would not be prepared to act as providers of abortion pills. Instead, the survey (by gpbuddy.ie, a closed doctors’ forum) found that GPs would favour following Britain’s example where women are referred by general practitioners to dedicated clinics for medical abortions.
Equally, various GPs have also spoken about their willingness to provide an abortion service.
Doctors for Choice has said it believes that a GP-led abortion service of 100 “champion practices” located across the country, coupled with non-GP groups like the Irish Family Planning Association, would be enough to meet women’s needs.
Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Cliona Murphy, who is incoming chair of the IOG, said the exact way in which abortion services would be provided in Ireland had yet to be agreed and determined.
For example, it has yet to be decided whether an ultrasound will always be required to help doctors establish the gestational age of a pregnancy before an abortion is carried out.
“The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines say ultrasound is not absolutely necessary but, speaking to colleagues, a lot are uncomfortable with that especially from nine or ten weeks onwards,” said Murphy.
Dr Nóirín Russell said she believed that women who were more than nine weeks pregnant would probably need to get an ultrasound so that doctors and women could be certain of the gestation.
Some abortion providers overseas, including the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), insist that all women get an ultrasound in advance of getting an abortion. Some providers also do this to rule out ectopic pregnancies (where the embryo attaches outside the uterus).
“There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not scans are going to be necessary for all women. People are terrified about ruptured ectopic pregnancies. [An ectopic pregnancy is one where the embryo attaches outside the uterus.] Actually, the rate of ruptured ectopic pregnancies after a medical abortion is very low – 7 per 100,000. It is quite low. It is not an indication for scanning everybody,” Russell said.
Even if medical groups decide against providing all women with an ultrasound in advance of an abortion, there will be an inevitable increase in demand on ultrasound services that are already severely stretched. According to a 2016 research study which Russell co-authored with Dr Keelin O’Donoghue and others, about one third of pregnant women in Ireland could not access a routine foetal anomaly scan.
An estimated 4,600 women in Ireland sought terminations in 2016 (at least 3,265 travelled to English and Welsh abortion clinics while approximately 1,354 procured abortion pills online).
Should 20-30 per cent seek surgical abortions, how will the system cope with the additional demand that will inevitably arise?
There was some confusion last week about the licensing of medicines for medical termination. Typically two drugs are used to bring about an abortion: mifepristone and misoprostol.
The first medicine, mifepristone, ends the pregnancy. It works by blocking the vital hormone progesterone, without which the lining of the uterus breaks down and the pregnancy cannot continue. The second, misoprostol, makes the womb contract and triggers the loss of pregnancy similar to a miscarriage.
The Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) issued a statement to RTÉ saying that no medicine for medical termination of pregnancy was currently authorised in Ireland. Some obstetricians were surprised by the statement, as both mifepristone and misoprostol are already used in maternity units across the country.
Consultant obstetrician Dr Keelin O’Donoghue said these medicines have been “used in every maternity hospital in the country for quite some time”. The medicines, she said, were used to provide terminations when a woman’s life was at risk under current legislation, or to induce labour after a baby dies in utero in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Mifepristone is only given in the presence of a doctor and a register is kept of its use. In a subsequent statement to this newspaper, the HPRA acknowledged that these medicines were already used by doctors in Ireland.
In a statement, the HPRA said: “There are certain clinical situations when the use of a medicine outside the terms of the marketing authorisation (ie ‘off-label’) may be judged to be in the best interests of the patient on the basis of available evidence and such decisions rest with the registered medical practitioner. In other cases, a medical practitioner may wish to prescribe an unauthorised medicine for a patient under his/her care.
“An unauthorised medicine may be one that is an authorised medicine in another country or it may be a product made up to a specific order from a registered medical practitioner to meet the special needs of a particular patient. This is provided for in the European Medicinal Products Directive (2001/83/EC) and is transposed in Irish legislation where such an unauthorised medicine is termed an ‘exempt medicinal product’. The manner in which it is prepared for administration determines whether it is off-label use or the use of an exempt medicinal product.”
Given that medical abortion is likely to be the preferred choice for most women who decide to terminate their pregnancies, demand for the so-called abortion pill is likely to soar once abortion is legalised. More widespread use of these drugs would require them to be licensed for the specific purpose of terminating a pregnancy.
The HPRA has estimated that it would take about 90 days for this to happen.
Doctors, and possibly legislators, will also have to decide whether it is best to allow women to take abortion pills (up to 12 weeks) in their own homes. Under current legislation in England and Wales, a woman must take the pills – issued with the consent of two doctors – inside a hospital or licensed clinic. This means they must make two visits to the hospital or clinic to take the pills in the presence of a doctor or nurse. These pills are typically taken 24 hours apart when terminating an early pregnancy.
The law in Scotland, where medical abortions accounted for 83 per cent of terminations in 2016, was changed last year to allow women under nine weeks pregnant to take the pills at home.
Professor Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), supported the move and said it was another step in making it easier for women to access safe care.
Generally speaking, the earlier the abortion pill is given the lower the complication rate. While complications are rare they can and will inevitably arise. One in ten medical abortions under ten weeks will need follow-up care or surgical treatment. In its guidelines, Best Practice in Comprehensive Abortion Care, the RCOG advises of various risks that can arise.
For example, surgical intervention can be needed following a medical abortion. Severe bleeding and uterine rupture are other known complications – although they are very rare. Dr Nóirín Russell said all of this would lead to increased demand on existing services and operating theatres.
Particular challenges are expected to emerge when it comes to late surgical terminations and terminations of pregnancy because of a fatal foetal abnormality. In Britain, terminations of such late-term pregnancies after 22 weeks involve foeticide. This is where the foetal heartbeat is stopped with an injection before an induction takes place. “In France, that happens after 21 weeks,” said Russell. There has been no mention of foeticide in the guidelines that were published by the Department of Health.
Dr Keelin O’Donoghue said that this would likely lead to live births following termination of pregnancy at later gestations, as not all babies with fatal anomalies will die during labour or within minutes or hours of birth. (Beyond 12 weeks, it will only be legal to carry out a termination of pregnancy when two medical practitioners certify that there is a risk to the life of or risk of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman.)
Guidelines from the RCOG spell this out clearly: “Live birth following termination of pregnancy before 21 [+6 days] weeks of gestation is very uncommon. Nevertheless, women and their partners should be counselled about this unlikely possibility and staff should be trained to deal with this eventuality,” the RCOG states.
The RCOG goes on to say that “live birth becomes increasingly common after 22 weeks of gestation and, when a decision has been reached to terminate the pregnancy for a foetal abnormality after 21 [+6 days] weeks, foeticide should be routinely offered.”
O’Donoghue said doctors in other countries had faced legal actions for ‘wrongful birth’ when babies were born alive after attempted abortions and lived, or had active interventions to prolong life.
“I worry that we will be very exposed on this issue as the [general scheme that was published] does not allow for foeticide if there is consensus not to undertake this practice, and I understand why many would feel this way. We need to understand the consequences and explain them,” she said.
“Some of these babies could live longer than originally anticipated and that will create a lot of challenges for parents and for clinicians.”
In Britain, parents of unborn children with fatal foetal abnormalities can choose between delivery and comfort care or prior foeticide and induction.
O’Donoghue said obstetricians and neonatal specialists would have to liaise closely in order to provide the best possible care under these circumstances. “This is about much more than legislation. We need to seriously invest in women’s health. Doing this well is going to require money and a lot of resources,” Russell said.

Activist investor ups stake in IFG as F&#38;C steps back

An activist investor has upped its stake in financial services group IFG, raising pressure on the company as one of its largest shareholders has offloaded most of its position.
London-based Strategic Equity Capital, which has previously been critical of IFG, has raised its stake in the company to 9.74 per cent from 8.11 per cent making it the biggest shareholder ahead of former chairman John Gallagher. The move came last week as investment giant F&C disposed of nearly all of its shares in the company. F&C, a long-time investor in IFG, reduced its position to 0.1 per cent from 8 per cent.
As part of the share movements in IFG last week, a number of funds have emerged as significant investors. The investment arm of Duke University, an American college, has taken a stake of 3.2 per cent in IFG, while Ennismore Fund Management, another British-based investor, has emerged as owner of just over 4.2 per cent. Meanwhile, Farringdon Capital Management, which is a shareholder in a number of Irish small and midcap companies, has moved its holding to 8.8 per cent from 6.9 per cent.
According to market sources, the company could be pushed for a break-up in a bid to deliver greater returns to shareholders.
A number of brokers have downgraded their forecasts for how much profit the company is expected to make this year because of higher costs to retain key staff at its wealth management division and because of a potential legacy legal issue related to a claim against it by Britain’s tax authority.
Sources believe that the new management team, led by chief executive Kathryn Purves, should undertake a major review of the business to either sell the entire company, break it up or continue as it is with a plan to expand.
Earlier this year, IFG said it had considered a number of unsolicited takeover approaches for Saunderson House, its London-based wealth management arm. It said it decided not to proceed with a deal as it would present “significant execution risks” and would instead focus on growing the business. It also awarded the senior managers at Saunderson House £1.5 million in retention awards this year and next in an effort to expand the company.
Shares in Dublin-headquartered IFG have fallen about 30 per cent so far this year, giving the company a value of just under €153 million.

Father John Misty : God’s Favourite Customer (Bella Union)
Even casual fans of Father John Misty should swoop on this record quicker than a seagull on a dropped carton of curry chips. On God’s Favourite Customer, Josh Tillman (aka Father John Misty) delivers a remarkable array of songs, exploring heartbreak, freedom and the constriction of long-term relationships. Sadness percolates the record (“I’m going to get out with my skin/And start my life again”), but there’s also a sense of exhilaration from tracks including Mr Tillman and particularly Date Night, which swings harder than a bored husband at a car-key party. Despite the mood changes, Tillman keeps the tone impressively cohesive – his persuasive voice still recalls Elton John, and it’s lit up here by satisfyingly bluesy guitar (Please Don’t Die), wistful piano (The Palace, The Songwriter) and warm, intimate production, helmed by Tillman himself. 
The lyrics, meanwhile, are as smart, self-aware and modern as you’d expect. “It’s only been three weeks/And a bag of speed/From Jamie the PhD,” Tillman sings on The Palace. “Last night, I texted your iPhone/Said I think I’m ready to come home.” We’re only halfway through the year, but you can expect God’s Favourite Customer to linger in the upper end of the best albums of the year list come December.

Lykke Li: So Sad So Sexy (RCA)
Fans of dreamy pop and slinky dance will be pleased that Swedish singer Li Lykke Timotje Zachrisson (to give her real name an airing) decided to reverse her decision not to make music. Such a pronouncement arrived in 2014 after the release of her third album, I Never Learn, but retirement never happened. The roots of Li’s fourth album lay in the collaborative processes between her and what she has termed a ‘supergroup’ of Swedish and American songwriters (which includes members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn & John). Whatever about the processes, the results are outstanding. While smart producers like Rostam Batmanglij and Jeff Bhasker (Li’s real-life partner) have reconfigured the sound to merge elements of state-of-the-art R&B/hip-hop with Li’s luxuriant Swedish pop, there’s another aspect that fits right into the overall mix – a preference for explorative lyrics. As the music effortlessly seeps in, equal parts stealth and seductive, Li sings about the kind of stuff that can keep us awake for hours. It’s a fine balance, but the blend is flawless.

Lump: Lump (Dead Oceans)
In taking a neat sidestep away from her superlative sequence of solo albums, British singer-songwriter Laura Marling has made a wise decision. Her ideas of folk music were in danger of becoming too tried and tested, and so her alliance with another British musician and songwriter (Mike Lindsay of alt-folk group Tuung) is clearly a way into something else. The songwriters first met two years ago, and the result is an album of two halves. One side is Marling’s newfound lyrical influences, which frame the sublime wordplay of Scottish poet Ivor Cutler and the whimsical output of English poet Edward Lear. The other side is Lindsay’s deft sonic soundscapes, which are as impressionistic and refined as you can imagine. Built around a six-song cycle, the combination of the two outwardly idiosyncratic musicians is an object lesson in creative collusion. Neither impacts overtly on each other’s contribution, yet there’s a distinctive edge to each that is their own. It isn't always smooth, but it’s never less than intriguing.

Gift Voucher Shop (GVS), the operator of the One4all card scheme, is on the brink of being sold for about €110 million.
The buyer of the business, which is 53.6 per cent owned by An Post, is Blackhawk Network Holdings, a multibillion-dollar business that operates in the pre-paid gift card and payments industries.
Blackhawk is led in Europe by Irishman Jonathan Kenny. In January, Nasdaq-listed Blackhawk said it had agreed a take-private deal with private equity firm Silver Lake and investment fund P2 Capital Partners.
The deal, which is set to close soon, including debt, valued Blackhawk at $3.5 billion.
GVS appointed Investec Corporate Finance earlier this year to sell GVS. The Irish company made pre-tax profits of €5.9 million in 2016 versus €3.9 million the previous year. Turnover increased from €11.2 million to €13.8 million in the same period.
The business is 53.6 per cent owned by An Post with the remainder owned by private investors including chief executive Michael Dawson who owns about 10 per cent of its shares.
Smaller shareholders include businessman Conor Haughey, the eldest son of former taoiseach Charles Haughey.
One4all cards work with over 6,000 businesses including well-known names such as Arnotts, House of Fraser, TK Maxx, Dublin Zoo and Foot Locker.
In early 2013, the company faced false rumours spread on social media that it was going to close down despite its state backing.
Dawson spent €250,000 on advertising to fight the false rumours which he later described as an “assassination attempt”.
Dawson, a former Fianna Fáil senator, has invested heavily in recent years expanding into Britain. “Every bloody penny we made in Ireland we were reinvesting in the UK - and more besides. It really slowed us down; I had planned to sail away in a yacht by that stage,” he said in an interview some years ago.
He is estimated to make €10 million before tax from the sale. Dawson was previously campaign manager for Brian Lenihan sr’s unsuccessful attempt to be elected president which was set back by his “mature recollection” of a phone call to Áras an Uachtaráin in 1982.
Blackhawk is a good strategic fit for One4All as it already has a substantial presence in Europe offering similar services. Blackhawk’s European regional leader Netherlands-based Kenny has been an investor or member of management in four successful exits with a combined enterprise value of over €350 million.
He recently emerged as an investor in Pat Phelan’s new aestheic clinic chain SISU. The acquisition of GVS by Blackhawk is the latest in a series of acquisitions by the company since it floated in 2013 raising $200 million on the stock market. The semi-state’s windfall from the sale of GVS will allow An Post invest further in modernising its business as well as potentially fund redundancies if required.

ATXA secures €2.5m in funding to research new cardiovascular drugs

Body


ATXA Therapeutics, a University College Dublin (UCD) life sciences spin-out, which is developing novel therapeutic drugs to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and other related cardiovascular conditions, has secured €2.5 million in funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Programme Phase 2.
The company is one of just three Irish companies to secure funding in this latest round. Only 64 companies from across Europe, out of 1,280 applications, were successful in securing funding in this scheme and were granted a total of €110 million.
ATXA Therapeutics was founded by Professor Therese Kinsella as a spin-out from the UCD School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science at the UCD Conway Institute.
PAH is a devastating disease of the lung and heart with an urgent, unmet need for new improved therapies.
While the condition itself is classed as a rare or orphan disease, affecting 15-50 patients per million of the population, it carries an enormous health burden with an annual spend of $6 billion globally on prescribed medicines alone.
ATXA has recently been awarded orphan designation from the European Medicines Agency and from the FDA for NTP42, its lead drug for PAH.
Securing the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Award will be a key accelerant in bringing ATXA’s NTP42 closer to the market by advancing the drug into clinical development.
“This is a wonderful endorsement of ATXA’s overall mission and validation of its achievements to date. We hope that this strong Europe-wide recognition of ATXA’s overall goal of bringing a new drug to the market for PAH will go a long way to bringing other investors on-board as part of its current fund-raise campaign,” said Kinsella.
Tom Flanagan, UCD’s director of enterprise and commercialisation, welcomed the funding announcement.
“I would like to congratulate ATXA Therapeutics, a UCD life sciences spin-out company, on today’s announcement that it has secured €2.5 million in the latest Horizon 2020 SME Instrument funding round.
“This is a significant milestone which will enable the ATXA team to drive the company forward in its development of novel therapeutic drugs to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension,” he said.
“ATXA was one of only three Irish companies, out of 64 companies across Europe, to secure funding in this latest round which demonstrates the quality and global impact potential of the companies emerging from the world-class research programmes taking place at the University.
“UCD spin-outs have a strong track record in securing Horizon 2020 SME Instrument funding and today’s announcement builds on the previous success of companies such as OncoMark and SiriusXT.”

Aughinish back in the firing line as Trump trade war heats up

Ireland has been caught in the crosshairs of the outbreak of a trade war between the US and Europe with further pressure being heaped on the already beleaguered Aughinish Alumina plant in Limerick.
The move by Donald Trump’s administration to slap tariffs on European, Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminium imports came as the Irish government and the Russian owners of Aughinish were preparing moves to rescue it from US sanctions.
The fate of Aughinish has been up in the air since April when the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) said it would slap sanctions on its owner, UC Rusal, as part of a crackdown on assets owned by a number of Russian oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin. Last Thursday the chairman of EN+, the parent company of Rusal, held talks with Irish government officials, including business minister Heather Humphreys, about how the plant could be rescued from sanctions.
Greg Barker, a former British government minister and now chairman of EN+, pressed the Irish side to lobby the US to extend the date before the sanctions kicked in to give the company time to reduce the control over it by its majority owner Oleg Deripaska.
The Barker plan envisages Deripaska’s interest falling below 50 per cent so it can comply with the OFAC rules. But that effort could come to nothing as the US now plans to hit European producers of aluminium with a 10 per cent import tariff.
The US has set a deadline of early August for Deripaska to sever his links with the company or firms will have to cut their ties with his empire, which would probably deliver a fatal blow to Aughinish, as most of its suppliers and even its banks would have to cease dealing with it. Barker wants the deadline of August pushed out to the end of October to allow his plan to work.
In a statement late last Friday, EN+ said the plan “has made significant progress against a backdrop of an unprecedented and unforeseen corporate issue”.
Although Ireland does not export aluminium directly to the US, Aughinish accounts for about 30 per cent of Europe’s aluminium production, such is the scale of its output.
“As has been widely reported, efforts are under way by Rusal and EN+ to restructure their respective ownerships. This extension provides the companies with more time to make arrangements that – subject to the approval of the US authorities - could result in the sanctions being lifted,” the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation said in a statement.
“The government continues to engage intensively on the issue. Minister Humphreys met on Thursday with Gregory Barker, chairman of EN+, who is coordinating the company’s response to the sanctions. The minister made clear that the government is continuing to prioritise finding a solution that will safeguard the long-term future of the Aughinish plant.”
Aughinish Alumina employs 450 people directly and hundreds more in companies that supply it. It is the largest foreign direct investment project in the midwest.

Bang & Olufsen has invested €300,000 in the launch of its new store on Dublin’s Duke Street. The store is operated by NuConnect, the largest Bang & Olufsen retail group in Ireland and Britain.
The store is being headed up by Andy Williamson, who has been with the business for eight years. Bang & Olufsen chief entrepreneur, Anders Buchmann, welcomed the opening of the Dublin store.
“Before consumers wanted sound, and lots of it. Sound outputs positioned at different touchpoints in their lives, different rooms in their homes. Now we see a very clear movement to a demand for better sound quality, but also technology that either blends in or really stands out. At Bang & Olufsen we pride ourselves on crafting beautiful visual statements through working with top designers such as Oivind Slaatto,” said Buchmann.
“Many people are shocked when one of our sound systems is activated, as with products such as the BeoSound Shape, countless think it is just a gorgeous art installation on a wall. We are excited to continue to design these innovative products and bring them to the Irish market through our new Duke Street store.”
Jason Smith, the head of NuConnect, said it was the right time for the business to expand. “We have such a loyal customer base in Ireland who have been crying out for a physical store in the city centre, in order to experience and play with our top-of-the-range products, to identify which best meets the needs of their lifestyle,” he said.

Banks are struggling to remain relevant

Not long after the Church, another great edifice of Irish life took a fall – the banks. It will be a long time before we forget September 30, 2008, the night of the bank guarantee. It will also be a long time before we forget the €64 billion bailout, or the antics played out in the infamous Anglo Tapes.
But we remember, too, the bogus non-resident accounts controversies of the 1990s, the misselling of payment protection insurance, and multiple large-scale instances of rampant over-charging. Looking back now at the range of controversies that our banks have been embroiled in over the past decades, it is a wonder that we have ever trusted them with our money.
Poor lending decisions by all of the retail banks were a huge factor in both the creation of Ireland’s property bubble and the subsequent collapse of our banking system. While banks may have emerged from the worst effects of the recession and are turning a profit, their reputations remain badly tarnished.
Time and again, when it came to doing the right thing when no one was looking, our banks have failed us. And as recent experience with the tracker mortgage scandal has shown us, even when someone was looking, they needed to be dragged kicking and screaming and forced to do the right thing.
So what exactly is the problem with our banking system?
There is a deeply-ingrained cultural problem within the banks and, short of firing en masse the staff who insist on doing things the old way at the behest of the Central Bank of Ireland, leadership in the banks have no choice but to deliver transformation. That includes a change of culture and mindset.
To function at its best, a market must be competitive. And, sadly, this dynamic is noticeably absent from the Irish banking market, and has been for quite some time. Take mortgage lending as just one indicator of this. ECB lending rates sit at close to zero and in fact have been below 1 per cent for five years. Yet in the magical world of Irish banks, variable mortgage lending rates are stubbornly high (the typical variable rate on a 90 per cent mortgage is at around 4 per cent).
In contrast, mortgage rates in France, Germany and Spain stand at around 2 per cent. While recognising that Irish banks have made moves to improve their fixed rates, the inescapable truth is that in a correctly functioning market with meaningful competition, house-buyers would not be faced with variable rates which bear no relation whatsoever to the ECB rate.
The artificially high mortgage interest rates stand as a vulnerability in the event of an increase in interest rates.
A financial stability note published by the Central Bank of Ireland earlier this week looks at the vulnerability of mortgaged Irish households to certain financial shocks. It considers the likely impact on mortgage holders if property prices were to fall by 4 per cent, if interest rates were to rise by 1.1 per cent and unemployment was to rise by 3.3 per cent.
While a rise in unemployment seems unlikely in the near term, in view of the heated nature of the housing market and where we are on the interest rate curve, those two projections don’t seem fanciful. The Central Bank Note finds that, under the adverse scenario, an average of 6 per cent of loans with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios would be at risk of default each year.
While I am generally not supportive of state intervention in the marketplace, I feel that the banks’ mortgage interest rates were (and continue to be) exploitative. That is why, in 2015, I published a bill in the Seanad which would have empowered the Central Bank to cap mortgage interest rates as a temporary, exceptional measure. However, as time has shown, both the government and the Central Bank have failed to call a halt to the banks’ profiteering on the backs of workers who must meet artificially high mortgage repayments.
Another sign that the banking market is dysfunctional is the fact that the government’s Microfinance Ireland entity continues to provide finance to SMEs which still cannot secure a bank loan. The government’s credit guarantee scheme also continues to provide assistance to businesses – again, funding which would, in a properly functioning market, be provided by banks.
As a society, we are slowly learning to transact in business without the help of banks. Crowdfunding has developed well and is increasingly being used to fill gaps in the supply of funds which banks might in the past have provided. Payments is another area of traditional banking where we have been having considerable success without relying on banks – PayPal is a great example of this. The increasing prevalence of cryptocurrencies is another development which risks marginalising banks.
There has been no significant new entrant to the Irish banking market for many years now. Even if banks across Europe were looking for expansion opportunities, the reality may be that due to its scale, the Irish market is not particularly attractive to new entrants. Therefore, of some concern is the suggestions that the leading community-based banking model, called Sparkassen in Germany, has received a cool reception from the government and from the apparatchiks on Merrion Street.
The dysfunctional nature of the Irish banking system is not helped, of course, by the fact that AIB is in the somewhat unusual position of the government holding a 71 per cent stake in the bank. The government’s dominance over the bank is impacting on its ability to operate as a normal business would. We saw recently that AIB had to abandon its pursuit of the Irish arm of specialist bank Investec after the AIB board refused to back the move. With instances such as this, it is of little surprise that last December AIB chief executive Bernard Byrne bluntly called for the state to reduce its shareholding in the bank.
In addition to the Augean task of cleaning up after the controversies of the past, Irish banks are also looking to the future. As in so many other areas, consumer behaviour and expectations of their banks are changing rapidly. So much of our banking is now transacted online. When was the last time you walked into a bank branch?
It has been interesting to watch the development of Starling Bank in Britain – a new bank which was founded by Anne Boden, former chief operating officer at AIB. Starling is one of a handful of new mobile-only, branchless banks which have embraced technology to the full with the result that the account holder is fully in control.
There was much joy, and rightly so, with the appointment of Francesca McDonagh as chief executive of Bank of Ireland. She has set out ambitious plans and has already taken significant steps to reduce staff levels and cut costs at the Bank. Her commitment to delivering gender equality in executive hires by 2021 is a real demonstration of her ability to not only lead Bank of Ireland, but to drive change across the wider financial services system which has been male-dominated at senior levels for far too long.
Challenging, too, will be the task of grappling with the €6.5 billion of non-performing loans on the bank’s books. When announcing the bank’s 2017 results earlier this year, McDonagh pointed out that Bank of Ireland has already achieved a 31 per cent reduction in non-performing exposures and made clear that the bank has no intention of selling off its non-performing loans. McDonagh has rightly identified the restoration of trust at the bank as being key, and this will probably be the toughest mountain for the bank to climb.
The Nyberg report on the causes of the systemic banking crisis in Ireland (2011) speaks of the trust which we as a society placed in a soft landing for our booming economy. Nyberg also refers to the “efficient market hypothesis” which bankers and policy makers favoured during the boom.
Under this hypothesis, there was an assumption that self-regulating financial markets tended to remain stable. There was, he said, “a globally widespread basic assumption that financial market problems by their very nature were temporary”. How wrong they were!
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the degree of supervision of banks and other financial institutions really came into focus. The newly appointed head of financial regulation at the Central Bank of Ireland at that time – Matthew Elderfield – had the unenviable task of tidying up the mess which had been left following years of inept supervision. He left a lasting legacy. We have moved from principles-based regulation combined with light-touch supervision to now having prescriptive legislative requirements along with an intrusive level of supervision.
It had to happen. And while firms may complain that the pendulum has swung too far and is constraining, consumers can now invest their trust in the regulator, rather than the banks.

Highlight: Last week’s referendum result did not herald the advent of secularisation in Ireland. It had already quietly arrived in the hearts and minds of Irish people 
Body


The narrative around the abortion referendum was one where the overwhelming Yes vote was framed as a “rebuke to Catholic Conservatism”, to quote the blazing New York Times headline. Indeed, journalist Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura referenced the Catholic Church on 16 separate occasions in her New York Times report on the referendum result.
Irish newspapers also bought into that storyline of a closed, conservative Catholic country which has now become one of Europe’s most liberal, outward-looking states.
The ripples of that narrative were felt all week.
Catholics who voted Yes to repeal the Eighth Amendment “should consider coming to confession”, the Bishop of Elphin Kevin Doran told listeners on RTÉ Radio 1’s Today with Sean O’Rourke programme. You cannot vote in favour of abortion and be allowed to marry in a Catholic church, wrote Fr Patrick McCafferty in the Belfast Telegraph. St Vincent de Paul must remove its clothing bank from the Church-owned car park in Dunboyne, Co Meath because the charity had refused to take a No stand in the abortion referendum, parish priest Fr Patrick O’Connor said.
The prominence these stories received suggested that the views of the Catholic clergy on social issues still mattered.
The Irish people have publicly disagreed with Catholic Church teaching at the ballot box on three separate issues over the last 23 years.
A majority rejected the constitutional prohibition on divorce. We became the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote. Over two-thirds of the electorate voted to liberalise abortion law to allow unrestricted termination of pregnancy up to 12 weeks.
Last week’s referendum result did not herald the advent of secularisation in Ireland. It had already quietly arrived in the hearts and minds of Irish people. It was not an urban phenomenon. It was not an instinctive knee-jerk reaction to the dominance of the Catholic Church. To describe it in that manner does a disservice to what has happened in Ireland. This was a low-key, understated and nonchalant revolution.
I have watched the big-shouldered farming men in our rural pub talk about the same-sex marriage and abortion referendums. The debates were the same. The dominant voices shout their opinions against change, banging the counter with authority and assuming the silence of their neighbours was tacit agreement. Then you get them on their own, one-to-one, and the heartbreaking stories of their fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters flow from them like rivers into the sea.
The disappearance of women from “well-respected” families who went to Dublin or England to work when their tummies became too big. The babies reared as siblings who were really uncles or aunts. The stories at funerals of “children coming out of the woodwork” whose assumed motivation was inheritance. That terrible burden of respectability, reputation and land that broke families and made communities complicit in illegal adoptions.
There is space now for those conversations, for the silent reflections and the acknowledgement of what went before. You see on the boundaries of graveyards where gravestones have been erected recently for the un-baptised children who died decades ago. The stigma of the doctrine of limbo rejected and replaced with smalls acts of dignity in the Irish countryside.
That repeated rejection of Catholic teaching in the ballot box has been made by people who say “God bless” as a goodbye and “Jesus, Mary and Joseph” as an expression of shock. People who put bouncy castles in their garden to celebrate their child’s communion and who put a Child of Prague outside the night before a wedding in the hope of good weather.
Many of us may not go to mass every week but we are cultural Catholics who make the sign of the cross when passing a church and observe the religious rituals of baptism, marriage and death.
Maybe it has been these everyday habits and customs, where the Angelus bells are transmitted twice a day on Irish national radio and television, that have allowed us to assume that the secularisation of Irish society is an overnight wonder that has suddenly happened to us. This is a paradox where the Knock shrine in Mayo attracts more visitors each year than the Guinness Storehouse or the Cliffs of Moher.
These contradictions between public expressions of Catholicism and the private statements at the ballot box have fooled media narratives of closeted conservatism and the politicians who accepted it.
Niall Collins TD was quick to point out this failing. “The country went 70-30 in one way, the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party went 80-20 in the opposite direction,” the Limerick politician observed.
In my own constituency of Carlow Kilkenny, five of the six Oireachtas representatives were No voters, yet almost two-thirds of the electorate voted Yes to repealing the Eighth Amendment. The Kilkenny Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness said the results represented “a huge shift in views in society”.
That comment is exactly why politicians and others are out of touch with the Irish people. The shift had already happened. Asked when they decided how to vote, 75 per cent told the RTÉ exit poll they always knew. Almost a third said the experiences of people they knew were a factor that influenced their vote.
The politicians and Official Ireland may still think they are fighting battles with the Church. Despite the cultural contradictions of the Irish people, they have won those battles every time when asked at the ballot box.

Highlight: Ireland’s premium burger revolution has taken hold, and we’re constantly on the hunt for the perfect meat-filled bun. Sublime? Ridiculous? Róisín Kiberd digs into the very juicy business of the Irish burger 
Body


Nobody needs to be told what’s in a ‘real’ hamburger. It’s among the most familiar, most widely-eaten foods in existence. The burger’s flat, colourful strata – bread, lettuce, cheese, meat and bread again – are so recognisable as to be iconic. It’s a fast-food fix and a gourmet favourite, a visual signifier of both hunger and satiation.
Yes, nobody needs to be told what’s in a ‘real’ hamburger. Yet, under scrutiny, the very concept of it falls apart, like a poorly-assembled beef patty on a grill. The hamburger has changed dramatically in recent years, not least in Ireland, where restaurants have employed unusual business models, new cooking methods and experimental recipes, giving rise to a brave new burger.
In early summer 2017, a sign appeared in Dublin 6 reading: “Make Ranellagh great again”. The locale, Ranelagh, could only have been misspelled on purpose, and – as if to add insult to injury – the sign had also been printed in Comic Sans font.
The sign turned out to be stunt marketing, announcing a new branch of Bunsen, and all was no doubt forgiven on their first day, during which they handed out free burgers. Recently named in the Financial Times FT1000 as one of Europe’s fastest-growing companies, the minimalist, burger-centric restaurant (their menu, offering only burgers, cheeseburgers and doubles of each, is so short that it fits on a business card) is leading a minor burger renaissance in Dublin and beyond. And, unlike Donald Trump, whose hyperbolic slogan they cribbed, this is a cause we can all get behind (even vegans – more on this later).
I spoke to Tom Gleeson, Bunsen’s founder, via email. When Bunsen first opened its doors in 2013, Dublin already had a number of ‘gourmet burger’ restaurants, but Bunsen’s highly simplified menu was something of a gamble.
[caption id="attachment_417793" align="alignleft" width="691"] David Crawley Fay, head chef at Cleaver East, prepares to tuck into a Pornburger Pic: Fergal Phillips[/caption]
“I think burgers have been a strong trend for years in Ireland,” Gleeson says. “Some of the bigger chains were getting complacent in terms of quality and service, and customers were increasingly educated on what a good burger was.”
Doubtless the internet played a role in this, introducing a trend for comfort food and edible Americana, which showed up as mouthwatering under Instagram filters. Gleeson grew up eating burgers in Dublin, but it was a period spent living in New York that proved transformative, leading him to the idea of burgers as a business model.
“I just wondered why we couldn’t do the same in Ireland. The options available at the time fell between two stools: tower-like chef creations, served on a chopping board, that you needed retractable jaws to eat, or low-quality hockey puck-style patties.”
After studying business and politics in college, Gleeson worked in restaurants including Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck and Le Bernardin in New York. When it came to opening a restaurant of his own he settled on simplicity, researching burgers and only burgers: “I knew our small menu would alienate some people from the start: vegetarians, for one! People said I was crazy. But I thought if the burger tasted good enough, the business would be able to survive, because so many people like burgers.”
Bunsen’s success is testament to Ireland’s enduring burger-mania, and Gleeson himself is so dedicated to the dish that he lived on burgers solidly for 100 days straight, in the busy days immediately after the restaurant opened. “I knew that Irish beef is our equivalent of French champagne or Italian olive oil, but I wasn’t seeing that in the burgers. So, like how most businesses start, I decided to solve the problem for myself and set to work in my parents’ kitchen, trying to recreate the delicious juicy burgers I had in New York.”
The resulting menu is elegant and brutally minimal: there’s the burgers, and there’s a choice of hand-cut, shoestring or sweet potato fries. The beef is minced on-premises and steamed in the final stages of cooking, and staff will ask how you like your burger cooked when you order. The resulting burger is served in ‘Amish dinner rolls’, and the side-servings of chips are generous.
When asked about the menu’s simplicity, Gleeson says: “I think endless choice has two downsides. It’s hard to keep so many ingredients fresh and be sure they are the best quality. Also, it can be hard to make a good decision – one day you might be in the mood for pineapple, a burger and hot sauce, but these three shouldn’t go together.”
The tactic has more than paid off. Bunsen announced a new restaurant in Belfast late last year, adding to its four locations in Dublin (Ranelagh, South Anne Street, Essex Street and the original branch on Wexford Street) and one in Cork (French Church Street).
It’s intriguing how new Irish burger restaurants generally take one of two very different approaches. They’re either burger purists, in the American diner tradition – think Bunsen, new addition Wow Burger and US import Five Guys – or they’re the polar opposite, tongue-in-cheek experimenters with vast, customisable and ever-changing menus.
Older burger restaurants BóBós and Jo’Burger come to mind. The latter are a bit more welcoming to picky eaters, vegans and vegetarians, but ultimately attract a diverse range of customers. (It is at this point, readers, that I reveal myself to be a vegetarian and therefore a woefully unsuitable burger critic. Nevertheless, bear with me . . .)
Bray’s Box Burger neatly fits within this second category. Launched in 2015 by Nicola and Conor Duggan, who also own the nearby Harbour Bar, Cowfish, Pow Bao and Platform Pizza, the burger restaurant occupies a former teenage disco, and its decor is eclectic and charming (think neon, a cinema marquee sign out front and a votive candle stand at the door, which probably once lived in a church before being requisitioned into the deep-fried faith).
Visiting on a warm April evening, we make the short walk from the Dart station and are seated at a table with conveniently-placed plug outlets for phone charging. The restaurant doubles as a cocktail bar, and while it attracts families and customers of all ages, it feels like a distinctly young venue, serving food that’s highly Instagrammable.
[caption id="attachment_417796" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Five Guys: an American import to Ireland’s burger joint scene[/caption]
At first glance, Box Burger’s menu couldn’t be less like Bunsen’s. It’s almost intimidating in its range of options, with 20 different burgers to choose from. There’s a ‘Louisiana’ burger made from cornflake-coated chicken, a ‘Krusty burger’ with crispy pancetta, a fish burger and a Mexican burger which comes with a small iced margarita on the side. Add to this further customisation: you can take or leave the bun, go gluten free, add fries or ‘dirty fries’ (one thing that fascinates me about burger culture is its guilty doublethink around health and its glorious destruction – this plays out on menus in the appearance of ‘dirty fries’, ‘dirty sauce’, and even an entire London-based restaurant chain called Dirty Burger).
Still, at Box Burger there are also plenty of healthy options, and one of the thoughtful, quietly brilliant things about the place is that you won’t feel like a weirdo for requesting a lighter meal. There are four impressive vegetarian options, including a ‘chickpea and PB’ patty, one made from aubergine and parmesan, a seitan double patty (a meat substitute made from wheat gluten, with a rich umami taste) served with vegan cheese, and a beetroot and black bean burger coated in quinoa, which I select.
My companion, a seasoned burger-eater with significantly less pious tastes, chooses a buffalo chicken burger served with bacon, cheese mayonnaise and a cornflake-coated patty. The burgers turn out to be delicious in very different ways; mine is piled high with unusual additions like guacamole, pineapple salsa and red onion infused with lime.
Owner Nicola Duggan stops by to chat just after our food arrives. “People say it’s a phase,” she says, “but the way I see it, the burger has been good forever. When we first opened Box Burger, people were like: ‘It’s just burgers, really?’ But then it started to take off. People know what to expect – they come here with the idea of a burger already in their heads.”
Box Burger was meant as a rebellion against unwieldy tower-shaped burgers, as well as more formal set-ups where you’re expected to order multiple courses: “We wanted the ingredients to come in the same day, and to be served fresh, and we wanted something you could pick up and eat easily instead of that gourmet style where the burger is big and towered.”
As with Bunsen, at Box Burger the burgers are steamed at the last stage of cooking to blend the flavours together, this time in an open kitchen in front of customers. They also have an outlet at Eatyard, the food market attached to the Bernard Shaw, and every so often will drop an entire kitchen into a shipping container and tour the festival circuit, appearing at the Beatyard in Dún Laoghaire, Groove Festival in their hometown of Bray, and Dublin’s BBQ festival The Big Grill, among others.
Box Burger has employed social media marketing to great effect, issuing a call for six professional burger-tasters in March last year, running online competitions and debuting experimental burgers online, including April 1’s ‘#FitFam’ special, a brittle turkey steak sandwiched between two halves of a whole cauliflower and served with a ‘mini H20’ on the side (sorry, raw food enthusiasts, but it turned out to be meant as a joke).
It’s all done with a sense of curiosity and fun: burgers have names like The Cheesus and The Krusty Burger, a Spongebob Squarepants reference. “It’s about moving with the times,” Duggan says. “We enjoy that part of it, really. It’s about always learning: we give our head chef a challenge to come up with a new burger every month. The menu is already quite big – people are always saying we won’t fit anything else onto it. But it’s all about creativity.”
It might seem odd to mention technology so much in relation to burger restaurants, but it’s hard to overstate the influence social media holds over the food industry at present.
It’s a landscape where customers are as likely to order through JustEat or Deliveroo, based on a heavily-filtered, hunger-inducing photo posted by a friend, as they are to actually walk into a bricks-and-mortar restaurant. Instagram, in particular, has done curious things to the food industry, and can be attributed at least in part with the rise of the burger in 2018.
One of the most notable trends is that of the ‘stunt burger’, where some outlandish ingredient has been subbed in to create a truly unusual flavour combination.
Temple Bar’s Cleaver East, a restaurant critically acclaimed for its dry-aged beef cuts, delivers an upmarket version of the trend with its extravagant ‘#pornburger’ series, sold on the first day of every month, but some stunt burgers are more of a dare to potential eaters.
Last year, Holy Smoke, a Cork eatery specialising in pit-smoked barbecue meat, debuted a dish to make cardiologists weep: the Donut Burger includes two beef patties, smoked bacon, crispy onions, melted cheese and ‘dirty sauce’, served up with two glazed doughnuts in place of a bun.
[caption id="attachment_417799" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Nicola Duggan of Box Burger: ‘It’s about moving with the times Pic: Maura Hickey[/caption]
Not to be outdone, Ruby’s Pizza and Grill in Dublin’s Point Village added a Nutella burger to its menu, fried in batter then served in a jam doughnut bun with ice cream as a garnish. Developing on the theme of burger excess, a series of morbidly fascinating ‘eating challenges’ appeared, like that of Aaron’s Takeaway in Kilsheelan, Co Tipperary, which in 2017 created a 14-layer burger comprising 5.25lb of meat (they christened it The Goliath).
Very few of these meals seem genuinely appealing (it’s difficult even to imagine what eating 14 burger patties would do to your insides) and, thankfully, don’t seem to have carried over into the real-life eating habits of Irish people.
Instead, the burger-shaped future looks to be vaguely sci-fi. While it’s unlikely the classic hamburger will disappear, vegetarian and vegan alternatives are finally being taken seriously.
Two companies based in California, Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger, have introduced convincingly ‘meaty’ plant-based burgers into chain restaurants. Impossible Sliders (small burgers costing $1.99 apiece) are sold at White Castle, while Beyond Burgers appear on the menu at TGI Friday’s. Both companies are backed by Bill Gates, and bring veggie burgers deep into the uncanny valley with products that cook, taste, smell and even bleed (thanks to the magic of beetroot juice, we’re told) like actual meat.
While these products have yet to arrive on our shores, Irish restaurants are showing themselves willing to experiment. Vegan cheese is appearing on menus, while chia cheese burgers (Sova Vegan Butcher) and vegan sloppy joe burgers (Happy Food) are also now available.
For more omnivorous tastes, Asian-influenced burgers are on the rise: Millennium Walkway’s Bread and Bones serve kimchi burgers and ‘monster kimchi fries’, while the Ramen Bar on South William Street serves the Niki-man burger, with chashu pork served in a steamed bun. It can’t be long before ramen burgers (with compressed noodles in place of bread), bulgogi burgers (Korean-style grilled and marinated beef) and bao buns arrive here too.
For more of a local take, there are also boxty burgers (L Mulligan Grocer) and Guinness aioli (Block Burger).
While there will always be a place for the classics, it’s exciting to imagine the ways in which this trend will evolve. The burger has been dismantled; the burger has been remade. The ‘real’ hamburger is dead – long live ‘real’ hamburgers.
The Magazine spoke with a number of chefs, one of whom works at a prominent Dublin city centre restaurant, where the ‘fine dining’ take on a humble burger is served, and sells well. “Burgers are a super way of using up off-cuts of meat,” she said. “Higher end restaurants are trimming from good fillets of meat, and mincing on site. It may be good meat, but the markup is even better. Between the burger, bread and toppings, you’d be looking at a ex-overheads cost to the kitchen of €2.50 per burger sold. Considering we sell our burgers from about €15, and charge more for extras, like chips, burgers make brilliant business sense.”

Highlight: On the market at €1.15 million with Sherry FitzGerald, No 63 ticks all the right boxes. It has 196 square metres of living space, five bedrooms, a south-facing rear garden and off-street parking for four cars
Body


Located off Stradbrook Road in Blackrock and within short walking distance of Blackrock village, Monkstown, Deansgrange, a choice of local schools, recreational facilities and transport links, 63 Wynberg Park is certain to be popular with families on the hunt in this affluent Dublin suburb.
On the market at €1.15 million with Sherry FitzGerald, No 63 ticks all the right boxes. It has 196 square metres of living space, five bedrooms, a south-facing rear garden and off-street parking for four cars. It’s in walk-in condition and has been architecturally renovated to create a light-filled, uncluttered interior. But if its location, facilities and turn-key condition are not enough, No 63 also comes with a detached converted mews at the end of the rear garden. The only slight disadvantage is the D1 energy rating, which could be improved by a new owner.
The house was originally built in 1949 and has been well maintained and upgraded by its current owners over the years. Of instant note is the unusual, almost Spanish feature at the front of the house with the arched brickwork facade at the entrance creating a sheltered porch.
A wide, bright and welcoming entrance hall has solid timber floors, a storage/cloaks closet and a guest WC with a porthole window.
French doors from the hall lead to the drawing room to the left, overlooking the front garden. The room has cream carpets and walls and a sandstone fireplace incorporating a gas fire.
The adjacent living room has another sandstone fireplace with a gas fire and a set of glazed patio doors that open to the rear garden.
The fluid, open-plan dining/family room/kitchen is an L-shaped space opening to the rear garden. The interconnecting dining and family rooms both have maple timber floors and are delineated by a central chimney breast that incorporates a multi-fuel stove.
The pale cream fitted German kitchen has base and wall-mounted units with Silestone worktops and upstands, a range of integrated appliances, pale cream floor tiles and double doors to a side patio. The utility room next door has additional cream units, a porthole window and is plumbed for a washing machine and dryer.
The five bedrooms are on the first floor and include three large doubles with built-in wardrobes and two good-sized single bedrooms. There is also a modern shower room and a separate WC. The attic could be converted subject to planning permission.
The detached, stone-cut mews spans the width of the rear garden. Originally the Wynberg House stables, the building was converted in 2009 into a single- storey contemporary mews of 40 square metres, (and has full planning permission). It comes with a walk-in wet room and is currently in use as a home gym and guest accommodation.
The private, south-facing garden between it and the main house has a well-maintained lawn, patio, border shrubs and specimen trees accessed by three sets of patio doors at the rear and side of the house. There’s also double-gated side access and a paved side patio with a raised flowerbed.
For more details or to arrange a viewing, contact Craig Flanagan at Sherry FitzGerald’s Blackrock branch at 01-2880088.

I’m standing next to the Bridle Suite at Claiborne Stud in Paris, Kentucky, surrounded by elegant thoroughbreds, rolling hills and picket fences. Twenty-two Derby winners have been bred here, and a man named Billy Buckler is at hand to talk me through the process. So begins my Kentucky Derby apprenticeship and, with two days to go to the “fastest two minutes in sport”, I’m keen to learn everything I need to help me choose the winner.
Billy introduces me to War Front, a stallion whose services are charged at a cool $250,000 a pop − with three sessions a day in the Bridle Suite, it’s little surprise that his value is $80 million. The legendary Secretariat served out his days here and lies buried in the farm’s grounds. He won the Triple Crown − the title given to the Kentucky, Derby Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes – in 1973.
It’s customary for visitors to leave a coin on Secretariat’s headstone to bring some racing-related luck − and I hope mine will be in on Derby Day. In the meantime, my apprenticeship continues at Taylor Made Farm nursery, a family-friendly farm with café facilities and numerous foals. The hue of blue has faded from the landscape with the dew, and turned to lush green pastures. The Bluegrass State offers the perfect conditions for its two most important exports - horses and bourbon - to thrive, fed by natural spring water bursting through a layer of limestone under the earth.
The hype for Derby Day can be felt on the streets in downtown Lexington as crowds fill the bars in the centre of town enjoying local IPA beers and, of course, bourbon cocktails. I make my way to Dudley’s On Short, where the owner of the restaurant, Debbie Long, greets me warmly. This is the biggest week of the year, and thousands flock in from all over the world to enjoy the pre-derby build up. Kentucky steak is best served rare but this is the northernmost state in the Deep South so delicacies with a Cajun flavour using oysters and soft-shell crab are a must-try. (See dudleysonshort.com.)
About an hour’s drive from the heart of horseland is the town of Louisville, where Churchill Downs racetrack isn’t the only attraction. The city’s most famous son, Muhammad Ali, is remembered at the Ali Centre, a multicultural museum that was opened 12 years ago and has organised programmes serving adults and children. It has worked especially hard on reaching out to people of all religions, cultures and nationalities.
[caption id="attachment_417772" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Above: the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville Pic: AP[/caption]
The museum tells the story of the fateful moment when, as a 12-year-old, Ali’s bike was stolen: a local policeman named Joe Martin advised the youngster that he would need to be able to fight if he found the culprit and so encouraged him to join his gym where he trained boxers.
Ali spent six years under Martin’s guidance and the rest, as they say, is history. There are other pivotal moments highlighted too, particularly Ali’s return from the 1960 Olympics in Rome, when the young boxer was met with a parade and fanfare in his hometown but, later that day, was refused entry to a local diner on the basis of his colour. The story goes that Ali threw his medal into the Ohio river, calling it worthless as he wasn’t a free man.
Ali continued to use his career as a platform to fight for social justice, through his refusal to participate in the Vietnam War. Stripped of his title and status, he stood firmly by his spiritual beliefs right up to his death in 2016. If visiting the centre, take time to view the 20-minute movie which delves deeper into the legacy of the iconic sportsman. (See alicentre.org.)
As part of my pre-Derby training, I need to explore the state’s other great export, bourbon. I swing by the Jim Beam Stillhouse in Clermont to learn the basics that distinguish bourbon from Irish whiskey. Most notably it must contain at least 51 per cent corn, be less than 160 US proof and be made in the US. “Not all bourbon is made in Kentucky, but 100 per cent of the best is,” I’m told by Steve, the bottler, who is showing me how Knob Creek, one of the four Jim Beam small-batch bourbons, is processed.
Bourbon distilleries are dotted in every corner of the state, but Knob Creek is a select bottle being bottled from a single cask, and on Derby Day a special cask is opened and bottled for a lucky few. I’m privileged to be one of these, and even the state’s governor Matthew Bevin shows up to get his bottle. Knob Creek Bourbon took its name from the family homestead of America’s 16th president, Abraham Lincoln. One of the president’s earliest recollections was of Knob Creek a few miles outside Louisville and the happy time he spent there as a child.
Although not from Kentucky, the pioneer Daniel Boone paved a route to Kentucky in 1775 for people such as Lincoln’s family. Boone is buried in Frankfort Graveyard on a picturesque setting overlooking the state capitol, next to the governor’s mansion. His route through the Appalachian Mountains in the east was followed by 200,000 pioneers before the end of the 18th century and is now the gateway to Daniel Boone National Park, a must-see for nature lovers.
The Irish connection is felt strongly in Kentucky, and not just in the landscape. One of the leading lights of industry is Alltech, an Irish company and manufacturer of high-grade animal feed, founded by the late, great Irish entrepreneur Pearse Lyons who passed away earlier this year.
His wife Deirdre continues his legacy along with her son Mark at the plant’s distillery where whiskey and beer are produced. Their connection to Dublin is still strong with the opening of the Pearse Lyons Distillery in St James’s Church in Dublin 8, which was painstakingly restored to its former glory by Deirdre and opened in August 2017. (See pearselyons distillery.com.)
Finally, it’s Derby Day, and up the road at Keeneland racetrack a Derby Day breakfast awaits. I speak to a woman named Dinah who tells me that her ladybug hat, dress and handbag were a year in the planning. A bluegrass orchestra plays to the revellers as we dine on Vermont sausage and home-fried eggs.
[caption id="attachment_417769" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Exhibits at the Kentucky Derby Museum[/caption]
Next stop is Churchill Downs, and with my sweaty palm wrapped tightly around my betting slip, I’m ready to witness my first Kentucky Derby. The rain may be pouring down, but the mood is electric as I find a gap between two spectacular hats.
I’m in the terraces on Millionaire’s Row in the clubhouse at Churchill Downs, where tickets for the top storey of the clubhouse are in the region of $1,200 and harder to find than hen’s teeth.
For that, punters can enjoy the view of the full track and dine on a buffet with delights such as rare beef and mint julep popcorn. Mint juleps are a quintessential part of the Kentucky Derby − a cocktail of bourbon, mint and crushed ice. I’ve called on the services of my friend, the talented Irish designer Claire Garvey, who kindly made me a fascinator for the event, so I blend in with of the ladies on millionaire’s row whose hats have cost thousands of dollars.
The Star-Spangled Banner precedes the main event, and Muhammad Ali’s daughter Laila makes an appearance on the red carpet for the 144th Derby. There is a pot of $1.4 million for the owner of the winning horse − ensuring tensions will reach a crescendo by the time the two minutes have passed.
My money is on Mendelssohn, the Irish horse hotly touted to do well. I’m feeling quietly confident, though slightly anxious, as the roars of 140,000 spectators fill the air for two short minutes. It isn’t to be my day, as my horse comes in last. The triumphant favourite, aptly named Justify, is covered in a blanket of roses as he enters the paddock.
Justify is trained by Bob Baffert and tipped to be in line to win the coveted triple crown of racing this year, which will guarantee a place in the history books and a hugely lucrative future for his owner via the stud fees.
A few more mint juleps later, I already feel like an aficionado as racing terminology inexplicably starts rolling off my tongue. Before long, though, the sun is finally making its slow descent, leaving golden hues on a thronging crowd and putting paid to my fleeting flirtation with Kentucky’s finest. Well, there’s always next year.
Where to stay: The Brown Hotel in Louisville is listed on the national register of Historic Places, and has a great Derby tradition with flowing bowls of red roses filling the elegant reception. It’s home also to the Hot Brown, a delicious ham and cheese dish that’s served as the ultimate bite to eat after a night’s dancing. Rumour has it that Mr Brown’s ghost likes to stick around the 13th floor, and who can blame him, as the club lounge has tasty treats and drinks throughout the day from breakfast time. brownhotel.com

David Fitzsimons vs Peter Roberson
4 Nations Chess League, 2018
David Fitzsimons has become Ireland’s latest International Master. He secured his final IM norm with the following emphatic victory.
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5
David plays the French Defence with both colours, and lost with Black the following day to GM Gawain Jones, who preferred the more conservative 3.Nd2.
3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Be7 7.Be3 b6 8.Qd2 0–0 9.Nd1 a5 10.c3 a4 11.Bd3 Ba6 12.0–0 Nc6 13.f5
White has a space advantage in the centre and will play on the kingside, while Black will seek counterplay on the opposite wing.
13 . . . a3
Perhaps 13 . . . c4 followed by . . . a3 would give stronger counterplay, though I prefer White’s position in any event.
14.b3 cxd4 15.cxd4 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 Nb4 17.Qe2 exf5 18.Bd2 Nb8 19.Ne3 Qd7?
19 . . . g6 20.Nh4! gives very strong compensation for the pawn.
20.Nh4! Nc2 21.Nhxf5! Nxe3
21 . . . Nxa1 22.Qg4 g6 23.Nxe7+ Qxe7 24.Nxd5 wins.

Black shouldn’t have touched his kingside pawns, but White had a strong attacking position in any event.
30.Nxh6! gxh6 31.Rf6
Winning the queen and the game.

A former Franciscan monastery, Highlake House is a 160-year-old, two-storey, four-bedroom period residence, set on about 20 acres of elevated land in Ballinaheglish, Co Roscommon.
Currently on the market with Sherry FitzGerald P Burke in Roscommon for €545,000, the property offers a new owner a chance to acquire a unique country house with a number of potential business opportunities such as a boutique-style hotel, a guesthouse, retreat or a wedding venue.
For more than a century, the Franciscan monks kept the flame of learning and enlightenment alive in the community of Ballinaheglish, schooling local children in farming, horticulture and woodwork until the last ties with the order were severed in the late 1960s. The monastery, house, lands and a nearby school eventually closed and were put up for sale in the early 1970s.
The secluded and quiet surroundings of Highlake House are what drew the current owners, a Dutch couple, to make this property their home for the past 18 years. They have carried out extensive renovation works, including re-plumbing, re-wiring, roof re-slating, insulating and re-building an entire wing.
The main house incorporates a living and dining room with working fireplaces; a kitchen, pantry and laundry; a flower room and an office; four bedrooms including a master bedroom with bathroom and dressing room en suite; and one guest room en suite. One of the unique features of this property is the inclusion of a Great Hall as well as a tower room and tower bell room, which dates to the 1900s.
The Great Hall at present is in use as a private chapel. It features an altar which the current owner rescued from a bombed-out World War II church in Holland. The purpose and structure of this hall could easily be changed, as permission is in place. The accommodation also includes a 36 square metre private workshop/studio with a catwalk facing south into the formal inner yard.
The outbuildings include a detached single-storey building, currently used as a workshop and a store. This building has its own oil-fired boiler for central heating. A detached 116 square metre barn provides dry shelter for cars and trailers, while a semi-detached building features a boiler room, two store rooms and a stable.
The current owners also created a formal inner yard, as well as a landscaped garden/orchard with a teahouse.
An additional 6.7 acres could be acquired, located directly opposite the main entrance, with full planning permission for a four-bedroomed bungalow and garage.
Other features include a back-up generator for lights, central heating and fridges; two working tower-bells; an alarm system; remote controlled main gates; waste-bin collection; broadband internet and satellite TV.
The property is serviced by a choice of water supply – by a group-scheme and a well. Included with the sale are all curtains, most hanging lights (some antique) and many more items.

Cork food firm in €500k SuperValu deal

The Fresh Fish Deli, a west Cork food firm which was set up four years ago, has secured a €500,000 deal with SuperValu.
Based in Skibbereen, the firm was established by Monica Buckley, who uses fish supplied by local firms to make a range of fishcakes.
Buckley originally began supplying 40 SuperValu stores in Munster as part of Food Academy, a joint initiative between the retailer, Bord Bia and the Local Enterprise Offices that is designed to promote small food producers. Under the new deal, the fishcakes will be stocked nationwide.
The firm has moved to a 6,000 square foot production facility in Skibbereen to ramp up production, and Buckley has hired five new staff, bringing its total headcount to 20. She expects to add more jobs in the coming months.
“We were fortunate to be able to scale up our business in a sustainable fashion thanks to the SuperValu stores being independently-owned,” Buckley said. “We were able to grow sales before making a large capital investment to expand our facilities.”
Martin Kelleher, SuperValu’s managing director, said the fact that its stores stock products like Buckley’s that customers can’t buy anywhere else is “a massive unique selling point” that drives loyalty among shoppers.

Highlight: Mia Gallagher’s prose spans genres as well as decades: there is realism and surrealism, there are love stories, ghost stories and those stories which fit – poignantly, disturbingly – in-between

Short stories: Shift, By Mia Gallagher, New Island, €10.95
The author of 2007’s HellFire and 2016’s Beautiful Pictures of a Lost Homeland, Mia Gallagher has established herself as an experimental, highly inventive force in Irish fiction. Shift, a collection of short stories published over the last three decades, documents the evolution of this voice. A list printed at the back gives the publication dates of 12 of the 15 stories collected in this volume, appearing in anthologies, chapbooks and literary journals between the years 1990 and 2017.
Gallagher’s prose spans genres as well as decades: there are realism and surrealism, there are love stories, ghost stories and those stories which fit – poignantly, disturbingly – in-between. There are sentences which dazzle you in passing, verbal cornucopias embedded in plots which confront the strange and the sad and the uncomfortable.
Among the 15, Polyfilla, Found Wanting and the title story stand out, each one drawing upon themes of lust, longing and regret, but dancing along the borders of the sinister.
Polyfilla is told from the viewpoint of Sean, a heavy-drinking, casually chauvinist architect, whose brash behaviour at a dinner party leads to unexpectedly dangerous consequences.
Found Wanting, meanwhile, explores a more everyday plot: an affair between the married narrator and Johnny O, a musical frontman with black eyes, long limbs and a ludicrous black leather coat. Encountering him one day on Grafton Street, she is instantly fixated: “I remember the next four months as an infinite progression of vicious little moments, each lined up like a razor blade. Me hanging over them, suspended. Death by a thousand papercuts.”
Detailing their meetings in grimy backrooms, dark alleyways (“like a bad noir”) and, on one occasion, in a graveyard, Gallagher explores obsession in all its complexity, its alternating waves of self-awareness and self-delusion, despondency and romantic abandon. Her language is spontaneous, heady, unafraid. “We found more ways of touching,” she writes. “The weight of his eyes on me made me ill.”
The title story is especially striking: Des, an out-of-work driving instructor, takes an off-the-books job from a mysterious Italian woman and her son, Christo, a charismatic young man with depressive tendencies and a habit of dressing in women’s clothing. The bond which forms between Des and Christo would be enough to sustain a novel in itself; as it stands, their story is engrossing both as relationship narrative and as an exploration of Irish masculinity.
Pinning Tail On Donkey is also memorable, a short piece of speculative fiction set several generations in the future. Narrated by an unnamed elder who travelled to what was once Ireland from abroad, the story is told in its own gently alien lexicon, a kind of fictional register, like nadsat in A Clockwork Orange.
This world is a ‘technocracy’ of pronounced hierarchies, scarcity and wealth-worship; nature has withered away, and ‘corpocitizens’ are doomed to lives of zero-hour contracts and atomisation, having weathered a period referred to as ‘Heilige Angelendtheresela’s Outragesterity’. This colourless world has begotten its own morality, “the three-fold truth of blessed capital itself: the Trinity. Moral, Social and Holy Fiscal”.
Gallagher’s story evolves into a sinister allegory, meant for a world we are already beginning to experience. She writes: “We had been lured in by the gingerbread coating of the witch’s cottage, we had crouched in the cage, we had found our way out, and its name was want.”
The dystopia described in Pinning Tail On Donkey is provocative, richly detailed and convincingly grim, but its one flaw is that the language can occasionally feel excessive. The same happens with Lure, where the language is fluid and luscious, but where the author’s taste for opaque storytelling and indeterminate perspectives pose something of a challenge to the reader.
Too often, short stories are po-faced and rigidly conventional, preoccupied with nuance to the point of abandoning their plots and their readers. Gallagher is not one of those writers: there’s something very generous about Shift in its breadth of genre and language, containing not one but an apparently endless succession of ‘shifts’.
Gallagher is rightly confident enough in her talent to veer between genres and styles, employing language that is utterly mundane, and profane, as often as it is lyrical. The result is entertaining, dark, witty and constantly surprising, denying the reader even a moment to relax.

Decisions must be made on foeticide, say doctors

Highlight: Under the scheme published by the government, all babies must be delivered after they have reached viability at 23 or 24 weeks, whereas other countries do not have gestational limits in cases of fatal foetal abnormality
Body


Legislators need to consider whether to allow foeticide in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, leading doctors have said.
The doctors, who are heading up working groups on the provision of abortion services for the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG), said this was an issue that needed to be addressed as the existing scheme makes foeticide an offence in all circumstances.
Dr Keelin O’Donoghue, a consultant obstetrician and maternal-foetal medicine specialist, said doctors in other countries had faced legal actions for ‘wrongful birth’ when babies were born alive after attempted abortions, and lived or had active interventions to prolong life.
“I worry that we will be very exposed on this issue as the [general scheme that was published] does not allow for foeticide,” she said.
Under the scheme published by the government, all babies must be delivered after they have reached viability at 23 or 24 weeks, whereas other countries do not have gestational limits in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.
“Some of these babies could live longer than originally anticipated and that will create a lot of challenges for parents and for clinicians,” O’Donoghue said.
Dr Nóirín Russell, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said other countries allowed doctors - in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities - to give medication “to stop the baby’s heart [in utero] and ensure it is born sleeping. It is part of a compassionate delivery of care. The reality in my experience is that most parents make that choice [foeticide].”
In England, parents of unborn children with fatal foetal abnormalities can choose between delivery and comfort care or prior foeticide and induction. The vast majority choose the latter.
O’Donoghue said that was what most Irish parents had done if they decided to terminate a pregnancy with a fatal foetal abnormality.
“If there is consensus not to undertake this practice, and I understand why many would feel this way, we need to consider the consequences and explain them,” O’Donoghue said.
Both doctors expressed concern that the government was looking to rush the introduction of abortion services, before clear referral pathways had been established and adequately resourced.
“Portugal was the most recent country to legalise termination of pregnancy. It took them 18 months to establish the service and that was considered very fast,” Russell said.
Russell said doctors were seriously concerned at the prospect of additional litigation.
“We are already spending more on obstetric litigation than we are on obstetric care. All of this needs to be very carefully planned,” she said.
“We want to provide a good, safe and equitable service. We need to get it right,” O’Donoghue said.
Both expressed concern about existing waiting lists and the inability to access ultrasound to date a pregnancy or to scan for a foetal anomaly.

The Department of the Taoiseach does not have any records of minutes, notes, memos or emails of the weekly meetings of government policy and press advisers. Advisers to Fine Gael and independent ministers meet every week to discuss upcoming government business, the Dáil agenda, media appearances, to update each other on what’s happening in their departments, and other matters.
The meetings are convened by the Taoiseach’s senior staff and take place in Government Buildings but in response to a freedom of information request, the Department of the Taoiseach said that no records of minutes, notes, memos and emails about these meetings exist.
Cabinet ministers have two special advisers, one who covers the relevant policy area and the other who works on their minister’s media coverage and liaises with journalists. These are appointed by the ministers themselves, with most junior ministers also able to appoint one special adviser.
According to government sources, policy advisers usually meet on Mondays at around lunchtime in Government Buildings with the meetings chaired by the Taoiseach’s chief of staff Brian Murphy. At these meetings, advisers provide updates on what’s going on in their department that week, the Oireachtas schedule and the cabinet agenda.
A separate meeting of press advisers to ministers usually takes place on Tuesday afternoon where the same matters are discussed. But advisers also outline planned announcements by their ministers or departments and, according to the same sources, any freedom of information requests that the department may be about to release which could be the subject of media coverage.
The Sunday Business Post requested any records related to these meetings in April but was told in a response to this request that no records had been identified and nor is there any evidence that records of this nature ever existed.

Digicel bond falls as management attempts to reassure investors it can cut firm’s debts

A key Digicel bond fell to a fresh low last week, even as Denis O’Brien and the mobile phone company’s top management met investors to outline plans to reduce its debt mountain.
O’Brien and Digicel’s relatively new chief executive Alexander Matuschka Greiffenclau, and chief financial officer Ray Leclercq, have been meeting investors in New York, Boston, Miami and London in recent days on a so-called no-deal roadshow. They’ve been setting out how the company’s leverage will reduce in the coming years. The most immediate concern for Digicel is a $2 billion bond that must either be refinanced or repaid next year.
Although Digicel reiterated its guidance to its bondholders and lenders that earnings this year will come in at about $1 billion, the price of the key $2 billion bonds fell to as low as 74 cents in the dollar on Friday.
The bond had traded at par, or 100 cents, as recently as January. The more the bond price falls the higher the interest rate on it is.
[caption id="attachment_418139" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Denis O’Brien[/caption]
Digicel’s talks with investors have focused on explaining how its leverage will reduce in the coming years. It is understood that the company outlined that its earnings will climb, partly as it cuts investment on its network.
Bloomberg, the financial news agency, reported that it would also look at inorganic capital measures to cut down on its borrowings. The Sunday Business Post understands that this could involve the sale of some assets, such as mobile phone towers, and the sale and leaseback of some other assets, and it could also look at disposing of its operations in Panama.
Bond markets have turned sour on companies exposed to emerging market economies in recent months, which has led to the sell-off in Digicel debt.
That has been compounded by the fact that it has taken a number of years for Digicel to return to earnings growth, all of which will make refinancing the company’s debt expensive for O’Brien.
In an effort to slash its costs, Digicel last year announced a major round of redundancies, cutting about one-quarter of its staff and outsourcing some functions to Chinese firm ZTE.
Digicel also exited its sponsorship deal with the West Indies cricket team a year early, the deal was costing Digicel an estimated $5 million a year.
The company had plans to reduce its debt by floating on the New York Stock Exchange, but that plan was dropped at the last minute by O’Brien in 2015 ,with investors worried over the $10 billion flotation valuation.

Body


Hostel developer Ivan Dolan has been told to sit down with Irish Rail before applying for planning permission for a Dublin 2 tower block that the rail body says could compromise the plans for the €4.5 billion Dart Underground project.
Dolan, through a Maltese company called Rails Investments, has been attempting to get planning permission to build a seven-storey, 110,000 square foot office block near Pearse Street train station, on a site currently valued at €3.1 million.
His plan, however, has been opposed by Irish Rail, which said the Dart Underground plan – with a station at Pearse Street – would be “significantly compromised” by such a development.
The application was initially refused by Dublin City Council, before Dolan appealed to An Bord Pleanála.
Irish Rail argued in filings that “if this development advances before the construction of Dart Underground, the integrity of Dart Underground will be significantly compromised as it will preclude the future construction of a Dart Underground station beneath this site”.
It also noted concerns over “details in relation to ownership and responsibility”, since Rails Investment is registered in Malta.
According to a trove of documents from the so-called Paradise Papers leaks, which were made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Dolan is one of the shareholders in Rails Investments, along with a British businessman called Paul Robert Gostelow.
In its ruling last week – which upheld Dublin City Council’s refusal to grant planning permission – An Bord Pleanála’s planners’ report stated that it would be “appropriate, in my view, that the applicant [Dolan] and Iarnród Eireann be required to discuss and iron out all potential issues which could arise in respect of delivering both projects prior to any development consent being granted”.
The report said that it was “incumbent on both the applicant and Irish Rail to discuss and agree an acceptable resolution for the site that allows the development potential of the subject site, while at the same time provides comfort and satisfaction to Irish Rail that the proposal will in no way compromise the future construction at an underground station at this location”.
Dolan is also involved in the hostel business Clink Hostels, which was founded by his sisters Anne and Shelly.

Highlight: In a boost for booze industry lobbyists, abortion legislation will have first call on the Department of Health’s time and efforts 
Body


Delay, delay, delay. It’s one of the oldest tricks in the books for lobbyists trying to protect an industry.
The aim is to ward off proposed legislation for as long as possible, in the hope that circumstances will change.
All of this has happened with the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which has been languishing in Leinster House for the past six years. Successive ministers have promised and failed to get it into law.
It goes back even further than that. I remember interviewing Mícheál Martin when he was minister for health – in a pub in Cork, no less – back in 2004. He had just managed to get the smoking ban through and was going to take on the drinks industry with the first ever Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.
It never happened. And that has been no accident. Right up to the present day, the drinks industry has been using skilful and well-funded lobbyists, who have employed a variety of delaying tactics to stall the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.
Now these lobbyists have got an unexpected boost from the result of the Eighth Amendment referendum. There is a collective will in Leinster House to pass the abortion legislation before the end of the year.
The Department of Health has to steer through the abortion legislation and the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. Guess which one is going to lose out?
The longer the delay goes on, the better for the drinks industry. Its real fear is that Ireland will pass its first ever public health legislation on alcohol abuse and be hailed as an example to the rest of the world. It happened with the smoking ban. A story about the ‘drunken Irish’ cutting back on their Guinness would have huge appeal for the international media.
So what will the bill do? Minimum prices for alcohol will stop certain drinks being sold in shops for less than the price of a litre of milk. Alcohol ads will be banned from buses, trains, bus stops and stations, as well as from within 200 metres of schools and playgrounds.
Alcohol ads on television will appear only after the 9pm watershed, and in cinemas if the film has an over-18s rating. There will also be warnings on every drinks bottle about alcohol’s role in causing cancer.
The drinks industry representatives have been arguing that alcohol is no more carcinogenic than burnt toast. This laughable argument has been rightly dismissed by the Irish Cancer Society.
Another tactic of the global drinks companies is to use small operators to push their case, so that they can pretend to be David rather than Goliath.
They are arguing that putting cancer warnings on alcohol bottles will drive plucky micro-breweries - the Davids - out of business. But, as the Alcohol Action Ireland charity has pointed out, the real beneficiary will be the major distilleries – the Goliaths - which produce 99 per cent of alcohol here.
Similarly, the drinks industry successfully used small shops as a front to water down the bill’s restrictions on the display of alcohol. The real winners were the big supermarkets, which also had their restrictions on the display of alcohol relaxed.
Another tactic of the drinks industry is to fund ‘independent’ organisations to promote ‘responsible drinking’. They usually suggest that it is up to the individual to control their own drinking – and that everything can be solved by ‘education’ rather than government interventions.
The closest equivalent here is an organisation called Drink Aware, which is funded by drinks companies such as Diageo and major retailers which make money on alcohol sales.
Drink Aware told me that it was a fully independent organisation which was “supportive” of the current bill. So I decided to carry out a little test. Did it support all of the provisions in the bill, including minimum unit pricing, bans on alcohol advertising near schools, and restrictions on the display of alcohol in shops? It was unable to do so. That tells you all you need to know about its independence from the drinks industry.
The latest roadblock for the public alcohol bill is that other EU countries, no doubt at the behest of the very same multinational drinks companies, have objected to the bill’s provision of cancer warnings on alcohol bottles. The government has paused the bill’s progress yet again to await the outcome of this.
But as Alcohol Action Ireland has pointed out, there is nothing to stop the bill from proceeding through committee stage in the Dáil, given that the European Commission is expected to dismiss the latest spurious objections. Then it can be quickly enacted.
There have been some vocal supporters of the bill such as Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall and independent Senator Frances Black, who has spoken publicly about overcoming her battle with alcoholism.
Given his previous experience in Health, Micheál Martin is also backing it strongly. But the power rests with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his Minister for Health Simon Harris to enact a bill that could have the same public health impact as the smoking ban.
If this bill is made law, there will be no cheering crowds in Dublin Castle. But after years of it being allowed to interfere with the political system and, indeed, with the nation’s health, it is time that someone put the drinks industry back in its box.

Finnegan Menton has brought Woodville, a purpose-built student accommodation block, to market at 52/54 Botanic Avenue in Drumcondra, Dublin 9 for which it is quoting €1.95 million.
The property generated a gross income of €163,840 last year, which is expected to increase to €177,780 by the end of this year. Tenants currently pay €150 per week per bed space.
The property is laid out as five two-bedroom student apartments (with 23 bed spaces) at 52 Botanic Avenue and a separate, but adjoining, two-bedroom town house at 54 Botanic Avenue, which currently has five bed spaces.
Collectively, the overall floor area is about 420 square metres. The average student dwelling unit is 70 square metres. All units are currently let to students from DCU and there’s off-street parking for two cars with the property.
DCU, on the former St Patrick’s College Campus in Drumcondra, is less than a ten-minute walk from the property and the property is currently fully let for the 2018 academic year. It is also fully booked for short-term summer lettings to overseas students.
It is conveniently located on Botanic Avenue, which runs parallel to Griffith Park and the River Tolka and extends from Drumcondra Road Lower to Glasnevin Hill and St Mobhi Road.
The avenue is convenient to a host of local amenities including shops, restaurants, primary and secondary schools, third-level colleges, Griffith Park and the Botanic Gardens. The area is well served by a regular bus service and is within walking distance of Drumcondra Rail Station and convenient to the M50, M1 and Dublin Airport.
The agent’s quoting price of €1.95 million would provide a gross yield of about 8.4 percent (2017), and would be expected to increase to 9.1 percent in 2018.
Each student apartment unit comprises an entrance hall, living room, kitchen, bathroom, two bedrooms and an en suite bathroom. The property is fully furnished and all the contents are included in sale.
There is rear lane access to the property.
More details are available from the agent at 01-6147900.

Dry &#38; Fly hair firm hopes to Swaye investors as it seeks to raise €500,000 for its new app

The founders of the hair studio business Dry & Fly are seeking to raise €500,000 for a new app, Swaye, which connects marketers and social media influencers.
Andrew O’Neill and Geoff Walker, together with London-based Lisa Boissel, have already launched the app in London and Dublin.
“As business owners, we had frustrations with how we interact and engage with social media influencer marketing and found that it was labour intensive and fragmented,” O’Neill said.
“We built the app over the past year to create a new online marketplace for brands and influencers that want to have a more seamless connection.”
More than 200 businesses, including restaurant and nightclub company Hakkasan Group, the NED Hotel in London, and online retail giant Pretty Little Thing, have signed up for the app.
To date, Swaye has been self-funded, but now the company is seeking its first round of funding to expand internationally.
It aims to raise the funding within the next three months.
It plans to use €300,000 of the first-round funding from equity investors to expand the app in the Middle East, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Brazil.
The remaining €200,000 will be spent on growing the team in the areas of sales, customer service and development.
Influencers can sign up to the platform for free, but businesses are charged a subscription fee of €99 per month per location. The pair are forecasting revenues of €3.6 million in Swaye’s first year.
O’Neill and Walker have just launched a third location for Dry & Fly.
There are two of the blow dry and beauty studios in Dublin already and a third just opened in House of Fraser in Dundrum as a pop-up. O’Neill said it would gauge interest there before opening up permanently.

Acknowledge Our Reality
The past referendum pointed to a lot of important matters directly related to what was happening around it. As with every political action, however, there were unexpected learnings along the way that we, as a people, can use.
Ireland was not short of posters these past few weeks. Every lamppost was covered in them, and, particularly relevant for a non-election, most of them ceased to serve a purpose as of 10pm on Friday, May 25, when polls closed.
The thing is, all the data pointed to them not serving a purpose long before that. Voters on both sides were borderline unanimous in acknowledging that posters had little effect, not just in their voting intention, but in their awareness in general about the referendum.
Even three years ago, it’s hard to have imagined that being a valid argument, but the breadth of engagement across the web in this country has changed. We have an opportunity to use this great tool of learning to do something better for the environment.
There will always be some purpose for paper — this very piece is being read by most of you in paper form. The green bins you put it in keep that circle going. It’s far harder to achieve that same level with political posters and, more importantly, the downside of reducing paper usage for those in politics is minimal.
The posters should all be down by the time you read this, but it’s safe to say plenty will still be up. Many will have been disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner, but every single one that isn’t is a missed opportunity.
Social media, regular media and the doorstep have proven to be far greater means of reaching voters and engaging with them on even a base level. Posters have ceased to matter; now they only pollute our views and our life.
Most people know at least one person involved in politics and many readers of Connected are actively participants. This month, as the summer weather finally hits our land, I ask you to talk with those you know about posters.
Don’t merely say to them that it’s bad for the environment. Engage with them, talk with them and offer to help them find an alternative if you can.
This is an issue that holds no political cleavage. Whoever you vote for, this is an issue they can stand for without fearing going against how it chimes with the rest of their beliefs. It’s about as safe an issue as it gets.
We have seen every kind of engagement in this country over the past few weeks. We know that people will listen when they are spoken to and treated as people, not merely voters. Right now, most politicians fear avoiding posters because they feel they will miss out against rivals.
Make them know that by ditching posters, they are winning the love of those who want a cleaner and more digital form of campaigning in Ireland.

Energy software company GridBeyond plans to double workforce to 80

The energy management tech company GridBeyond plans to double its workforce over the next three years.
Previously known as Endeco, the company was founded by Michael Phelan. It has designed software that automatically balances the grid, the network that delivers electricity from producers to consumers, by turning power on and off in very short increments which allows for greater use of renewable technologies.
“Renewables, by their very nature, aren’t there all the time. They need flexibility,” Phelan said.
The company has 40 employees and this will increase to 80 by 2021. These will be mainly Irish-based jobs. The company’s clients are mainly in Ireland and Britain.
“There are definitely new markets opening up across Europe and the US so we will be looking at those,” Phelan said.
GridBeyond has raised €7 million to date, but it is likely to raise more to launch in other markets.
“If we want to go fairly quickly into the next set of markets, which we may well do because the market is expanding, we will need to look at investment,” he said. “In many of these tech areas, they move very quickly, so if you want to expand, you can’t wait to do it out of profits. You have to push on.”
GridBeyond’s investors include Dublin Business Innovation Centre/AIB Seed Capital Fund, ACT Venture Capital, ESB NovusModus by ESB Innovation and private investors. It has an office in Watford in Hertfordshire. However, it exports a lot from Ireland, so that might cause issues post-Brexit.
“We will have to see what barriers, if any, are put in front of us as we go forward and find an efficient way around those,” Phelan said.

EY report: INM should ‘consider’ Citywest closure

Highlight: Consultants said it should outsource its printing to rival Irish Times and save up to €3m a year; EY added media giant had a ‘can’t-do mentality’ 
Body


A report by consulting firm EY into Ireland’s biggest newspaper publisher, Independent News & Media, has said the company should “consider” closing its printing plant in Citywest and outsourcing this activity to its rival the Irish Times.
The report also criticises the culture in INM, concluding that its teams “operate in silos with limited cooperation”.
The consultants also express concerns that INM has a “can’t-do mentality” which focuses on “risks and hurdles” rather than opportunities. It said that it was “difficult” to hold employees to account as there was “limited measurement of results”.
EY said INM needed to change, and that its teams should work interdepartmentally and work towards joint goals. Targets, it said, should be data-driven with a focus on its customers and the external environment.
A “can-do mentality” was needed with each department “held accountable” for its contribution to the company’s overall profitability and balance sheet.
In order to “future-proof” INM, EY has set out four initiatives to “protect and reinforce the core”. This included maximising income from refocused and revamped print products at “increased prices”, which could be worth between €2 million and €4 million.
More page views of its news websites could add between €4 million and €11 million in revenues. Cost-saving initiatives could add between €5 million and €7 million, while consolidating its print distribution business would add about €4 million.
EY said INM needed to build a “hyper-local” business in communities of between 25,000 and 200,000 people. In the short term, this could be worth between €5 million and €10 million, rising to €100 million in the long term.
It said INM should build dominatable niches that could be “rolled out” across English-speaking communities worldwide, in a venture that could grow to being worth hundreds of millions per annum to the business over a number of years.
Acquiring or developing business-to-business and business-to-consumer verticals could also be worth up to €100 million to INM in the long term. Introducing a “paid-for content” scheme targeting the most loyal users could be worth between €40 million and €70 million per annum.
EY said a survey of consumers found that 31 per cent of respondents would be willing to pay for online news. Among the tactics EY believes that INM should pursue is to consider closing Citywest and outsourcing printing to its longtime rival the Irish Times.
It said this could be worth €2 million and €3 million per annum to the company, but would require investment of between €6 million and €8 million. Doing procurement projects and business process outsourcing could be worth up to €2 million, it said.
Last Friday, the High Court ruled against INM’s application to have the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement’s decision to apply to the High Court to appoint inspectors to the company overturned.
INM declined to comment on the EY report, or on the cost of its High Court application.
Michael Doorly, the chief executive of INM, has ordered staff not to delete or destroy documents or communications that could be “potentially relevant” to an investigation by the ODCE into the media group.
Doorly said INM had “already suspended all ‘relevant’ routine data or document destruction policies and we are preserving all potentially relevant data on our IT systems”. Doorly’s instruction to staff on Friday comes 69 days after INM received an affidavit from the ODCE setting out its serious concerns about the company including the alleged access by a third party of journalists’ and others’ data.
INM declined to comment on specific individuals who have left the company since it received the ODCE affidavit on March 23 and whether it had taken steps to secure their hard drives, emails and mobile phones prior to their departure.
Doorly has told staff not to delete or destroy not just data, but also to retain emails, text messages, instant messages, USB sticks, hand written notes and documents.
He said it would be “unfair” to expect staff to know what might be relevant: “So to make it easy – please do not destroy anything until I lift this temporary ban.” Over two days in late February, INM destroyed a large amount of data at the centre of the ODCE investigation prior to it receiving the state watchdog’s affidavit.
INM claimed in an affidavit that the data was destroyed for “general housekeeping” purposes ahead of GDPR.

FF property tax relief proposal smacked down

Highlight: Government chooses not to support review that would ease financial burden on apartment owners 
Body


The government has ruled out a reduction in property tax for apartment owners paying management fees of up to €2,000.
There are over 200,000 apartments in the country, with the majority attracting management fees to cover the costs of services such as public lighting, grass cutting and bin collection.
Fianna Fáil had been seeking some relief for these householders in the current property tax review, given that homeowners in private housing estates usually have their grass cutting and public lighting paid for by the local council.
But the government’s position is that apartment owners knew about the prospect of lifelong management fees when they were buying their properties.
Minister of State for Finance Michael D’Arcy told the Seanad last week that apartment owners were also paying their management fees for services such as bin collections, common area maintenance and building repairs.
“These are costs which homeowners in many other developments would have to fund themselves for their own properties. An exemption for apartment dwellers as suggested would, therefore, be unfair,” he said.
However, the Seanad did pass the Fianna Fáil motion calling for some relief to those paying high management fees.
This includes some homeowners in private estates who also have to pay management fees for services.
According to the Daft.ie website, the management fees for the Ardoyne Mews apartment complex in Ballsbridge in Dublin are €2,300 annually.
The annual fees in the Grange End apartment complex in Dunshauglin in Meath are €1,350 while they are €575 per year in the Welwyn Road estate in Douglas in Cork city.
Fianna Fáil Senator Gerry Horkan said that many owners had no choice but to buy properties with management fees because it was the ‘only show in town’ at the time. He said that the fact they were paying for services such as grass cutting and public lighting should be taken account of in their property tax bills.
“We’re not saying that it should be written off, but maybe 10 or 20 per cent of it,” he said.
The government is due to receive the final report of a review into the property tax by Professor Don Thornhill over the summer months.
Property tax rates have been frozen since 2013, but in the meantime, house prices have increased substantially.
This means that property taxes are due to rise substantially in 2020 when houses are revalued again.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said he will announce changes in the forthcoming budget to ensure that property taxes remain ‘affordable’ beyond 2020.

Ismaël’s Ghosts: Directed by Arnaud Desplechin, Selected, 15A, Rating: **
My Friend Dahmer: Directed by Marc Meyers, Nationwide, 15A, Rating: **
If Marvel can do it, why not a French auteur? Welcome to the Desplechin Cinematic Universe: an interlocking chain of seven films from twinkling Gallic trickster Arnaud Desplechin, in which Mathieu Amalric plays a variation on the same character – a skinny, shabby charmer bug-eyed with excited energy and haunted by the women who have passed through his life.
It’s their seventh collaboration, and this time Amalric is Ismaël Vuillard (as he was in Desplechin’s Kings and Queen), except now he’s a woebegone film director hard at work on a 1960s spy thriller. Ismaël has never got over the disappearance, 21 years before, of his beloved wife Carlotta Bloom (Marion Cotillard), who walked out of his life without a backward glance, never to be heard of again. Now she’s back. Or is she?
Just like a superhero franchise, Ismaël’s Ghosts benefits from, but doesn’t require, some familiarity with Desplechin’s universe; where characters have the same faces and the same names, live in the same places and go through the same experiences, but are otherwise completely different.
It would also be helpful to have seen Hitchcock’s Vertigo and Fellini’s 8½, because elements of those two confessionals are blended into the piquant mix, alongside a few other references – from James Joyce to James Bond - best discovered for yourself. This is a film that immerses us into the giddy headspace of a restless, undisciplined man who cannot sleep or eat, who drinks and smokes too much, who has no temperament, no mute button and nothing to secure him to the earth. It is, perhaps unsurprisingly, itself restless and undisciplined and unhinged.
Layered into the Martin Guerre plot are Ismaël’s memories and fantasies, alongside lengthy sequences taken from his ongoing film project: a garrulous globe-hopping thriller about a French espionage agent named Ivan Dédalus (Louis Garrel), who we discover is a fictionalised version of Ismaël’s estranged younger brother.
Complicating the psychodrama further still is Ismaël’s shy astrophysicist girlfriend Sylvia (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is relaxing on the sand at his beachside home when his long-lost wife walks up and asks where her husband is. Carlotta, named after one of the spirits haunting Vertigo, moves in. Without much in the way of small talk about where she’s been for two decades, she looks to pick things up where she left off. And with that, everyone is finally estranged from everyone else. Job done, Ismaël, Sylvia, his spy film, their life together and everything else you’ve been watching for an hour grind to a halt to better concentrate on the mystery of Carlotta’s return.
Like much of Desplechin’s work, Ismaël’s Ghosts feels intensely personal without being specifically autobiographical (or at least, I hope it isn’t, since at one point Ismaël shoots his producer in the arm). But whatever his sources, the film is a bit of a drag; confusing when it should be coherent, loud when it should be quiet, indulgent when it should be generous.
Requiring considerable forbearance from his audience, Desplechin races through shifts in tone and time, realities and fictions, memories and dreams, alternating between furniture-smashing rage at the tragic injustices of life and frankly daft moments when you suspect you might be watching a comedy. Flinging everything at the screen takes courage, but Desplechin can’t make enough of it stick.
[caption id="attachment_417681" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Ross Lynch in My Friend Dahmer[/caption]
Still, you’d be craving a dash of Desplechin’s madcap energy when watching first-time writer and director Marc Meyer’s monotonous My Friend Dahmer, a dull, odd portrait of the infamous serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer’s final year of high school in 1975, the period just prior to his first murder.
Dahmer would go on to kill 17 men and boys in 20 years. He was caught, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992. Two years later, he would die at the hands of another inmate. The film leaves all that information to title cards over the end credits, perhaps because audiences who didn’t know who he was and what he did might wonder why anyone would find the awkward adolescence of a morbid, humourless teenager interesting.
Take the mop-haired Dahmer (Ross Lynch) out of it, and the film is indistinguishable from countless angsty young adult melodramas, hitting every marker for the genre in predictable sequence: an ulcerative school experience, self-absorbed parents, sexual confusion and an obsession with death.
Abandoning the subjective perspective of its source, a true-life graphic novel by John ‘Derf’ Backderf – one of Dahmer’s classmates at Revere High School in Ohio (and played here by Alex Wolff), “Jeff” is your typical boy next door, living with his unstable mother (Anne Heche) and long-suffering father (Dallas Roberts). His friendships are shallow, he is bullied at every turn, and there’s something bubbling in his brain. When not walking stiffly down school corridors, he’s alone in the garden shed dissecting roadkill.
It’s certainly creepy, but in reframing Dahmer’s formation as a flat, self-aware teen movie – more Wes Anderson than Wes Craven - Meyer abandons the subjective perspective of his source, and lacks the purpose to find a new one.

French lessons: Kate Mosse

Length: 822 words
Byline: Anna Carey
Highlight: Like all her other books, Kate Mosse’s latest novel The Burning Chambers is steeped in lore and history - and this time she’s training her sights on 16th-century France, writes Anna Carey 
Body


Kate Mosse’s new book The Burning Chambers is set in the Languedoc region of southern France, but its origins lie in a surprisingly faraway place. “As always with me,” she says, “the stories come out of the landscape and the history.”
Mosse has spent a lot of time in Languedoc, where she has had a house for nearly 30 years and which is also the setting of her multimillion-selling Languedoc trilogy (which began with Labyrinth in 2005). But in the case of The Burning Chambers, the inspirational landscape was that of South Africa, where Mosse was attending a literary festival back in 2012.
“I went to a tiny, lovely little town called Franschhoek, 30km east of Cape Town,” she says. “As I was being driven into the town, I saw a sign that said ‘Languedoc’. As we got closer into town, I noticed that all the names of the big wine farmers were French.”
She soon discovered that the town - its name means French Corner in Dutch - had been founded by Huguenot refugees who had fled from southern France to Amsterdam. They were persuaded by the Dutch government to use the wine-producing skills of their native land to create the South African wine industry in the 17th century.
“I went back and thought: ‘Hello, Carcassonne, what is the Huguenot history of this area?’ ” she says. “And there was huge history there and, of course, there was a very rich history in Toulouse. And so, the minute I knew there was something to say and a story to tell, I was back. And it’s been absolutely joyous.”
The result was The Burning Chambers, the first in a planned trilogy that will follow the feud between a Catholic family and a Huguenot family over several centuries. Set in Toulouse and Carcassonne during the bloody religious wars of the 16th century, it tells the story of Minou, a Catholic bookseller’s daughter from Carcassonne, who meets Piet Reydon, a charismatic Huguenot. As religious tension rises, Minou discovers she is also being pursued by an unknown enemy whose actions will threaten her entire family.
What is it about that part of France that captures Mosse’s imagination? “I think it’s a green land soaked red,” she says. “The history of all the conflicts, which are almost all religious wars, is everywhere. There’s the enormous beauty . . . but everywhere you’re aware of the history of the place.
“Wherever you walk in Carcassonne, you feel the whisper of the past. I think you feel that in Toulouse as well. Even walking in the hills, you feel you’re in an ancient place. It’s the ghost in the landscape.
“Although my characters are imagined people, they’re people who might have lived, and that’s what I feel when I’m there and that’s where my stories come from.”
That history can seem all too relevant today, as Mosse is well aware. “We are all at the mercy of history,” she says. “These [religious wars] weren’t about faith, they were about power and control and influence, between leading Huguenots and what we’d now call very right-wing Catholics, [fighting] for influence over King Charles IX, who was a minor . . . That’s why it finally kicked off into war. I’m careful not to make any modern parallels, but it’s impossible not to, because we never learn. It’s always a small number of men – kings, generals, popes - making decisions that destroy lives.”
Unsurprisingly, as the co-founder and spokeswoman of the Women’s Prize for Fiction (formerly the Orange Prize), Mosse is always interested in telling women’s stories. “Women don’t appear in the history books because they weren’t in charge, mostly,” she says “What I’m trying to do is tell women’s stories. How did women behave? They’re never in the edicts, never in pictures of people signing bits of paper that will send hundreds and thousands of people to their deaths, but actually it’s the women who keep families going because the men were away at war.”
And Mosse loves finding out about their lives. “I have two types of research, my head research, in books, and my foot research,” she says. “That means boots on the ground, timing myself walking one end of the city to the other. Climbing up mountains, looking at the land, being in Franschhoek, Toulouse, Amsterdam. I know that that physical research is as important as book research.”
If you write about the past, she says, you can’t just regurgitate historical facts. It has to feel right. “The importance of research is to feed the story, give it texture. I don’t need to know how wide women’s skirts in 1562 were as a fact, I need to know so that when Minou runs from soldiers, can she get through the door?”
The best historical novels evoke what it was like to be a person in another century. “Circumstances change completely, the expectations and realities of people’s lives of course are different,” says Mosse. “But the human heart doesn’t change, not really. The emotions are the same. And my job as a novelist is to capture the emotional reality.”
The Burning Chambers is published by Mantle, priced €22.80

Future looks rosy as international retailers eagerly eye Irish market

Length: 592 words
Byline: Graham Clifford
Highlight: We, unlike many of our European neighbours, have a growing population with a relatively high level of disposable income
Body


In the boardrooms of many international retail businesses across the world, Ireland is being discussed with some excitement.
Why? Because we, unlike many of our European neighbours, have a growing population with a relatively high level of disposable income - as Fergal O’Brien, director of policy and chief economist with Ibec, explains.
“The Irish retail market is considered a hugely attractive one in which to invest," he says.
“Perhaps even one of the best such markets in the world, as we have very high-income consumers.
“In addition, while the growth of populations in other developed nations are stagnating, the Irish population is predicted to grow by between 30 and 40 per cent over the next three decades. It's little wonder that there’s such investment in the sector by indigenous business owners now and such interest from international investors looking to the future.”
And while there could be much change to our retail sector in years to come, it's worth noting the significant transformation which has taken place over the last decade or so.
“The economic recovery in Ireland was led by incredible growth from the export sector, especially in the years 2012 to 2014. But retail was not getting the same buoyancy as other sectors. GDP was increasing, but retail growth was stubbornly lower. And one of the reasons for that is a change in the purchasing habits of consumers,” said O’Brien.
“More money is being spent on services than on goods, so there’s been a big boost for the travel industry and all hospitality-based experiences. That’s a serious structural change, which retailers need to adapt to.”
While the volume of sales might be increasing, the benefit to the retailer is not what it was. Comparatively lower prices than before the downturn, coupled with increasing operating costs, have transformed the business models which retailers had become accustomed to.
Indeed, this is what O’Brien refers to as “the sweet spot for consumers”, through a combination of zero inflation and growing personal earnings.
But why, when the recovery started to take hold in Ireland, did retail numbers not simply follow suit?
“You have to remember that there was, and is, an element of ‘keeping down with the Joneses’ -that is, not buying goods and large items because others are not buying them also. But retail cycles pass and, ultimately, consumers will return to fundamentals.”
O’Brien believes the transformation of the retail sector can see more growth for those retailers outside of the main urban centres which choose to embrace change.
“Because of the growth of online shopping, the reality is that the local retailer is now competing with international retailers," he says.
“During the downturn, the more traditional retail sectors in regional towns across Ireland took a hit, and many have struggled to turn their businesses around. Even factors such as the improved road network made it easier for consumers to travel to out-of-town shopping malls, and so the high street retailers suffered.
“But this transformation offers great opportunities for Irish retailers if they also work on their online offering. And because of the nature of online retail, it's less essential to be based in a major town or city.
“These are very exciting times for Irish retail, and if there is a concentration on upskilling and developing more non-traditional modes of sale and delivery, then all will benefit.
“Of course, there will also be increased competition with international retailers wanting to get in on the action, but that’s the sign of a vibrant economy.”

Futuristic fable is a fine idea badly done

Body


Fiction: The Biggerers, By Amy Lilwall , Point Blank, €19.55
The year is 2116 and, in London, illness is pretty much a thing of the past. People can be “cured of anything, vaccinated against anything, brought back to life within hours of dying, have any body part replaced”. You might think this utopia of wellness would lead to a much happier society, but you’d be wrong.
The full-sized inhabitants of Amy Lilwall’s debut novel have become more insular and self-absorbed than ever before.
Nobody really knows their neighbours any more and nobody procreates. In order to try to engender a more loving society, a company called Billbridge & Minxus has come up with a solution in the shape of Littlers, foot-high mini-humans who live in the house: their mission, “breeding empathy back into what was becoming a dangerously individualist society”.
Treated somewhere between pets and children, these Littlers live in baskets, get fed with generic ‘flakes’ and are genetically engineered to be able to talk to each other, but not to their adopters. They’re extremely loving, both to other Littlers and to their ‘owners’, the Biggerers of the title, and they display signs of intelligence, but they struggle with memory loss, where chunks of their past seem deliberately obscured.
Two of these Littlers, Jinx and Bon Bon, live in suburban happiness with Susan and Hamish, whose own relationship has hit a kind of plateau. Susan seems perpetually on the verge of leaving psychologist Hamish, while he’s unnaturally distracted by one of his patients, Emma, who’s confiding in him about the less-than-ethical nature of her work in a scientific laboratory: can you feel the plot thickening?
Jinx and Bon Bon are clearly loved, although the absent-minded humans sometimes forget to feed them or to clothe them in their ‘hum coats’ when the weather turns chilly – most of the time the Littlers walk around naked – exacerbated when the Littler from next door, Blankey, shows off her brand new coat. Things aren’t as bad for them, however, as their friend, Chips, from two doors down, whose mentally ill owner has really started to neglect him, so that he’s getting dangerously thin and his house is filthy to the point of being uninhabitable.
All four are part of the latest Batch 20 Littlers, the most advanced mini-humans ever created, and they’re starting to realise that perhaps they’re not only similar to their full-sized housemates, they’re exactly the same, only smaller.
Intertwined with this story of the Litters’ awakening consciousness is the tale of a guilt-ridden scientist, Drew, who steals a test foetus from the laboratory, brings it home, and brings it to full term in the shape of the tiny Isabel. Drew and his partner Watty ‘adopt’ Isabel as their daughter, hiding her away from the rest of the world, for fear of the moral and scientific scandal that would ensue if she were to ‘come out’.
The Biggerers is a fine idea, poorly executed. It takes far too long for the story to develop. For the disorientating first 72 pages, it’s hard to figure out exactly what’s going on. This is probably a deliberate ploy to entice you into this futuristic fantasy, but Lilwall commits the cardinal sin, in that we don’t really care enough for her characters to want to wade through all the extraneous waffle.
Clocking in at over 500 pages, The Biggerers is also far too long, and this reader had lost interest in the fates of the four Littlers and their humans ages and pages before the final chapter. It’s a pity, because there’s the kernel of an interesting story here, involving contentious topics like genetic manipulation, cloning and the gradual isolationism pervading modern society.
With some judicious editing, The Biggerers could have become a super-smart sci-fi thriller and a sideways snipe at our tech-absorbed society; instead it feels like a slog.

Got a property problem? Don’t worry, we have a bill for that

Highlight: Rather than create cross-party support for one well-considered piece of legislation, Dáil members compete for the limelight and miss out on vital elements because they can’t be seen to be in favour of something they didn’t think up themselves
Body


When it comes to housing, there are more bills floating around the Dáil than the ducks in your local pond. It doesn’t bode well for progress because nobody can be sure what TDs are arguing about at any given time.
It seems bills are the new pills: whatever the problem, we have a bill for it.
Rather than create cross-party support for one well-considered piece of legislation, Dáil members compete for the limelight and miss out on vital elements because they can’t be seen to be in favour of something they didn’t think up themselves.
Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy said he wants legislation to be introduced before the summer break. His idea is to make it criminal to raise rents beyond 4 per cent in rent pressure zones (RPZ) and bring in fines of up to €15,000 for anyone who fails to comply. That’s because, thus far, official statistics have shown what the academic literature predicted – that rent controls wouldn’t work or would cause distortions – has happened.
When a bad policy doesn’t work, the solution in Irish politics is to double down and assume that ‘stupid + stupid = sensible’. Now ask yourself: “why would we make a law half way through 2018 that will only last until 2019?” Don’t forget rent pressure zones were supposed to last only until 2019.
The reality is rent pressure zones won’t be ending. They are too convenient and economical because the government gets a politically popular result based on a general dislike of the landlord collective.
Fianna Fáil housing spokesperson Darragh O’Brien criticised Murphy’s idea and in turn was himself criticised, with Murphy accusing Fianna Fáil of having “broken the housing market when they were in power”.
Strictly speaking, that’s not true – Fianna Fáil broke the whole damn economy. But the party did deliver an oversupply of housing. It did so in the most catastrophic manner possible. But we didn’t have housing shortages when Fianna Fáil was in power.
Meanwhile, greedy landlords are getting better rents than the good ones who didn’t raise rents in the past.
Spare a thought for the landlord who didn’t raise the rent in the past and is now locked into a below-market rent? Nope, no need. After all, a landlord is a landlord and that means s/he doesn’t deserve fair taxation (already done), or pity, or a chance to capture rising prices (rent control gives price fixing on the way up and doesn’t stop falls on the way down).
Into this soup, add all the competing bills. There’s the Social Democrats’ tenancy bill, for example, which looks to increase notice times on Section 34 lease terminations. This doesn’t stop terminations, it just means it takes longer for the break to occur, similar to the way we designed Irish divorce legislation.
No housing spokesperson in any party has actually come out and stated the obvious: if people would just sign up to longer fixed-term tenancies this wouldn’t be a problem. But that won’t happen either, because it would mean that the tenant gives up the right to walk away at short notice when it suits them.
One of the three ‘F’s that were so hard fought for in the Land League days was ‘fixity of tenure’ and that became real when you signed longer leases and didn’t miss payments.
That’s still the case today, but for law makers and lobbyists on all sides (including many in the charitable sectors) the belief is that inside every renter there is a closet owner dying to get out.
So we don’t look at the obvious solution of long-term leases. Long-term leases offer long-term tenure, so why not promote them?
The Dáil running order for May 29 had the following entries in the running order:
Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill 2017 [Seanad] – Second Stage.
Residential Tenancies (Student Rents, Rights and Protections) Bill 2018 – Second Stage
– Eoin Ó Broin, Kathleen Funchion.
Rent Transparency Bill 2017 – Second Stage – Noel Rock.
Residential Tenancies (Rent pressure zones & Student Accommodation) (Amendment) Bill 2018 – Second Stage – Darragh O’Brien.
Residential Tenancies (Residential Tenancies Board) (Amendment) Bill 2018 – Second Stage – Barry Cowen.
On the back of these bills there are countless pages that almost nobody will bother to read. Is it any wonder that with the sheer number of proposals for significant change that the default mindset of anybody involved in Irish property is one of abject confusion?
Show me a person who tells you they know what is going on and I’ll show you a liar or a fool. The only thing I know for sure is that when it comes to housing, we have a bill for every ill and, still, a very sick sector.

Greencore is top pick for ‘short sellers’ banking on further falls

Greencore, the Dublin-headquartered food company, has emerged as the share targeted most by short sellers who are betting its price will fall further, according to a new report by an influential broker.
In its annual ‘Get Shorty’ list of London Stock Exchange-quoted firms which investors have fallen out of love with in the past 12 months, Canaccord Genuity said Greencore topped the list with 15.3 per cent of its shares out on loan to investors who are short on the stock. Short sellers make profits by borrowing shares in a company and selling them in a bid to force the price down before acquiring them at a lower price and pocketing the difference.
Greencore shares slumped in March after the company issued a profit warning because of losses run up by its legacy investments in the US. Although the share price has recovered somewhat since then, some investors still have concerns about the strategy embarked on by chief executive Patrick Coveney.
Last year, the most-shorted stock on the Canaccord list was Carillion, the construction and outsourcing services provider that had 27 per cent of its stock sold short.
In early January, Carillion collapsed after it failed to reach an agreement to reduce its debts and a string of profit warnings.
“Which underlines the point that this isn’t some whimsical measure – the short interest on a company is often a reliable red flag of a company’s underlying structural issues. And, of course, it doesn’t necessarily mean the company will go bust – but it could mean the dividend is under threat, so an important consideration for investors,” said Simon McGarry, senior equity research analyst at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management.
In May, Greencore told shareholders that it was expecting good strong growth in the coming months and its cash generation continued to strengthen.
The list of stocks contains some of the best-known firms in Britain, including Marks & Spencer, the iconic retailer that is struggling to compete against the twin forces of the shift to online sales and changing fashion.
Also on the list are department store Debenhams, grocer J Sainsbury, breakdown service the AA and door-to-door lender Provident Financial.

Hall says Donohoe failed to protect taxpayers on Anglo bill

Body


Debtors’ rights campaigner David Hall has accused Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe of failing to protect Irish taxpayers in relation to the bill of almost €250 million for the liquidators of the former Anglo Irish Bank.
In a High Court filing, Hall alleges that the minister, the Department of Finance and the state did not properly set, analyse, assess and monitor the fees paid to the joint special liquidators of IBRC, the bank established to wind down the defunct Anglo Irish and Irish Nationwide.
Fees arising from the special liquidation have reached €247 million, according to a progress report published by the Department of Finance last week.
They are expected to reach between €291 million and €306 million by the time the liquidation process is finished by the end of 2022.
Concerns have been raised that there is no committee of inspection to examine the fees paid to the special liquidators, a situation that has been described as “certainly unusual” by the state auditor, C&AG Seamus McCarthy.
The Public Accounts Committee has been seeking to examine the matter by questioning the minister, the department and the joint special liquidators, Kieran Wallace and Eamonn Richardson, who are both from KPMG.
However, the Department of Finance has told the committee that Hall’s ongoing legal action prevents it from discussing the costs and oversight of fees paid for the IBRC liquidation.
Hall’s statement of claim outlines eight declarations he is seeking from the High Court. These include that the minister failed to assess and/or agree on appropriate hourly rates and instead applied rates used by Nama, the state’s bad bank.
Hall is also seeking court declarations that there “has been and continues to be a failure of oversight” and that the minister has “failed to account to the public” and has discharged fees to the special liquidators “in a manner that is arbitrary, covert, uninformative and/or lacks transparency and/or accountability” and that the minister has failed to act in a “manner consistent with public policy and/or the common good”.
These failures, Hall alleges in his court filing, “constitute serious deficiencies and set precedents that are damaging to the state”.
Hall is being represented by Eames Solicitors.
It is understood that the PAC has discussed privately the possibility of approaching Hall about withdrawing his action in order to allow the committee to probe the liquidation fees.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said neither his department nor the C&AG had “any role in relation to examining the procurement processes” of the special liquidators.

High-flyer Taylor says customers hold key to success

Body


This Friday, Hamish Taylor will deliver the keynote address at the inaugural Retail Ireland annual lunch in Dublin 2’s Conrad Hotel.
An award-winning chief executive whose career has taken him from international consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble to consultancy firm Price Waterhouse, British Airways, Eurostar and then Sainsbury's Bank, all before he was 40 years old, Taylor will underline to those present why customers are key.
“The biggest risk faced by any business is customer risk. It doesn’t matter how well you have handled IT security risk, cashflow risk, etc – if you’ve got no customers, you’ve got no business. Therefore, putting the customer at the centre of everything we do has to be our highest priority,” he told The Sunday Business Post.
“With today’s technology, it is much easier for customers to tell you what they think of you - and they tell everyone else at the same time. Therefore, we need to be quicker than ever at both collecting and responding to customer feedback. Understanding customer ‘needs’ is no longer enough. We need to understand factors such as ‘soft insights’ – how does your customer feel? Sainsbury’s Bank's turnaround came from understanding customer ‘mood’. And real time insights so finding out how they feel at the moment of contact with you - not later when they fill in a questionnaire.”
Managing and assessing expectations are also important, according to Taylor, so that customers don’t judge you on your performance, but on your performance relative to what they expected.
And with so much talk about transformation, upskilling and change, many successful retailers may wonder if the good times are about to end. Taylor wants to reassure them that change for change's sake will not work.
“Innovation in an established business does not have to be about radical changes that throw out the old. If you have a formula that works, understand why it works - ie, what is the benefit to the customer of what you do? - and don’t change this," he said.
"Your innovation can be about new ways of delivering the same benefit using the new tools that are available. Volvo cars deliver the benefit of ‘safety’, and yet a Volvo car today is very different from 20 years ago. In retail, great customer service is still great customer service: however, there may be new innovative ways of delivering this.
"If you want ‘tried and tested’, then innovate by taking ideas from other industries and environments where the ‘innovations’ are already proven. For example, we fixed the queuing problems at Heathrow Airport by using ideas proven in Disney theme parks.”
With so many dos and don’ts in modern business, the pressure on owner managers in the retail sector can be overwhelming. How can they lead boldly and take everyone else with them? And is leadership innate or something which can be taught?
“Of course, leadership can be learned – I look at all the mistakes I have made as a leader and have had to change my subsequent behaviour as a result. Over time, as a leader, you learn to ‘communicate more clearly’, that ‘ruthless simplicity’ is the key to setting priorities, that ‘everyone else knows far more about the business than you do,’ that ‘people follow you when they want to’, not because you tell them to . . . and much more.
"I’m not sure if there is a single ingredient that all leaders possess, but I would argue that most leaders have a defining ingredient that characterises their leadership. This might be resilience, charisma, intelligence or, in my case, enthusiasm.”

Hines boss: €1bn Cherrywood will be a Ranelagh for 21st century

Highlight: Higher density means the new south Dublin development will be more like older Dublin suburbs ‘like Ranelagh or Rathmines’ 
Body


Hines, the Texan family fund owner of Cherrywood will build out most of its planned 1,269 apartments by the end of 2020, its Ireland chief executive Brian Moran said.
Hines and its pensions giant joint venture partner APG got approval last week from planners to start the €1 billion Cherrywood Town Centre, the residential part of the planned new town and its shops, restaurants and other amenities.
“This will be very much the heartbeat of Cherrywood,” Moran said in a call after the announcement on Thursday.
Hines and APG will build and then rent out the apartments. “We’re looking at mid to end of 2020 for phased completion, to start to arrive in Q3 and Q4,” he said.
“Because it has a higher density than traditionally seen in outer suburbs of Dublin, it will be more reminiscent of older Dublin suburbs like Ranelagh and Rathmines.”
“People who live in Cherrywood should be able to walk or bike around the streets and squares to the shops or cinema or restaurants. It will be very pedestrian friendly with an open and embracing town centre.”
Hines, which was founded by US businessman Gerald Hines and is run by his son Jeff, has completed the first phase of infrastructure at Cherrywood required before housing could start.
[caption id="attachment_418055" align="alignleft" width="671"] Brian Moran, chief executive, Hines Ireland Picture: Keith Arkins[/caption]
Each block of the planned apartments in Cherrywood was designed by a different architect to provide variety to the streetscape, Moran said. The apartments are mainly open plan in order to minimise dark narrow corridors and maximise interior space, he said. “We wanted them to be as open and bright as possible and did a lot of work with planners to come up with a much better concept of design.”
The town centre will have a library and a primary healthcare centre as well as restaurants, bars, a cinema, a leisure centre and three parks.
There will be a state of the art all weather multi use pitch, six tennis courts and a sports pavilion.
The apartments will be rented out at full market rate, Moran said. “The Part V [where developers must give up to 10 per cent of land zoned for residential use in new housing developments for social and/or affordable housing] element will be dealt with in discussion with the council,” he said. “The rest are market rate apartments.”
There is also an affordable home component to the development connected to the €15 million of state money put in through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) that finances housing infrastructure like water mains and roads on private development and in return requires developers to produce housing quickly, affordably and at scale, according to the Rebuilding Ireland vision.
Agreement still needs to be reached between Hines and other developers with land at Cherrywood and Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council about the price of these homes, and also the price at which Part V homes will be provided.
“That detail needs to be worked out,” said Moran.
While the vast bulk of lands are owned and controlled by Hines, there are 11 developers with an interest there including Seamus Neville, Nama, Johnny Ronan, Jackson Way, Noel Smyth, Tudor Homes and Starwood.
On the LIHAF, the other landowners and Hines have an informal agreement to work together with the council on an affordable housing scheme, the details of which are to be decided.
Department of Housing documents suggest this would amount to 5 per cent extra affordable homes at Cherrywood additional to the 10 per cent Part V requirement, but Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council was unable to clarify this when contacted.
When the Town Centre element of Cherrywood is completed it will provide homes for 3,200 people, provide office space for a further 2,300 and employment in its retail and leisure outlets for a further 2,500.
The wider Cherrywood area will be home to 25,000, a similar population to Athlone when complete.
Cherrywood is the first suburban Strategic Development Zoned large-scale suburban plan of its kind since Adamstown, which was also envisioned to be home to around 25,000 people, but stalled with the property crash.
Over the next six months, Moran’s team will liaise with prospective tenants for the hotel, restaurants, shops and hotel that are part of the development.
“We’ve had extensive inbound queries,” he said.
“All would be looking for certainty around delivery, so now that we have that in planning we will start to engage very actively with those that have been knocking at our door.
“That will be a huge focus for the team over the next six months.”
Hines has more than $110 billion worth of assets under management and has built large-scale developments in France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Spain and Britain.
It won out in bidding and paid over €270 million for the 400-acre Cherrywood site, acquired from Nama Danske Bank and Lloyds.

The €1 billion mixed-use development will include 1,269 build-to-rent apartments, 54,350 square metres of retail and office space and extensive leisure space.
The decision will allow Hines to embark on the largest single urban development project in the country.
Located between Cabinteely and Loughlinstown, Cherrywood town centre will be built on an elevated site linking the existing Luas stops at Cherrywood and Bride’s Glen. The new urban quarter will prioritise pedestrians and bike users and will incorporate both covered and open public spaces as well as an extensive array of shops, bars and restaurants, and a 200-room hotel and other leisure facilities.
It is expected that construction on the three-year project will start at the end of this year and will provide housing for more than 3,200 people, office accommodation for 2,300 and employment for an additional 2,500 retail and leisure workers.
As well as the town centre project, Hines has just submitted a new planning application for 146 one, two and three-bedroom apartments in four blocks, situated at the junction of Bishops Street and Tullyvale Road, its first application outside of the Town Centre.
The group also recently submitted a separate planning application for the first new (primary) school for 700 pupils within the Cherrywood development.

The former St Vincent’s Catholic church in Cork city has come to market in two lots through Lisney and is guiding a combined €1.5 million, or €750,000 each for the church and an adjacent development site.
Consecrated in 1906 and forced to close 110 years later – in 2016 – because of a lack of priests, the now deconsecrated church is a listed, protected structure located 1km north-west of Cork city centre on the southern side of Sundays Well Road. It adjoins the UCC School of Music and is close to the UCC North Mall Campus, which includes UCC’s School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, and is within walking distance of the Mercy Hospital.
Designed by John Benson to an early Gothic style, the church and a half-acre it sits on make up lot one. Mainly a single-storey building, the distinctive red sandstone structure has pitched timber and slated roofs and features stained glass windows. Part of the lower ground floor incorporates a mezzanine level and there is an upper floor organ room. The total floor area is about 1,170 square metres and the internal apex height in the main church area is 15.4 metres.
The main front car park is included as part of the sale and has 18 surface car spaces currently operated under a licence agreement by Parking People. The property is situated in an area zoned residential, local services and institutional uses. It would suit various alternative uses subject to planning permission including offices, educational or an event centre, for example.
The second lot comprises a south-facing development site of about 1.15 acres situated to the east of St Vincent’s Church.
It has frontage of some 88 metres to Sundays Well Road along its northern boundary, although Sundays Well Road is at a higher level. The site is currently overgrown and access is from Rock Well Lane which connects Sundays Well Road with the eastern boundary of the site.
There are no buildings on the site, although there is a disused former basketball court. The site is zoned residential, local services and institutional uses.
Given the significant drop-down to the site from Sundays Well Road, there is potential for a high-rise residential development or student accommodation development, subject to planning permission, according to the agent.
More details are available from Lisney's South Mall branch in Cork.

How technology has transformed how we manage our money

Highlight: It’s not that long ago that the cheque book was a common sight at tills, whereas today it’s all about mobile payments, fingerprint verification and instant transfers, writes Jess Kelly 
Body


A study published by Wolfgang Digital earlier this year shows Ireland’s online economy is worth around €12.3 billion, proving we are open to spending in the digital space. Technology has most certainly made an impact in-store too.
“The usage of mobile payments in Ireland is on par with, or ahead of, most other European markets, and Irish consumers are feeling increasingly comfortable making transactions on their mobile devices,” said Philip Konopik, country manager in Ireland for payment giant Visa.
Konopik has been in his current role since February 2016 and many changes have occurred during that time. The company’s recent Digital Payments study shows 50 per cent of Irish people now shop with their mobile devices.
“Like all new technology though, mobile payments will take time to become established. For context, contactless payments launched in Ireland in 2013 and it took three years for them to feature in 10 per cent of face-to-face transactions. However, in the following two years, contactless payments jumped to over 40 per cent of face-to-face transactions. Mobile payments are likely to follow a similar trend.
“As it stands, almost four out of five people in Ireland now use their mobile device to manage money, conduct banking and make everyday payments,” he said.
“There has been a massive shift to digital payments in general, with Irish consumers now spending more by card than cash. This is a trend that will only continue and also has genuine economic benefits. A recent study conducted by Visa showed that the economic benefit of Dublin alone going cashless would be €1.35 billion per year.”
Sometimes long-standing businesses have to be dragged into the modern times kicking and screaming — was that the case with Visa, or has the company welcomed the changes?
“As a global leader in payments technology, Visa always aims to be at the forefront of change,” said Konopik.
“We are constantly innovating and thinking about the future. For example, when we launched contactless payments over ten years ago, many people said it would never take off, but now they are ubiquitous, not only in Ireland, but globally.
“Similarly, we recently began the rollout of Visa Direct, which is an innovative payments platform that enables real-time payments for both businesses and consumers. This will change how Ireland’s consumers and businesses pay each other, for example, allowing you to instantly pay your plumber when he’s finished a job for you.”
This is a welcome development for the on-demand generation who have looked towards FinTech startups for such a service in the past. Companies like Circle Pay made a decent dent in this space. It makes sense for Visa to place itself in that realm.
How have Visa’s business customers responded to the new developments in recent years?
“Businesses tend to be extremely positive about new payment methods. Ultimately, digital payments save time since retailers have to spend less time counting coins and notes and are more secure due to the reduced risk of theft.
“We are just at the start of our journey though, as retailers and other businesses begin to understand how digitising their operations can truly transform and improve all elements of what they do — from automating accounting and inventory management to delivering customer insights and loyalty programmes,” said Konopik.
Security is always front-of-mind when it comes to money. Each technological development that goes to market needs to earn its security stripes, so to speak. Just how secure are the convenient mobile payments we’re so fond of?
“Security is at the forefront of everything Visa does and underpins any new technologies that we introduce to the market. Mobile payments are no exception and we continue to work very closely with all of our partners to ensure that mobile payments are as secure as they can be.
“One of the best security features in this respect is biometric authentication on smartphones where people effectively use their thumbprint to authenticate their purchase. This is just the tip of the iceberg though, and digital payments, including mobile, employ multiple security features to protect payment information and mitigate against fraud.
“Consumers can rest assured that mobile payments are already extremely secure and continue to become more so as additional security features are introduced.”
As we progress into a more connected world, what can we expect from our payments?
“The payments landscape in Ireland will continue to evolve rapidly. In the short term, we expect to see huge developments in areas like transportation as operators move away from cash and ticketed travel towards contactless enabled transport solution,” said Konopik.
“Innovation in payments won’t slowing down any time soon. The Internet of Things (IoT) is driving change at an incredible speed. Over the coming years, IoT will pave the way for automated commerce as connected devices create a frictionless payment experience.
“Irish consumers and businesses will find payments becoming an increasingly seamless part of many of the digital experiences that they already take for granted.”

Body


The HSE has failed to publish a performance report detailing how the €15 billion organisation is functioning since September 2017.
Between 2008-2016 the HSE published these reports - which detail the HSE’s performance in respect of access, quality, finance and human resources - on a monthly basis.
In 2017, it began publishing quarterly reports, but the last published report was for July-September 2017. The HSE was unable to clarify why publication of these reports has been so badly delayed.
The health service and the government have come in for serious criticism in recent weeks about a perceived lack of accountability and poor governance within the HSE, which has not had a board since since 2011.
“It is deeply worrying that no performance data has been available for eight months,” said Fianna Fáil health spokesperson Stephen Donnelly.
Donnelly called on Minister for Health Simon Harris to publish an up-to-date performance report.
Sinn Féin health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly said “good governance must be underpinned by transparency, openness and accountability and the withholding of information suggests that this is not the case”.
O’Reilly said she believed the “discontinuation of these performance reports is further evidence of a drift from accountability, oversight, and performance analysis. The fact that a performance report has not been released since September 2017 smacks of a fear of transparency and accountability.
“We need to see a return to the publication of quarterly reports so the performance of the health service can be properly scrutinised.”

Illegal adoption scandal widens

Highlight: Agency run by the Dublin Archdiocese involved in illegal adoptions; Government ignored calls to audit adoptions handled by Pro Cathedral; Joan Burton 'faced a 50-year wall of silence and resistance'
Body


The scandal involving illegal adoptions has widened to include an agency run by Dublin’s Pro Cathedral, which was involved in the false registration of birth details similar to the cases highlighted by Katherine Zappone, the Minister for Children, last week.
The Sunday Business Post has proof of two cases where illegal adoptions were handled by the Rotunda Girls Aid Society (RGAS), which was established and operated by the Dublin Archdiocese and had an address at the Pro Cathedral.
The Adoption Rights Alliance said it is aware of a further 15 cases of illegal adoptions involving the agency which dealt with a large number of cases in Dublin’s north inner city up to the 1980s. It said it has been highlighting concerns about the RGAS with the government as far back as 2002.
The Pro Cathedral handed 15,000 files of adoptions over to the HSE in 2009 and said it had “not been involved in placing children for adoption for many years” when those documents were transferred.
In one case, a file containing a woman’s birth and adoption details from 1955 were discovered by a passerby in a skip on the North Circular Road in Dublin and handed into the RGAS, which subsequently gave it over to the HSE.
The individual, who does not wish to be identified, has written confirmation from the HSE dating from 2009 stating that the circumstances surrounding their adoption were an “illegal registration”.
Another woman, Dolores Quinlan, has documentary proof of her illegal adoption being reported to the health authorities when she was just a month old. A report submitted by a public health nurse with a date in 1966, is headed “child not legally adopted” and describes how an infant was “found” in a corporation house.
She wants the state to provide her with a lawful birth certificate recognising her birth mother’s name. “The government has known about me since I was a couple of weeks old, there is documentary evidence stating that I had been found and illegally adopted,” she said.
A spokesperson for the Dublin Archdiocese said it cannot comment on individual cases, but that “the diocese would welcome a thorough investigation of the history of adoption in Ireland over the years”.
It said: “We have always provided information from the diocesan archives to the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, some of which is relevant to adoptions.”
A statement from the Department of Children in response to a number of queries said that, “while there have been suspicions about the practice of incorrect registrations for many years, it has been extremely difficult to uncover clear evidence”.
It said the 126 cases of incorrect birth registrations at Saint Patrick’s Guild “are the only confirmed cases of incorrect birth registrations that the Department is currently aware that have been validated” and that “contain evidence of such practices to a high level of certainty”.
Separately, the former tánaiste Joan Burton said last week’s announcement by the government that there had been 126 illegal adoptions by St Patrick’s Guild “opens many old wounds because even today, after close to 50 years of searching, I do not have the full story of my natural mother’s life”.
Writing in this newspaper, she describes how she faced a “wall of silence and resistance” to her requests from St Patrick’s Guild and was 50 years old before she was granted access to her records.
“I have many memories of the nervous trek to the front door of its Dublin office as I pleaded time and time again, fruitlessly, for access to information about my own birth mother.

Ireland’s lost boys and girls

Highlight: The epidemic of illegal adoptions in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, where birth certs were falsified, is a shattering story that is slowly coming to light. Here, two women put up for adoption at birth tell their stories 
Body


If it wasn’t for a random act of decency, Joanne might never have found out who she is. After a private nursing home on the North Circular Road in Dublin was closed down in the 1990s, a passer-by found a green ledger paper in a skip and picked it up. On further inspection, the person discovered it was a file on babies and details of their adoptions.
It contained eight lines about Joanne, including the name of her mother, with a handwritten note that “no money or fees” were exchanged for her adoption. It also contained the names of her adoptive parents with an instruction that she was “to be baptised and registered in their name”.
This is one part of the proof she now has that the information on her birth certificate was falsified in a way that concealed her true identity. It was an identity that was assembled like pieces of a jigsaw, starting when she was 43 and found out for the first time that she was adopted.
Joanne’s mother had been suffering from dementia in 1998, and was on her deathbed when she had a moment of lucidity.
“She rose out of her dementia just before she died, to tell me. It was like she decided that she wasn’t going to die until she told me,” said Joanne, who does not want her real name printed to protect her family.
“It was like a tsunami going through me.”
It took some years before Joanne went about tracing her birth family. She immediately ran into difficulty because her adoptive parents were registered as her birth parents. Crucially, though, her birth cert had an address on the North Circular Road, where she was born. She was informed by a social worker at Barnardo’s, which was helping her with her search, that this address had been the site of a private nursing home where many women had given birth to babies who were subsequently adopted.
This was one of dozens of such homes scattered around Dublin. They operated mostly from the 1950s to the 1970s. They were private houses where women, sometimes married but more often not, went to have babies in secret. Many had travelled up from the country, with different homes catering informally for girls from different counties.
Joanne eventually did a DNA test which linked her to a family. She checked this family against the name contained in the document found in the skip, which had been brought to her attention 20 years earlier, and put two and two together.
Unfortunately, her mother had earlier passed away and they never got a chance to meet. But she was delighted to be warmly welcomed by her family.
The Rotunda Girls Aid Society (RGAS) was the agency that found adoptive parents for the babies born in this particular nursing home and many others like it in Dublin’s north inner city. This was an adoption society established by Dublin’s Pro Cathedral in the 19th century, according to a statement from the Dublin Archdiocese.
Some 15,000 adoption records were handed over to the HSE in 2009, and subsequently given to Tusla. The Dublin Archdiocese said it had not been involved in placing children for adoption for years before that.
In a letter dated from 1940 to the St Margaret of Cortona hospital on Townsend Street, a priest describes the role of the RGAS as “to help a decent class of girl, a first offender, whose fall was mainly to ignorance or weakness, I mean one of a good family whom it will be possible to rehabilitate”.
The agency was particularly active in the years when John Charles McQuaid was the Archbishop of Dublin. One of McQuaid’s obsessions was to ensure that women stayed in Ireland and put their “illegitimate” children in Catholic homes, preventing them from travelling to England, where they might end up with Protestant families.
The agency had links to the crisis pregnancy agency Cura.
Like the 126 cases of people illegally registered at birth at St Patrick’s Guild which were highlighted by Minister for Children Katherine Zappone last week, The Sunday Business Post has discovered two confirmed cases where births were falsely registered by RGAS, including Joanne’s case. The Adoption Rights Alliance (ARA) has said it is aware of 15 cases of falsified birth records of babies whose adoptions, it says, were “brokered” by the RGAS.
Dolores Quinlan was almost 50 when she discovered she was adopted. Just after her mother died, two years ago, she got into a conversation with her father about her birth. He did not have the answer to any of her questions, and she asked, almost jokingly: “I wasn’t adopted, was I?” He quietly nodded his head, and her world “went into orbit”.
Dolores found out that she had, in her own words, been “handed over” in the front room of her aunt’s house in Dublin. It was arranged by a doctor who is now dead. Her birth cert names her adoptive parents as her birth parents and was therefore falsified. It was only when she met her birth mother, three weeks ago, that she discovered that the RGAS was involved.
During the course of her research, Dolores was given a document by Tusla which she believes shows that illegal adoptions were an open secret for many years. It was a written complaint made by a district nurse who, on a visit to her house, saw a newborn baby in a Moses basket and wondered how she got there. The nurse reported to the health board that a baby had been “found”, and that the only explanation was that the infant had been “not legally adopted”.
“This day last year I was in a hospice with my Dad. I wish my Dad was alive now. He missed all the good news, he was supportive of me finding my true identity and my birth mother. I’m grateful for their love and just wish he could see the newspaper tomorrow. I know they would be so proud,” Dolores said.
“The government has known about me since I was weeks old. There is documentary evidence stating that I had been found and illegally adopted,” said Dolores.
Joanne, too, said she had proof that the authorities were aware of her illegal adoption. She refers to a letter from the HSE in 2009, in response to her seeking information, in which they said they could not provide information “as your birth was an illegal registration”.
“I am not looking to blame anyone, not even the RGAS. It was a society thing, everyone was in on it,” she said. “But what I do want to know is: why now? They have known for years.”
A spokesperson for Zappone said 126 cases where births were illegally registered by St Patrick’s Guild are the only confirmed cases of incorrect birth registrations that the department was currently aware of that had been validated to a high level of certainty.
Zappone has appointed Marion Reynolds, deputy director of social services in the North, to oversee a “sampling exercise” of adoption records to assess what further investigation might be required on what appears to be a widespread practice of illegal adoptions.
The Adoption Rights Alliance wrote to Reynolds last Friday, to ensure that RGAS and adoptions by the Dublin Archdiocese were included. It said it had been raising cases of the RGAS with the government as far back as 2002, and with Tusla since 2005.
The ARA, and other campaigners, say they have spent the best part of two decades trying to press upon politicians what they believe to have been the biggest Church and state scandal that Ireland has yet to reveal. Politicians, they say, would not listen to them.
The document in the skip was handed to the RGAS by the passer-by. It was given over to the HSE, along with the other files. Tusla would not comment on whether it was aware of it.
When Dolores asked her mother last week why she went to the particular agency in Dublin, she discovered, coincidentally, that she had been sent there by Joanne’s mother. Both women have come into contact while researching their true identity, discovering that their mothers had been friends who shared a similar secret.
They are among the 150,000 Irish women forced to place their babies up for adoption since the 1950s, with their daughters among the few to have found out who they truly are.
Both women want to stress that they do not want to apportion blame or point any fingers. All they want is for the state to provide them with truthful birth certs to reflect their birth mothers, and adoptive certs to recognise the families they grew up with.
“I accept times were very different back then, and we are evolving into a healthier, transparent nation. I’m ready to begin the healing process and luckily in my role as a psychotherapist I’m hoping I can help other adoptees about to go through the same process,” said Dolores Quinlan. “I’m not angry with the past. I just want my real name back.”

The first part of his career involved manoeuvring fast cars around race tracks. Now, Eddie Irvine, the former Formula 1 racing driver, has turned real estate tycoon, and is selling two properties in Florida for close to $50 million.
One luxury home was sold last month for just over $17 million and another is on sale with an asking price of close to $30 million.
Tupelo Sunset LLC, an Irvine-controlled vehicle, along with other companies related to him, have sold over $60 million worth of Miami property in recent years, selling one or two houses a year.
When Irvine began to make money from Formula 1 in the early 1990s he started to get involved in investing in property, first in Ireland and then later in Miami, where he went on to branch into property development.
[caption id="attachment_418083" align="alignleft" width="253"] Eddie Irvine is involved in developing high-end property in Florida[/caption]
In mid-May, 126 West San Marino Drive was sold for $17.9 million. Irvine is reported to have bought it for around $6 million three years ago.
Another, Casa Ischia, also in Miami Beach, went on the market for $29.5 million boasting seven bedrooms, a bar, a movie theatre, a wine cellar, two spas and a pool. It was bought for just over $5 million.
Irvine recently told Property Week, an industry magazine, that he started off around 1992 buying houses in Ireland and renting them out.
Then when he retired from racing in 2002 and had more time he started getting involved in actually developing homes, including houses in his native Northern Ireland where he has several sites and plans to increase activity.
In Miami after the property crash in 2005, Irvine started to buy up waterfront lots or foreclosed properties that were selling for as little as $1 million and building high-end luxury homes on them before selling them on for up to $30 million. He has said that he develops them as if he himself was going to live in them.
He once owned a lavish Dalkey home which controversial mixed martial arts athlete Conor McGregor rented for more than €20,000 a month.
From Bangor in Co Down, Irvine raced for Jordan, Ferrari and Jaguar in a decade-long racing career.
He owns a private island in the Exuma Cays in the Bahamas.

Is it time for a third force in Irish banking?

Length: 811 words

Highlight: Now that the foreign banks are well and truly gone, we need stronger competition to prevent AIB and BoI from permanently dominating the market 
Body


It is nearly 20 years since Bank of Scotland began the invasion of foreign banks into Ireland. This turned out to be a mostly ill-fated and disastrous foray into Irish banking. In 1999, the British lender caused a near panic when it entered the Irish mortgage market by undercutting every lender with what was then a rock bottom variable interest rate of just shy of 4 per cent.
Every bank was ultimately to follow suit in an unprecedented price war. At the time, the profit margins were still juicy and the universal view was that house prices would never crash, so the cuts could be justified. The seemingly easy success of Bank of Scotland encouraged many other foreign banks to enter the Irish market. Danske, Rabobank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and more followed or doubled down their Irish exposure. When the crash came the foreign banks fled, along with tens of billions of euro in losses.
This exodus of financial institutions has left the country with two large full-service banks in AIB and Bank of Ireland and three small rivals in the form of Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB and KBC. In most countries there is usually only a handful of lenders, so Ireland is not unique in that sense. What does stand out is that the two biggest have commanding market shares in pretty much all ends of banking, from current accounts to mortgage lending, business loans and corporate banking. The competition are way behind in size and market share. All of which plays into the price we all pay for financial services.
It is unlikely that foreign banks will be tempted to set up shop in Ireland again. Good luck to any executive that tries to sell the idea of starting an Irish operation following one of the most extensive and expensive collapses in the history of global finance. But stronger competition is needed here to prevent a duopoly taking hold for good.
Perhaps it is time to revisit an idea that has been floated intermittently for almost a decade: the creation of a third force in Irish banking. At various stages there have been so many permutations considered in terms of what banks would form part of it that the phrase “third force” has become a running joke among some analysts and commentators
We may, however, be reaching a point where the formation of a viable entity to challenge AIB and Bank of Ireland is a possibility. Rumours have been swirling for months now that a combination of Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank would finally make sense for the banks and their majority owners.
The Irish and British governments are the majority shareholders of the respective banks (Ulster is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, of which the British government owns 70 per cent). No government wants to be in control of a bank ten years on from the crisis, but the difficulty of getting out easily and without losing more money has been one of the reasons why taxpayers have controlled these lenders for a decade.
It may be time to accept that the recouping of all of the bailouts those banks have received is unlikely in the current situation and a creative solution is needed. A deal could be structured that allows the Irish state to end its majority ownership of PTSB, but gives taxpayers plenty of upside in a combined business.
That might tempt the British government and RBS. The bank has retrenched from many of its overseas activities and has focused on its core British market. It has also ring-fenced its Northern Ireland unit from the rest of the island. Carving out Ulster Bank from the rest of the bank, while not without its difficulties, would be much easier now than several years ago, and while RBS is unlikely ever to recover the cash it poured into the lender, it would be a way to unlock some of the capital sitting in Ulster Bank.
Any possible deal will depend on the two banks first cleaning up the legacy non-performing loans that are clogging up their balance sheets. In the case of PTSB, a quarter of all its loans are classed as non-performing. The response of both banks has been to package up these loans and sell them to investors. PTSB’s €2.2 billion Project Glas loan book is expected to be sold later this year, while Ulster’s Project Scariff, the sale of a €1.6 billion book of home loans and buy-to-let properties, will also be concluded this year. With those sales out of the way, the banks will begin to look normal, but still lag behind AIB and Bank of Ireland in size.
I understand that a tie-up was previously looked at among the two banks at government level a few years ago, but never really went anywhere. Perhaps now the time is approaching to look at it again. A combined entity with real muscle would provide competition across business and consumer banking. Without it the march of the big two will not be halted. It’s also unlikely that the taxpayers who rescued RBS and Permanent TSB will get their investment back for some time.

Highlight: With Brexit on the horizon and the Italian people growing disillusioned with Brussels by the day, the time has come for a major rethink of Europe-wide policy 
Body


The events in Italy and Spain must be unsettling for ardent Europhiles. Italy, traditionally a rich western European nation and the cradle of much of our civilisation, has been encumbered with an unworkable currency, the euro, which has caused huge misery. A whole generation of young Italians has seen its future blighted by the actions of enthusiastic pro-EU politicians, who were more interested in ingratiating themselves with Brussels and Germany than with looking after the economic wellbeing of their own citizens. Many subsequently went on to land lucrative posts in EU institutions.
In any normal functioning democracy, there is always the option of voting out the failed politicians and reversing their policies. However, this is not always how the game is played inside the EU. The result of the Italian election was clear-cut in one respect: the Italian people are fed up with the old way of doing things, and want radical and effective change. This has propelled two parties opposed to European Federalism, the Five Star Movement and Lega, into a position to form a majority government.
No matter how people may view these parties, and there is certainly an unsavoury element to them, there is absolutely no doubt that they essentially won a fair, free and democratic election. However, their Euroscepticism has raised hackles in Brussels and, more importantly, in Berlin.
It is speculated that, at the behest of the German government and the Brussels establishment, Italian president Sergio Mattarella (who was appointed by the outgoing failed government) vetoed a key appointment. The proposed new finance minister, Paolo Savona, consistently held for many years that Italy made a historic mistake by joining the euro.
It was a statement of the blindingly obvious. However, this was a step too far for the Europhile elements. In another time period, Galileo was once forced to recant his belief that the Earth revolved around the Sun. Now the Italian president and Brussels wanted the new government to recant its criticism of the effects of the euro on Italy.
Mattarella added insult to injury by asking Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund senior official known as Mr Scissors for making cuts to public spending, to lead a technocratic government. This was an overt signal that, despite the wishes of the Italian population, it would be business as usual.
If this happened in a Third World country, liberals in the West would be up in arms. However, clearly there is a double set of standards operating when the interests of the Brussels establishment are at stake.
The leader of the Five Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, was quoted as saying: “In this country, you can be a condemned criminal, a tax fraud convict, under investigation for corruption and be a minister . . . but if you criticise Europe, you cannot be an economy minister,”. Clearly Ireland is not the only country where the EU is regarded by some as a sacred cow.
Italy, a founder member of the European Economic Community and an ardent Europhile country in the past, has had a difficult time in the last decade and badly needs to escape the shackles of Berlin-imposed austerity and membership of the euro. Its statistics for unemployment, especially among young people, economic growth, demographic trends, sovereign indebtedness etc, all make grim reading. It needs to devise a completely new set of policies.
However, Cottarelli could get very little support and promptly stepped down. A new reconstituted government of the Five Star and Lega parties will take power and will set about major changes, including the possible launch of a parallel domestic currency alongside the euro. The new government is also committed to ending Italian sanctions against Russia.
The logical approach would be to assist Italy to exit the euro in an ordered manner and to work with the new leaders to ensure that their policies do not harm too greatly the interests of neighbouring countries. Instead of confrontation, mutual cooperation should be the order of the day.
But this is unlikely if the EU establishment views any new Italian government as not operating in its interest or not signed up to even greater European integration. It will also be inconvenient for Brussels to have a new Italian prime minister at European Council meetings who is committed to softening the hardline, self-defeating EU approach to Brexit.
The new government in Spain, with Pedro Sánchez replacing the über- Europhile Mariano Rajoy, will not make policy switches as dramatic as Rome will, but the new government, which has the support of a disparate grouping of parties, will be much more balanced. These changes will not go down well in Brussels, which has no love for the democratic process.
This elitist disdain for the will of the ordinary voter is also seen in the vocabulary of Brussels which pours such scorn on phrases like populism, nationalism and so on. There is a stream of thought inside the EU, that matters relating to the European project are just too complicated for the average Joe Soap and really should be kept out of the hands of elected politicians: hence the most powerful body is the unelected and independent European Commission, which operates as the executive power in supranational fashion. It alone can, in reality, initiate new policies and laws.
This is the body with which we have placed our future in the Brexit negotiations. As events have demonstrated so clearly in the past, the Commission has its own agenda, and should we show any signs of independence, then our alliance will be over immediately. The bailout, where the interests of European banks, and in particular the vulnerable German financial institutions, were given precedence over the rules of the ECB and natural justice, demonstrated this in no uncertain manner.
Therefore, if Ireland decides, along with Britain, that the Irish border issue can be solved by exempting local border traffic and some other goods, as well as enhanced use of technology, (including upgrading the existing cameras near the border which are already used for vehicle identification purposes), then expect Brussels to come down hard on Dublin. At the moment, Ireland is a hostage to the EU strategic objective of keeping Britain inside its economic orbit.
The shambles in London is, of course, a matter for concern for all those wanting to see a satisfactory outcome to the Brexit process. The worst possible result for this country would be a messy Brexit or a two-stage Brexit, where Britain initially stays inside a form of customs union and there is a need for a second stage. It would be much better all round if we could have a clean break now.
Commercial interests and citizens do not reward uncertainty, but rapidly adjust to new circumstances, especially if there is a clear way forward. Anybody looking at longer-term projections cannot but conclude that we need to adjust to Brexit, not spend our time and resources resisting it. In regard to Brexit, the genie is truly out of the bottle and will not be reversed without mayhem.
I am fearful that the Irish government is on a course that is running against the historic trends, by its close embrace of Brussels, at a time when elsewhere in Europe, the EU federalism star is waning.
Meanwhile, Brussels continues to propose actions like excluding Britain from the Galileo programme which is contrary to our interests and the close collaboration between Irish and British research institutions. The commission has also proposed a new digital tax, pushing the CCCT and, of course, advocating that those using electric bicycles and golf buggies should have motor insurance, hardly likely to go down well here.
Meanwhile, Ireland is alienating our closest neighbour with our intransigent policy stance and above all by our aggressive rhetoric. It is hard to discern the strategic Irish government thinking behind it all.
Even the billionaire financier and anti-Brexit campaigner George Soros is now of the view that the EU must reform or perish. It needs to drop the grandiose ideas of a single army, single currency, ECB-inspired austerity, a banking union, etc, and become a grouping of like-minded nations which will preserve their own identity and cooperate in areas like free trade, mutual recognition, Erasmus programmes and so on. This type of new arrangement would attract Britain back into the fold and lower the antagonism in other countries towards European cooperation.
Maybe the Irish government could propose something along these lines as a viable way forward, namely the Varadkar initiative as a counterweight to the failing Macron proposals. If reform is not grasped, the long-term future of the EU, and especially the eurozone, must be in serious doubt.

Italy’s problem is Europe’s problem

Highlight: The Italian political crisis eased last week, but  the threat to the eurozone from Italy’s debt mountain is very real 
Body


The last fortnight has been a real rollercoaster for the European markets and politics. Only two weeks ago, I wrote about the problems of rising political populism in Italy and Spain as the signals of a broader trend across the block’s member states. Last week, in Spain, the no confidence motion in Mariano Rajoy’s government played as a sideshow to Rome’s drama.
The timeline of events in Italy provides the background to last week’s lessons.
The country has been governed by a lame-duck executive since mid-2016. Fed up with Rome’s gridlock, in the March 2018 general election the Italian electorate endorsed a parliament split between the populist-left M5S and the far-right group of parties led by the League. A month and a half of League-M5S negotiations have produced a shared policies platform, replete with radical proposals for reshaping the country’s Byzantine tax and social welfare systems.
The platform also contained highly controversial proposals to force the ECB to write down €250 billion-worth of government debt, a plan for restructuring fiscal rules to allow the country to run larger fiscal deficits, and a call for immigration system reforms.
Last Monday, the president of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, a loyal euro supporter, vetoed the M5S-League candidate for the economic ministry, the Eurosceptic Paolo Savona.
The result was the resignation of the League-M5S prime minister-designate, Giuseppe Conte, and a threat of an appointment of the unpopular technocrat Carlo Cottarelli, an ex-IMF economist nicknamed Mr Scissors for his staunch support of austerity, as a caretaker prime minister.
By Thursday night, Conte was back in the saddle, with a new coalition government agreed and set to be sworn in on Friday.
Crisis avoided? Not so fast.
The markets followed the political turns and twists of the drama. Last Tuesday, Italian bonds posted their worst daily performance in over 20 years. The spike in the two-year bond yield was spectacular, going from 0.3 per cent on Monday morning to 2.73 per cent on Tuesday, before slipping back to 1.26 per cent on Thursday.
The ten-year Italian bond yield leaped from 2.37 per cent to 3.18 per cent within the first two days, falling to 2.84 per cent a day after.
To put these bond yields’ movements into perspective, at the week’s peak yields, the cost of funding Italy’s €2.256 trillion mountain of government debt would have risen by €45 billion per annum - more than the forecast deficit increases under the reforms proposed in the League-M5S programme.
Thus, despite the immediate crisis yielding to the new coalition, a heavy cloud of uncertainty still hangs over the eurozone’s third-largest member state. Should the new government fail to deliver on a unified platform built by an inherently unstable coalition, the new election will be on offer. This is likely to turn into a plebiscite on Italy’s membership of the euro. And it will also raise the spectre of another markets meltdown.
The lessons from this week’s spike in political uncertainty are threefold. All are bad for Italy and for the entire eurozone. First, after years of QE-induced amnesia, the investment markets are now ready to force huge volatility and rapid risk-repricing into sovereign bonds valuations.
Secondly, despite all the talk in Brussels and Rome about the robustness of post-2011 reforms, the Italian economy remains stagnant, incapable of withstanding any significant uptick in the historically low borrowing costs that prevailed over recent years, with its financial system still vulnerable to shocks.
Thirdly, the feared contagion from Italy to the rest of the eurozone is not a distant echo of the crises past, but a very present danger.
[caption id="attachment_417944" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S)[/caption]
Italy’s debt mountain is the powder keg, ready to explode. The IMF forecasts from April this year envision Italian debt-to-GDP ratio dropping from 131.5 per cent at the end of 2017 to 116.6 per cent in 2023. However, should the average cost of debt rise just 200 basis points on IMF’s central scenario, hitting 4 per cent, the debt ratio is set to rise to 137 per cent. Last Wednesday’s bond auction achieved a gross yield of 3 per cent on ten-year bonds.
In other words, Italy’s fiscal and economic dynamics are unsustainable under a combination of higher risk premiums, and the ECB monetary policy normalisation. The risk of the former was playing out this week and will remain in place into 2019. The latter is expected to start around November-December and then accelerate.
With the government crisis unfolding, the probability of Italy leaving the euro within 12 months, measured by Sentix Italexit index, jumped from 3.6 per cent at the end of the previous week to 12.3 per cent last Tuesday before moderating to 11 per cent at the end of Thursday. This puts at risk not only Italian government bonds, but the private sector debt as well, amounting to close to €2 trillion. A rise in the cost of this debt, in line with government debt risk scenarios, will literally sink the economy into a recession.
As Italian government bond spreads shot up, other European markets felt the pain. Based on the data from Deutsche Bank Research, at the start of 2018, foreign banks, non-bank investors and the official sector, including the euro system, held circa 48 per cent of Italian government debt. In Spain and Portugal, this number was closer to 65 per cent. In other words, the risk of falling bonds prices is both material and broadly distributed across the European financial system for all ‘peripheral’ euro states.
As a part of its quantitative easing programme, the ECB has purchased some €250 billion-worth of Italian bonds. A significant uptick in risk of Italy’s default on these bonds will put political pressure on ECB. And Frankfurt will face greater political uncertainty in dealing with the future financial and fiscal crises.
Research from the Bank for International Settlements puts Italian banks’ holdings of government bonds at roughly €450 billion. The ten largest Italian banks have sovereign debt exposures that exceed their tier one capital. As the value of these bonds plunges, the solvency risks rise too. Not surprisingly, over the last two weeks, shares of the large Italian banks fell 10-20 per cent. These declines in equity prices, in turn, are driving solvency risks even higher. Beyond the Italian banks, French financial institutions held some €44 billion-worth of Italian bonds, while Spanish banks were exposed to €29 billion, according to the European Banking Authority.
The second-order effects of the Italian risk contagion play through the other ‘peripheral’ eurozone bonds. As events of this week unfolded, in line with Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have experienced relatively sharp drops in their bond values. All three are also subject to elevated political uncertainty at home, exacerbated by the Italian crisis.
Thus, if the Italian government bond yields head up, banks’ balance sheets risks mount through both direct exposure to the Italian government bonds and indirect effects from Italian contagion on the broader government debt markets, as well as to private sector lending.
All indications now are that the Italian contagion crisis is receding. The new risk triggers are shifting out into late 2018 and early 2019. The uneasy coalition between two populist moments, the M5S and the League, is unlikely to survive the onslaught of voter dissatisfaction with the state of the economy and continued immigration crisis. At the same time, the coalition will be facing a highly sceptical EU, hell-bent on assuring that the M5S-League government does not achieve much progress on its reforms. All in all, the new government has between six and 12 months to run before we see a new election looming on the horizon.
The Italian crisis might be easing, but it is not going away any time soon. Neither is the Spanish one. Oh, and with a major credit downgrade from Standard & Poor’s and the US Fed, here comes the systemic behemoth of European finance, the Deutsche Bank.

Joan Burton: I have my own history with St Patrick’s Guild

Highlight: Half a century after I began searching for information about my birth mother, Ireland continues to treat adopted children like second-class citizens 
Body


Every so often a new revelation reignites debate about the hidden stories that lie behind Ireland’s adoption history.
So it was last week, when Minister Katherine Zappone released some information about the faking of some birth certificates of children who had been given into the care of the St Patrick’s Guild.
I have my own history with St Patrick’s Guild and I have many memories of the nervous trek to the front door of its Dublin office as I pleaded time and again, fruitlessly, for access to information about my own birth mother.
As I write this, I have beside me a passport issued by the government of Ireland from when I was about three months old to enable me be taken to the USA or Newfoundland.
That never, in fact, happened. It appears that my health at the time was not robust enough to satisfy prospective adoptive couples who came in search of Catholic babies to take across the Atlantic.
Much has been written in fact and fiction about this sordid trade in babies in the years after the Second World War.
The journalist Mike Milotte has written an authoritative book on the subject, while John Banville has explored the issue in the earliest of his Benjamin Black novels, such as Christine Falls and Silver Swan. It also features dramatically in Martin Sixsmith’s fascinating story of Philomena Lee and her lost child, which has been made into a film.
With all this material available for so long, it is a surprise that this week’s latest episode should shock. Yet it does.
For me, it opens many old wounds because even today, after close on 50 years of searching, I still do not have the full story of my natural mother’s life.
I started my search soon after the early death from cancer of my adoptive mother when I was about 20.
I did know I was adopted from an early age and that I had come to the Burtons from St Patrick’s Guild.
I faced a wall of silence and resistance to all of my requests for even basic information. I gave the Guild a letter, to be sent to my birth mother on the occasion of my marriage, but they refused to send it on.
I was close to 50 years of age when I finally was allowed some access to my records and was shown the famous passport. By that time I had graduated from university, had qualified and worked as a professional accountant and lecturer, had been elected a TD and served as a minister.
Even then, there was a marked reluctance to reveal full details. My birth mother had died a few years earlier, never knowing how I had fared in life since she had been forced, by local clerical pressure, to hand me over to ‘the nuns’, who were prepared to arrange an adoption (at, I might add, a quite substantial cost).
I did manage to meet one uncle during the final stages of his life. Understandably, he was very reticent about the events around the time of my adoption, though I do recall vividly the first time he met my own daughter and the obvious emotion he displayed when he recognised the distinct resemblance between her and his deceased sister.
My search brought me to many places in south Carlow to meet families and neighbours who knew my mother and her family. I followed up on some relatives in the USA as well.
One contact was with a first cousin of my mother, by the name of Anna Mae Hays. Her father had emigrated to the USA. She had joined the US Army nursing corps and she eventually became the first woman to reach the rank of General in the US army. She died aged 97 a few months ago.
It has been a fascinating journey of discovery for me that has now gone on for nigh on 50 years. Yet still there are matters that remain closed to me.
Now, following on from this week’s latest bombshell, we need to proceed with a long-promised reform of the law.
We are dealing here with a basic fundamental human right that has been enshrined in different international conventions, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights.
These conventions recognise the right to identity, from which it must follow that there be a guaranteed right to access basic birth information and medical records.
Our laws are quite deficient in protecting the exercise of that right. All attempts to reform the law have come up against entirely unreasonable barriers that do not exist in other societies that have similar legal systems to ours.
A draft bill is now on the Seanad Order Paper dating from 2015. It is currently stalled there. I think the Committee Stage should now proceed to see how some serious flaws in some sections can be remedied.
Some of the procedures listed are excessively cumbersome and could lead an adopted person to feel a sense of intimidation in seeking information.
There is an apparent presumption that privacy protection dominates all other matters. The sections are excessively cautious and could be amended to satisfy the legitimate concerns of those representing adopted people.
There are also excessive requirements about undertakings to be demanded from those engaged in tracing which, I’m sure, can be adjusted by amendments.
I find it extraordinary that, in the years our society has willingly accepted great reforms on marriage equality, gender recognition and now abortion rights, there remains these legal barriers to adoption-tracing rights.
I wonder if adopted people are to be the last in the queue as other great reform and equality issues are dealt with.
That would be a serious injustice.

Byline: Emily Maree
Highlight: From self-driving cars to education for the future of technology, Emily Maree is back with six big questions for six experts 
Body


1. With the news that one of Tesla’s cars crashed at 95kmh while on autopilot, do you think self-driving technology is moving too fast?
2. According to a recent study, students are four times more likely to seek mental health advice from social media than a counsellor. What is your opinion on this?
3. With Ireland becoming a major player in the European tech market, how can we prepare school-age children for their future careers?
4. AIB has been criticised for monitoring customers’ social media accounts. How far do you think companies should be able to look into our online personas?
5. What do you think could be the next defining trend in technology?
6. Name one app you couldn’t live without.
1. Heavy regulation needs to be applied. Google’s car has an impeccable safety record and others trying to keep up are doing so with great urgency. Urgency is the enemy of safety.
2. I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing. It perhaps changes the journey people may go on while seeking help. What is important is the availability of information and signposting to the next steps. The openness of social media can encourage people to seek help and know that it’s okay.
3. A balanced exposure to technology at home as well as in school is hugely important. The philanthropy of Martin Naughton is demonstrative of the importance of investment throughout our education system.
4. I’d say that it’s more than just AIB. Companies are made up of people, as is social media. Natural judgments are made that extend into workplaces. If people choose to make public all their activities, there will inevitably be social consequences.
5. Quantum computing will undoubtedly make real all the current edge technologies like AI, ML, AR, VR. Making all things secure is a real challenge, of course.
6. Audible.
1. With every advancement in technology, it is inevitable there are failures. The technology to self-drive a car is evolving at an admirable pace, but not an acceptably fast one. I feel the fact that these can only be tested in real conditions on the public roads is the challenge, and where the companies are moving dangerously fast. There is no major benefit to autonomous cars other than market advantage for the company that gets it working first, so a regulation of the safety aspect should be increased until there is far more maturity.
2. It’s disappointing to hear, but I’m not surprised that a young person is turning to their peers for advice. Education systems must react to ensure young people are aware of issues with relying on social media for anything other than amusement.
3. Our education system needs to promote a more technology-driven agenda. The areas that children will grow up to work in over the next 15 years may be very different to the skills needed today. The ability to self-learn from a foundation base is important in this regard.
4. If you share the information publicly, then why would you be critical of a company using this information? Once it’s shared online, it is no longer yours and if this helps a company create a persona for risk or any other purpose, then this is simply something people need to live with and also understand. The concepts that the digital footprint we leave can be used to sell positively to us, results in the opposite being also true.
5. VR is very close to being more mainstream
6. Google Maps — I am terrible at directions and get lost easily.
1. If we want to preserve the planet, we have a duty of care to the next generation to challenge ourselves and push the boundaries. I believe Tesla to be a pioneer in technology, but also a company with exceptionally high values on safety.
2. The world is constantly evolving and the current generation of students have grown up in an era where answers to almost everything are at the touch of a screen. I agree social media will win out over counselling, although I don’t agree that it is a progressive step forward.
3. It has to be driven by the decision-makers within the education system and the government. Only they can shape the future syllabus and ensure the right level of funding is put into the education system.
4. With recent events of data protection breaches within social media, I believe companies engaged in this area should be restricted to absolute minimal information.
5. All forms of communication from mobile devices to internet-based solutions. With the revenue value in communication both commercially and consumer driven we can expect to see some major innovation — when it arrives we’ll think it’s life-changing. Add to that voice activation, we will soon start to see this in everything we use in our day-to-day lives.
6. Outlook from a business perspective, and Apple music for that personal headspace.
1. I certainly believe that self-driving cars will be a part of our future as we continue to move in this digital transformation. I do think that further testing of these technologies is required. With the number of fatalities on our roads increasing, hopefully self-driving cars will be able to reduce these numbers in time.
2. It’s great to see children acknowledging the importance of their mental health. In this day and age, our children are more comfortable talking behind a screen than communicating face-to-face. This is something we certainly have to improve on — social media can be a dark place for many people, and the benefits of talking to a qualified counsellor cannot be outweighed.
3. Children are being raised in a technology era, and gone are the days of pen and paper. It’s great to see children being taught on iPads and smartboards. I think a further emphasis needs to be placed on Stem subjects and especially targeted towards the females in this country.
4. At the end of the day, whatever people post on the internet will be there for a lifetime. It’s a warning for all people to be conscious about what they post online. While monitoring people’s social media accounts from a company’s perspective is inappropriate, it’s something I see continuing.
5. The incredible rise of artificial intelligence (AI). I believe we are only scratching the surface within this field of technology.
6. Fitbit.
1. No. It’s a classic case of reporting on that one time it went wrong and magnifying that. Those who resist innovation eventually get left behind.
2. Social media can be used for good. We need to be careful though, as sentiment analysis can be easily abused. Ethics are important.
3. Meta-learning, which means being aware of and taking control of one’s own learning. The world is evolving rapidly, you need to adapt to remain relevant.
4. In recruitment it is mandatory to inform individuals of social media vetting prior to the application. For monitoring I’d question the lawful basis.
5. Privacy as an added service. We are moving into a world where people will be willing to pay for the more private version of a service.
6. Pocket. It allows you to save online articles and read them later. It’s brilliant.
1. I’m looking forward to it being commercialised given how much time I spend in the car, but I do have concerns. I think it’s moving too fast, and with Google, Uber and Tesla all racing to be the first, we could see a rise in these types of incidents.
2. It’s worrying. Social media can be a dangerous place for creating unrealistic expectations, cyberbullying and exclusion; it’s probably a leading cause of the problem. The marketplace for all business has moved so we can’t expect some things to stay traditional. If people are now looking to social media we need to allow them to access professional help through this channel.
3. I think schools are taking some good steps, I did some work with my own secondary school on coding modules, and the technologies like Scratch are great. In my opinion, students should be taught the logic associated with coding and this needs to be led by government initiatives.
4. GDPR is the first step to move the power back into the consumers’ hands. It comes down to privacy settings — if you leave it public, you’re leaving yourself open to be monitored. Businesses should, of course, follow a code of ethics with respect to their customers’ privacy, but consumers can’t rely on this.
5. I think Voice is just about to explode. We’re finally cracking the understanding and intent of humans. With sales of Google’s Home, Apple’s HomePod and Amazon’s Echo skyrocketing, watch this space.
6. I deleted my Facebook app due to privacy and endless scrolling. Instagram has since filled this void, but I couldn’t live without my Todoist. Whether it’s work tasks, personal chores or just my shopping list, I organise my life on it.

Marketing expert urges retailers to think big online

Body


There’s a saying that ‘you can’t hold back the tide’, and when it comes to modern retail it’s imperative that changing technologies and modes of sale, are not just embraced, but further explored and taken advantage of.
Roisin Woods, digital marketing and ecommerce consultant, believes that now is an opportune time for retailers of all sizes to innovate and rethink their business models with a view to their online customer base.
She told The Sunday Business Post: “With 70 per cent of the Irish consumers expected to shop online by 2020, the change is happening, and there is no time to waste for retailers which have yet to embrace digital commerce.”
The key to success in retail is accurately understanding the customer, their needs, shopping habits and changing trends.
“The Irish consumer’s love for shopping online shows no sign of abating with more than €850,000 spent every hour online. While Irish retailers are winning on some aspects, with 24 per cent of online revenue coming from international visitors, there is still much work to be done to circumvent loss to Irish retailers and the revenue commissioner caused by 70 per cent of current online spend going abroad,” said Woods.
For some retailers, though, the shift online is happening too slowly and they’re being outflanked by domestic and international competitors.
Woods said: “While some Irish SME retailers are making progress - with 40 per cent now having transactional websites - the transformation is not occurring fast enough. According to IEDR, the IE Domain Registry, some 69 per cent of consumers say they are frustrated with retailers who do not have a website while 59 per cent report that if they cannot find it online they will move to a competitor.”
An emerging generation of parents and homeowners in Ireland has grown accustomed to purchasing what it needs online. With busy professional and family lives, many see the emergence of online shopping as convenient and essential to help with time management.
“The fact that the millennials are entering parenthood and, as digital natives, are more inclined to research, purchase and engage with brands online than ever before, ensures continued online growth,” said Woods, who was the driving force behind McElhinney’s move online.
She launched the Donegal retailer’s online store in 2012 and was responsible for creating their two-award winning websites some four years later.
She said the ecommerce strategy which is gaining best results is defined into two elements – creating an exceptional customer experience and the correct implementation, optimisation and integration of technology.
“The delivery of an exceptional customer experience online is all about the adoption of retailing basics on the front end of a website. Ensuring the website is optimised on mobile, desktop and tablet so the customer can navigate or search to find the product they need without confusion or delay. The use of product merchandising and smart personalisation software which presents the right products, to the right customer, at the right price and at the right time is essential online.
"There is a pressing need for retailers to rethink their existing supply chain and product procurement strategies to meet consumers' purchasing habits.
Today, Irish retailers are often competing online for the same customers as their suppliers requiring retailers to consider the implementation of lean retailing approaches.
“The checkout should be intuitive, secure and offer multiple payment options. As mobile surpasses desktop in both traffic and revenue in 2018, the convenience of one-click checkout and digital wallet will be a prerequisite. And the post-sale service is now critical when managing customer experience.
"The delivery options should be fast and cost-effective, product returns clearly stated, independent service reviews obtained and when things go wrong a fast and efficient response is essential. The challenge for retailers is using data to drive engagement with both new and existing customers, which ultimately enhances loyalty and lifetime value.
Woods acknowledges that there are some supports available for retailers to help them create and develop a digital presence. However, these incentives need to be more inclusive, as they are often only available to companies of certain sizes and traditional export manufacturing companies, with Irish retailers rarely satisfying the criteria.

The Rose of Jericho
By Alex Martinez
Theatre Upstairs @ Lanigan's Bar, Eden Quay, Dublin
Rating: ***
Runs until June 9
By his own admission, Danny Burns (Kevin Hely) is something of a rough diamond. We first meet this Dublin-born squaddie as he urinates against a wall, explaining that the army was a natural career move for a violent, sexist, poorly educated young man like himself. After years of service in Kosovo and Iraq, however, he has made an important decision – instead of fighting the British government’s battles for them, it is time to start fighting his own.
“Do you know what the difference is between a common criminal and a common soldier?” he asks. “The criminal gets to keep the DVD player. Private Nobody aids and abets the ransacking of a whole nation and goes home empty- handed.”
Alex Martinez wrote The Rose of Jericho for the 2014 Edinburgh Fringe in protest against Britain’s “jingoistic” centenary commemorations of World War I. While his hour-long monologue certainly has a strong political message, it is arguably more effective as a subtle and provocative character study. Swaggering around the stage while eyeballing almost every member of the audience, Hely is a snarling cross between Jimmy Porter from John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger and Begbie from Irvine Welsh’s Trainspotting – a lethal combination if ever there was one.
The title comes from a plant that looks physically tough, but develops into tumbleweed if it does not get enough care and attention. This just about sums up Danny’s love-free Irish childhood, which he recalls as dominated by his father’s tattooed Love/Hate knuckles. Moving in with his English relations offered the opportunity of some sordid sexual escapades, but did not broaden his horizons enough to make him want to do anything more than fighting foreigners for a living.
When the Jericho rose receives even a few drops of water, however, it can blossom into something quite impressive. Danny’s road to enlightenment includes marrying a strong woman and reading Dulce et Decorum est by the Great War poet Wilfrid Owen, which he acts out with surprising sensitivity and tenderness. He also recounts a surreal dream about the Cenotaph in London, leaving him determined to expose the lies that have turned him and his fellow “unknowing soldiers” into pathetic cannon fodder.
Hely was a member of Conor McPherson’s theatre company Fly By Night in the early 1990s, and performed several of McPherson’s monologue plays such as The Good Thief. Here, he shows himself once again to be supremely comfortable in this tricky format, holding the room’s attention with no props other than a packing case and his own denim jacket. Occasionally, he is let down by a script that veers into clichés and ends with a rather unconvincing plot twist.
Overall, however, Martinez’s uncomfortable but bracing tirade is the theatrical equivalent of a cold shower and brings to mind the Duke of Wellington’s famous quote about his troops: “I don’t know what they’ll do to the enemy, but by God they frighten me.”
“Salmon have to go back to where they were spawned,” Gordon Sumner (the artist better known as Sting) quipped during a visit to Dublin last December, while promoting his loosely autobiographical first musical The Last Ship.

The show has had a rocky voyage so far, bombing on Broadway four years ago before being hauled into dry dock for some extensive repairs. Happily, a new book by director Lorne Campbell has received much better reviews, and Sting’s Celtic-tinged soundtrack remains intact in the version about to drop anchor at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre.
The Last Ship is described by its creator as “a thank-you to the city I abandoned as a young man”. Set in 1980s Tyneside, it follows the fortunes of a restless sailor who returns home to find his local shipyard under threat from Thatcherism and encourages the workforce to stage an occupation.
Starring Joe McGann, The Last Ship runs from tomorrow until June 9; tickets at bordgaisenergytheatre.ie.

Meet the woman leading Ireland’s largest landlord

Highlight: Ires has become the state’s largest private landlord almost overnight. Its business is rent, and business is good. But not everyone is happy with the way it does things 
Body


For several years, when the world looked at places like Sandyford, they saw nothing but the stranded skeletons of building projects left abandoned when the economic tide went out. Half-finished apartment buildings, a mish-mash of steel and glass, developers with loans in Nama: the flotsam that remained on the surface after a ship goes down.
But when a Canadian company called Capreit saw it, an opportunity was glimpsed. In the space of a few short months, the Canadians launched a publicly quoted company - Irish Residential Properties Reit (Ires) - and raised and spent hundreds of millions of euro on apartments.
Out of nowhere, Ires became the state’s largest private landlord.
Margaret Sweeney, its chief executive, has hundreds of millions of euro to invest and thousands of properties to manage. Shareholders and analysts must be kept happy too. Thousands of competing tasks to be managed every day. In short, in many ways, she’s just like any other chief executive of a publicly quoted company.
But because of the housing crisis, Ires and other property investors have come to mean much more than most public companies. These outfits, the way they do business and their successes tell a story which encapsulates the competing failures, triumphs, tensions and controversies of the Irish recovery.
For these companies, and for Sweeney, there is no such thing as ordinary. In her first major interview since becoming chief executive last year, she talks rent, politics, building and the future.
Ires is here for one reason: rent.
The revenues generated by people paying for tenancies make for a juicy proposal to the kind of investors that Ires has on its books - pension funds and insurance companies who want nice, safe, boring investments that predictably throw up the same amount of cash every month.
The problem is that those same revenue streams are at the core of one of the most intractable political problems facing Ireland today.
The return of growth has run headlong into a supply problem, with more working people in an expanding economy competing for too few housing units. The result is incredible rental growth. Last month, Daft.ie reported that rents have been rising for 23 quarters in a row, with Dublin rents 87 per cent up from their lowest point, and average rent across the country up 70 per cent. They far exceed their Celtic Tiger peak, by around 30 per cent.
This effect has been reflected in Ires’s finances as well. When it reported results for 2017 earlier this year, the average rent across its portfolio was €1,517; almost 42 per cent higher than its first results just four years ago.
Ires makes a virtue of this when talking to investors, noting in its 2016 annual report that, “fuelled by a sizeable mismatch between supply and demand, rents have reached a new all-time high”. The previous year, it noted that “little supply” was going to come to the market, meaning that the company “continue[s] to see strengthening fundamentals in the residential rental business”.
Most recently, it began to rent one-bedroom apartments in Finglas at €1,500 a month, asking for two months’ rent as deposit and the first month’s rent up front.
It is unavoidably the case that the rental crisis has been good for Ires’s bottom line. But Sweeney rejects any suggestion that what the company builds is unaffordable.
“I think it is [affordable],” she says. “Since I took the job in September, I’ve got myself out and tried to understand the dynamics of what’s happening.”
Of the Finglas apartments, she says: “Affordability should be about 40 per cent of [tenant’s] net income. The view is that there’s quite a significant number of people who can afford them.” She points out that they are ringed by pharmaceutical companies and other FDI employers, and that Ires has already signed up 50 tenants.
“We are standard pricing. We are not excessive at all; we would tend to price by location, [and] look at what is happening locally,” she says. “In an area where there’s a lot of multinational employment, there’s a very different average pay scale.”
Some tenants have a different view.
One former Ires tenant, who used to rent an apartment a hundred yards from where Sweeney is sitting in the company’s Sandyford office, told The Sunday Business Post that her rent increased from €1,050 to around €1,400 before she had to leave Sandyford. She says she now lives, with her partner and child, in an undersized and unsuitable apartment. Ires, she told The Sunday Business Post, “doesn’t care”.
So, does Ires care or not?
“I do, a lot,” says Sweeney. “Ultimately, I think that’s what our business is. It’s people. Every day, across 2,500 apartments, we have close to 5,000 people living in them. That’s the type of company I’d like us to be.”
But do they care if people are forced out of their units by higher rents?
“To a large extent, for a lot of people it is about affordability, in terms of within their particular circumstances. I would hope across the range of our portfolio we can actually service people,” Sweeney says.
For Sweeney, the problem stems from supply. “I have huge sympathy for people looking for accommodation. We don’t have enough built. And we need to ramp up the building side,” she says.
“I think the challenge in the market is, for ten years we didn’t build anything, and within that we had the population growing, even during the recession.”
Ires is a key part of helping with supply, she argues, by the cash it raises from international investors into building and upgrading apartments, as well as providing a sorely-needed income stream to builders who it pre-purchases houses and apartments from.
Ires, she says, is part of a transition to a more sustainable, more professional building and rental sector. “We’ve come from a debt-based builder system, and now we’re a sector that is underpinned by long-term investment, sustainable capital coming into it from pension funds, insurance companies and international investors,” she says. “I would like to shift from the landlord/tenant relationship, a very old model we’ve had in Ireland.”
She wants a professional, transparent sector which will efficiently manage international capital into Ireland and provide a good service to tenants. “I think that will improve the country.”
The truth is that companies like Ires are inevitably part of the solution to Ireland’s housing crisis. The question is: in such a charged environment, can they survive contact with the problem?
Companies like Ires get political. It’s unavoidable when they marshal hundreds of millions from financial markets into regulated sectors that the public and voters are interested in. And this company is no exception.
Ires has never been shy of telling the government what it thinks. In early 2015, when the then environment minister Alan Kelly was publicly mulling a cap on rent increases to the rate of inflation, the then Ires chief executive David Ehrlich told this newspaper: “Now is not the time to bring in rent control. If you brought in rent control, what limited construction is happening in new homes would stop. You can’t make the numbers work if you’re going to add on that kind of an increase. The math just doesn’t work to construct.”
Kelly eventually got a watered-down version of rent control, banning rent reviews for two years. Before this expired, Simon Coveney introduced the Rent Pressure Zone regime, which barred increases by more than 4 per cent in certain areas. Ehrlich said at the time that the move was “poorly timed” and left investors feeling “burned”.
Despite the temporary nature of the RPZ regime (which expires after three years), Ehrlich - who recently cleared a profit of €4 million when selling down his Ires shareholding, in a move that even aroused the anger of its own shareholders - grumbled: “The government has said that this is a three-year measure. In the US, income tax was introduced as a temporary measure to finance World War I.”
It is perhaps surprising, then, that his successor seems to value the predictability of the RPZs over further unknown interventions in the rental market. Without explicitly praising the measure, or calling for it to be extended, Sweeney says that the RPZ regime has worked: “I think it has, in the sense that it has taken a lot of heat out of the market.”
Sweeney predicts that existing rents in Ires apartments will rise by around the 4 per cent limit every year, but the average rent is likely to increase by more due to the addition of new units, which are allowed to “mark to market”, and aren’t bound by the RPZs at their first letting. The average rent across the Ires portfolio increased by 6.3 per cent in 2017.
“Haphazard” interventions, she says, are “not good”.
“It’s better that the whole sector as well is well structured, well measured and steady, and we don’t have ad hoc stuff happening in relation to it.”
It’s easy to understand why Sweeney is concerned. In a charged environment where voters are increasingly - and legitimately - furious about affordability in the rental sector, the likelihood of an ambitious minister bullyfooting their way into the sector with far-reaching reforms is higher.
She’s understandably nice about current housing minister Eoghan Murphy (“He has a very difficult job”) without being drawn on his counterparts in Sinn Féin or Fianna Fáil and their policy prescriptions.
But, in truth, Ires and its colleagues in the property sector seem to be quite effective at getting the political system to listen to them.
Ires was among a whole host of property investors that kept up a relentless lobbying campaign over building regulations for apartment sizes, as well as other issues like dual aspect apartments and mandatory car parking spaces.
In a letter to Murphy last year after an investor roadshow, Ires told him that its investors were “struggling to understand why the Irish planning system continues to frustrate and impede rapid delivery of residential developments”.
It said that lowering building standards for apartments would, “in many cases, make the difference in a project being viable or otherwise”. It promised that, with relaxed regulations, it could deliver apartments at its flagship Rockbrook scheme for €70,000 less, which would in turn alleviate affordability issues.
Returns on the lobbying register show that Ires and others were not shy about asserting their views on the Residential and Tenancies Act, on planning regulations, on building design guidelines. One meeting with Murphy over the heights of residential buildings was not minuted. But shortly afterwards, the housing minister confirmed that he wanted to re-examine the issue.
Last December, Murphy announced a series of reforms that closely reflected what Ires and others in the sector had been asking for. Does this mean that their lobbying worked?
“I would say it’s more to do with the work that the Department of Housing has done,” says Sweeney, “along with a significant number of groups right across the sector, whether it’s private, rented, social housing, looking at the sector in Ireland and saying how do we accommodate a growing population in urban areas.”
This thesis permeates Ires’s argument: that Ireland is unprepared from a regulatory point of view for a future in which closer to 40 per cent of city dwellers will live in private rented apartments. Regulations here, Sweeney says, are “like we’ve squashed the design for three-bedroom semi-detached houses into becoming apartments, instead of looking at them as people are going to be living in them through different parts of their life cycle, designing for that”.
The vision is for people to cycle from student accommodation, through studios, one beds, up to larger apartments meant for family homes. Ires says it plans to provide solutions at all these levels.
Sweeney also speaks of “challenges and frustrations” with the planning system. This isn’t surprising, as the company’s flagship Rockbrook scheme of almost 500 apartments has been repeatedly sent back to the drawing board. Still without planning, the scheme was supposed to be in construction by now.
Despite recent reforms, Sweeney is still pushing for more freedom for developers to define what they anticipate the market wants, as opposed to being told what to build, singling out the requirement for apartments to have balconies.
“The requirement for balconies makes no sense, on an island where the wind is blowing,” she says. “I look at apartments with empty balconies every day when I walk up Pearse Street, and I see nobody on them, or on Grand Canal Square, nobody on them other than smoking.”
When it comes to enjoying fresh air, she suggests that “people go to the beach; we live on an island . . . we have nice parks”.
The problem is that people - especially renters - become increasingly nervous about this kind of rhetoric. While to the industry there is an irresistible logic in reform, others just see large landlords calling for looser regulations and smaller apartment sizes.
Sweeney rejects the idea that Ires is lowering standards, pointing out that the company plans to deliver a variety of apartment sizes suited to people in different stages of their lives.
“We definitely don’t, as a culture in the company, have a desire for low standards,” she says. “We would like to make sure we’re building for the future for this generation, for the next generation. We want to make sure that it meets their needs and their requirements.”
Nonetheless, the ghost of Liam Carroll’s apartment developments, the show units of which were stocked with smaller furniture in order to make them seem bigger, still looms large. An increasingly vocal cohort of renters, academics, experts and politicians are throwing down the gauntlet to the construction lobby plans, galvanised by more recent reforms such as the development of ‘build to rent’ apartments, which will allow whole apartment blocks of the same size unit to be built.
Those who say they want to build for the rental sector, and those who live in that same sector, appear to be heading for a collision. Navigating this increasingly fraught terrain will be another challenge for Sweeney.
Ires’s share price has not scaled the heights of its contemporaries in the Irish Reit sector, but nonetheless remains a broker favourite. Sweeney knows that she has to keep showing investors positive momentum to stay in their good books.
“Our plan is growth and investment. We’re a relatively new company, only four years old. Our investors would expect us to grow, that is the ambition of the company,” she says.
To that end, Ires is planning more acquisitions - but, knowing that the pipeline of major asset sales from Nama and other deleveraging financial institutions is likely to dry up, it is also planning other ways of bringing new units on stream.
New units, it must be remembered, aren’t subject to RPZ restrictions on their first letting, and therefore provide an adrenalin shot to the company’s finances.
Six hundred apartments will go into planning in the near future across three developments, while Ires is also looking outside Dublin for growth, with Cork a likely next location.
Sweeney is considering more forward funding deals with cash-strapped builders, paying cash up front for houses and apartments, which allows builders to fund development.
What is clear is that, in principle, a well-funded, professional landlord which plans to build to meet desperate supply shortages is to be welcomed. But as the Irish housing market continues to roll on stormy seas, Ires will be judged as a major player in whatever successes - or failures - are to come.

Michael D Higgins the star of portrait collection

Highlight: President takes his place in cultural icons gallery
Body


A new portrait of President Michael D Higgins has been unveiled at Farmleigh Gallery and is published today for the first time in The Sunday Business Post.
The painting, by renowned Anglo-Belgian artist Anthony Palliser, is one of over 80 portraits of Irish cultural icons that form the Face To Face exhibition, which “celebrates individuals who have contributed significantly to the development of Irish cultural life and its international reputation and appreciation”.
Sitters include Edna O’Brien, Brendan Gleeson, Sinead Cusack and Seamus Heaney. The exhibition was the brainchild of late Claddagh Records founder Garech Browne, who facilitated Palliser’s artistic process.
Anthony Palliser told The Sunday Business Post: “I first met the President at Garech Browne’s house, Luggala, in the summer of 2016. I had written to the President to tell him how much I admired his work and to say I would be honoured if I could paint his portrait for my Irish collection.
“Garech being Garech, he made the connection happen. Lunch with the President at Luggala was organised, which my wife Diane cooked. We had a wonderful afternoon of music and conversation. In fact, we even carried the dining room table outside and one of the musician’s daughters performed an Irish dance on top of it.
“I later spent a couple of hours with the President alone in the drawing room at Luggala, and took his photograph, which I used to create his portrait. It’s very fitting that the President’s portrait is displayed for the first time in the Farmleigh Gallery at the Phoenix Park.
“It’s a great honour to bring the Irish collection together for the first time in Ireland, and to do so at Farmleigh, which has such a personal connection for Garech and the Guinness family.”
Face To Face, Anthony Palliser’s Irish Portraits exhibition, is at the Farmleigh Gallery until September 2. Admission is free.

Highlight: Here, in an exclusive extract, the playwright recalls the immediate aftermath of a nervous breakdown, and his transfer to a mental institution. This, reader, is not for the faint of heart 
Body


There are two RUC men, and they put me in the back of their car and drive me to the police station nearby. Watching the back of their heads, how they glance at each other now and then, and then at me in the rear-view mirror, I begin to calm, and want to chat with these two saviours of mine.
“Do you have families?” I ask them.
“Oh, aye, we have families,” says one of the officers after a moment, looking over at his companion; he’s conscious of my southern accent, my Dublin-registered car.
“Families are important,” I pronounce solemnly. “You have to take care of your families.”
Again the glances go back and forth. One of them smiles. “Aye,” he says. “We’ll look after our families.” We drive on.
In the RUC station a blanket is thrown over my shivering shoulders while the officers make phone calls, trying to figure me out and what to do with me. Eventually, they drive me a short distance to the Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital. Outside a single-storey unit, two people wait for me, dressed in white: nurses. They bring me inside. I feel nothing but exhaustion now.
“Can I sleep a while?” I ask the nurses.
“First you see the registrar,” one of them says.
Waiting for the registrar in a small, plain office, I struggle to stay awake. The door opens and a middle-aged woman enters. “I just need to sleep,” I tell her. “If you could just let me sleep tonight. I haven’t slept in so long.”
“This first,” she says, tapping her clipboard. “Sleep later.”
I sink back in my chair. “Now,” she goes on, “how did you get here?”
“Night. Driving. The road, just driving at night. No sleep.” I am slurring.
“Pardon?” she says.
“I was at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre,” I sigh. “The artists’ residency, you know? I got kicked out at 3am today.”
“Why?”
“I was knocking at the door of the bedroom of a girl there, an artist.” I don’t mention that I was brandishing a hunting knife at the time. “Please – I haven’t slept in four weeks.”
[caption id="attachment_417735" align="alignleft" width="599"] Arnold Thomas Fanning[/caption]
“First I will see are you to be admitted,” she says, scribbling her notes.
“How do you feel now?”
“Depressed,” I admit.
“Any thoughts of suicide?”
“No.”
“What date is it?” she asks now.
“About – about the tenth of March, 1998. I just saw a newspaper yesterday, at least I think it was yesterday, so –”
“The place?”
“In a hospital, apparently, somewhere up North.” “What country, please?”
“That’s a moot point.”
Definitely on fire with the comebacks. But she is not impressed. More note-taking.
“Does anyone know where you are?”
“No one knows where I am. Except you, me and the police.” My eyes are drooping again; my body is giving up, even as my mind is surging forward. My leg is now out of control under the table. I want to jump up now and go. But go where? To sleep? To the car?
“Now, remember three things I tell you. Pen, table, head.” “Easy. Pen, table, head.”
“Not for now. Later.”
“Okay.”
“Count the numbers backwards from one hundred, like this: a hundred, ninety-three, eighty-six, seventy-nine. Yes?”
“I can do that. A hundred. Ninety-three. Eighty-six. Seventy-nine. Uh ‒ Seventy. No. Uh ‒” The numbers seem within reach but impossible to grasp. “No, wait. Seventy-two! Seventy-two, sixty-five, sixty-five, uh ‒” Suddenly I need to leave, to get moving. “Look,”I tell the doctor, leaning forward. “If you just give me some money, I’ll get petrol for my car and I’ll go, I’ll just go.”
“First you want in, then you want out.”
“I don’t need any treatment,” I tell her, afraid of what could be done to me here. “I just need to rest a bit and then I’ll be fine to go on my way.”
“We will decide what treatment you need.”
“I don’t want ECT. Do you have ECT here?”
“We will decide,” she repeats. “The day the patient gets to decide their own treatment –” She doesn’t finish the thought.
“Am I a patient?”
“That is what I am trying to decide,” she tells me. “So, back to this.”
Sagging back into my seat, I wait as she returns to the questionnaire.
“Now,” she says, “what are the three things I asked you to remember?”
I stare at her blankly. “Fuck it,” I say. “You got me at last.”
The nurses take charge of me for the rest of my processing. Two male nurses in white uniforms: bluff, blunt men. They offer me tea and biscuits, but now I suddenly just want to sleep again, as soon as possible, exhaustion flooding over me, so they bring me to my bed. It is in a row of metal-framed cots in a shared ward.
They pull a curtain around the bed, get me to empty my pockets and undress, to hand over everything to them. They give me flimsy hospital pyjamas. They take my temperature and pulse, listen to my breathing, check my blood pressure. All of this agitates me, even while I long for sleep. My impatience is growing, making me jittery again, invigorating me strangely.
Medication is brought, green liquid in a small plastic beaker.
“I don’t need that,” I tell them.
“It will help you sleep,” says one of the nurses.
“It’s funny, I don’t feel like sleeping now,” I tell them. “I feel wide awake.” And it is true, now I feel alert and energised again, my mind racing.
The nurses glance at one another, then they move as one, pin me down on the bed. One of them pushes my head back and opens my mouth while the other forces the green liquid down my throat. The plastic bites my nose and lip. I splutter and swallow.
“Fuck it,” I say, coughing. “That hurt.”
They stand back and watch me as the drowsiness hits. Beside the bed on a cabinet are a toothbrush, a tube of paste, a wooden hairbrush. Each item is stamped ‘Property of hospital’. The pyjamas I wear bear the same legend.
I lie back on the bed and sleep overcomes me, darkness dropping like blackest night.
Then I awake, and I am in a new white world, hot and airless.
I am restless, unable to stay still. Pacing the corridors all day, up and down, despite the attempts of nurses to get me to settle. The duty medical officer is called and I am given pills to take; I do not know what the pills are, just take them dutifully, hopefully. But still I can’t settle, and when I talk, it is in urgent bursts of speech.
“What’s the matter, Arnold?” asks one of the nurses.
“I’m scared of the other patients.”
“There’s nothing to be scared of.”
“They want to take my notebook off me, and it’s important. It has all my notes, my theories about language. That stuff is important, vital.”
“No one is going to take your notebook.”
“They could attack me or anything and you wouldn’t be able to do a thing about it.”
“They won’t attack you. Why don’t you go have your lunch now?”
Being told to calm down, not having my fears addressed, causes me to snap. Turning away from the nurse, I prance down the corridor, shouting as loudly as I can as I do so: “Give me the ECT!”
The nurses just observe all this and wait for me to burn out. When I’ve stopped shouting they reassure me that there will be no ECT and that I am safe.
The circulating incumbents of the ward, who walk aimlessly around all day when they are not sitting staring at nothing very much, regularly rouse themselves and form an orderly line at a doorway in the corridor. No signal has been made, but somehow the patients know it is time. The top half of the door opens. The lower half acts as a counter over which medication is dispensed. A forearm dressed in white, a hand holding out a plastic phial, followed by a longed-for drink of water to down the required dose of medication, under observation.
The newest arrivals to the hospital refer to the drugs being dispensed as “medicine”. Those incumbent a little longer use the more formal term, “medication”. Those who have been in the system quite a while, the old hands, refer to them as “meds”.
“You got to take your meds.”
“Did you take your meds?”
“They’re giving out meds.”
The heat in the ward is unbearable, my hands sweat constantly, so I frequently ask to go to the toilet to wash my hands and complain to the nurse about the temperature.
“You’re just making us hot in here so as to keep us all drowsy and compliant,” I accuse them. Water is coveted. I am always thirsty, dry-mouthed, asking constantly for glasses of water; there is no font or source of water available, and the nurses seem to resent the bother of having to go and get me some.
It is an all-male ward. My theory is that all the other patients are ex-loyalist terrorists who have been spirited away to this hospital, interned without trial as it were, and drugged up to forget their fate, their histories, their very identities. If they do remember who they are, and realise I am from the South, then I could become a target for sectarian violence.
As I go around the ward I feel their eyes on me. In an empty room while I practise my t’ai chi I become aware of them staring in at me through the small meshed window in the door and become scared and self-conscious; now they will think of me as a martial arts expert, even more of a threat. So I take to carrying an improvised weapon at all times to defend myself: a toothbrush I hold in my fist, around which I wrap a towel: my sword and shield.
One patient called Ed, a huge, lumbering man, gets to catching my eye then fixing me in a stare. He scares me: what is he looking for in my eyes, and what will he do when he finds it? Afraid, I manage to rush out of the ward, out past the reception desk and into the car park, still in my pyjamas, and there I shout at the nurses through an open window. They stand in the ward inside and watch me, wait patiently for me to return, listen as I voice my fears, accuse them of not helping me. Finally, they persuade me to abandon my protest and come inside, and then I explain to them what is wrong.
“There’s one guy keeps looking at me,” I tell them, “I’m scared of him.”
The nurses glance at each other when I identify who it is and immediately decide to take me to a different ward in a different wing of the hospital.
“That guy Ed you were talking about, who you said was looking at you?” says the nurse.
“Yeah?”
“It’s better you don’t share the same space as him any more.”
They bring me to a small, square room that is lined and floored with blue plastic foam: a genuine padded cell. The sight of it, its confined dimensions, makes me baulk, and I refuse to go in. The two nurses force themselves against me and I push back harder, making them shove and then punch me until I am propelled inside and they shut the door behind me.
They watch me through the window in the door as I lie on the plastic floor and cry: debased, humiliated, powerless and afraid.

You know summer has arrived when you have to circle the block four times before getting a parking space in Monkstown. There were hordes of families heading for the seafront as we drove towards Bresson, so much so that we wondered if we’d be the only ones in there.
We weren’t: a table of four ladies were already ensconced on the small but very nice outdoor terrace when we arrived, and there were a few indoor tables occupied. They all seemed to be eating from an early bird menu that, according to the website, is available every evening from 5pm, and that costs €29 for two courses and €35 for three.
There’s no indication on the website of what time this menu is served until, but as we weren’t given a copy for our 7pm booking, presumably it’s before then. I mention it here because if you don’t opt for it, dinner could set you back quite a bit - starters are €10 to €18, mains from €22 to €36, and afters from €8 to €14.50. That’s pretty steep for a neighbourhood restaurant, even if this particular neighbourhood is a swanky one.
The weather meant that we stuck to light choices; coincidentally, for me that meant the cheapest starter and main course on the menu. The former was a great Roquefort and pear salad (€10) dressed with a lovely honey and mustard vinaigrette, heritage beets and lightly spiced walnuts. I’m easily pleased when it comes to Roquefort (I’d order a dish which included it any day of the week), but this one was particularly nice.
My main course, however, was anything but. It sounded very nice – chargrilled salt-baked celeriac and hazelnut dukkah served with a cocoa bean cassoulet, salsa verde and Swiss chard (€22) – but there were so many issues with the cooking that I almost lost count.
The two lumps of celeriac were undercooked to the point of being almost raw in the middle, and looked like they’d never been next nor near a chargrill. Two quenelles of salsa verde were so salty that I winced every time I took a mouthful.
There were a few bits of hazelnut on the plate, but I couldn’t get any hint of the lovely warmth that this Egyptian spice blend usually brings to a dish, and the (undercooked) cassoulet included bits of preserved lemon that were unpleasantly bitter.
My guest was having a similarly up-and-down experience, with a great starter - devilled lambs’ kidneys with Café de Paris butter, a little cassoulet of petits pois and split peas, and some ventreche ham (€14.50) - followed by a disappointing main course in the shape of the fish special, plaice with new potatoes, samphire and a lemon butter (€22). The garnishes were fine, but the fish itself had been so undercooked that it should never have made it out of the kitchen.
We’d ordered two side dishes at €4.50 each: a very tasty pot of choucroute (if you haven’t had it, you should; it’s basically Alsatian sauerkraut and is really delicious), and a small bowl of barely-dressed green salad leaves that I can only describe as outrageously overpriced. Dessert comprised a small but tasty crème brûlée (€8.50) for me, and a disappointing tarte tatin with undercooked lumps of apple and a soggy pastry bottom (€10) for him.
Along with two bottles of sparkling water, one cocktail (an excellent concoction of Dingle Gin, Cointreau, basil, lemon and egg white for €13) and two glasses of wine, our bill came to €135.50. Knock off the cocktail and the water, and we still would have paid €113.50 for a meal that had way more misses than hits.
I’m at a loss as to what has happened at Bresson since it opened amid a slew of positive reviews a few months back. The room itself is gorgeous - it’s basically your dream Parisian bistro made flesh - and the service from the friendly staff is excellent. But on this occasion, neither could make up for what we’d been served, and that is a real pity.
Starter: Limousin veal sweetbreads with a frisée aux lardons salad, Bramley apple and veal jus, €18
Main course: grilled 8oz Irish Hereford fillet steak à la Bourguignonne with sautéed spinach and pommes purées, €36
Dessert: dark chocolate fondant with salt caramel and crème fraîche ice cream, €12
Wine: Echo de Lynch-Bages, Pauillac 2011, €99
Dinner for two: €231
Starter: Roquefort and Conference pear salad with heritage beets, spiced walnuts and a honey and wholegrain mustard vinaigrette, €10
Main course: Coquilles St Jacques, gratinated Kilkeel scallops in the half shell with a chaudrée of brown shrimp, smoked haddock and Alsace bacon, white wine, leeks and pommes purées with Gruyère cheese, €24
Dessert: crème glacée, selection of homemade ice creams, €8
Wine: Cantina di Negrar, Bianco di Custoza, Veneto 2016, €31
Dinner for two: €115
The list here bursts with joyous, heroic selections from almost all of Ireland’s cutting-edge importers. It includes 28 wines by the glass from €6.75 and a dozen wines in the undervalued half-bottle format including the excellent Château Turcaud, Blanc 2014 at €21.
The strong sparkling selection is excellent, from €39 for the Ca Morlin Prosecco to €310 for the rare Pol Roger Cuvée Winston Churchill 2004. There are 43 wines under €50, starting from €27 for the Torre del Falasco, Garganega, Vento 2016, but there are starrier wines if required, all the way up to Château d’Yquem Sauternes 2005 at €475.
Our red pick is Rafael López de Heredia, Viña Cubillo Crianza 2006 at €47, and our white is the superb Birgit Eichinger, Grüner Veltliner Strass, Austria 2016 at €40.

More than 50% of adults found No campaign advertising ‘inappropriate’

Body


A study on the effectiveness of advertising during the referendum on the Eighth Amendment shows that 54 per cent of Irish adults felt that the advertising by the No campaign was inappropriate. This compared to the 24 per cent who found the Yes advertising inappropriate, according to research from media agency MediaCom.
Coyne Research carried out the research for Mediacom using its nationally representative online survey of 1,000 adults aged over 18 between May 23 and May 29.
Young people aged between 18 and 24 (60 per cent) were most likely to find the No campaign inappropriate. Those aged 55+ (30 per cent) were most likely to refer to the Yes campaign as being inappropriate.
The study found that 45 per cent of adults said that the Yes campaign was appropriate while 18 per cent said the No campaign was appropriate.
Ian McGrath, managing director of MediaCom, said the referendum provided a good opportunity to gauge the public mood towards advertising that is beyond typical brand-related activity. He said: “Our research shows that in the eyes of many people, lines were crossed by some of the content and claims made by both camps. However, the Yes activity was felt to be more acceptable to the majority of voters and the work done by the Referendum Commission was also highly credited.”
The Yes campaign provided the clearest communication on the referendum, followed by the Referendum Commission, according to the research. Those aged 18-34 were much more likely to cite the Yes campaign, while those aged over 55 were much more likely to credit the Referendum Commission.

Most firms not ready for data access requests under GDPR

Body


New research by business services firm BSI has found that over half of European organisations have no fixed method in place for responding to Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs).
The research, carried out by the Cybersecurity and Information Resilience division of BSI, in helping organisations prepare for the GDPR, also highlighted that a third of European businesses rate themselves as highly likely to receive a DSAR.
A DSAR is the legal mechanism which allows European citizens to obtain a full account of all personal data an organisation holds on them, an explanation as to why this information is being held, and copies of this data should they wish.
The study found that 58 per cent of all European businesses are unprepared to deal with DSARs.
“The resources required to undertake a DSAR can be considerable, and shouldn’t be underestimated.
Organisations will be expected to wade through huge volumes of data within the reduced one-month window stipulated by the GDPR,” said Stephen O’Boyle, head of professional services at BSI.
“The motive behind DSARs is not always clear, but the end result may include significant costs in responding in terms of resources, and the risk of a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner if your handling of a request falls short.
Preparation is key and organisations which have a structured plan in place and which consider additional supports to aid it, such as additional technology and staff awareness training, will reduce the risk of non-compliance in responding to a DSAR.”

National Concert Hall to fall silent for two years of refurbishment works

Highlight: It is likely that the hall, located on Earlsfort Terrace and backing onto the Iveagh Gardens, will be closed in either 2021 or 2022 for about two years
Body


The National Concert Hall will close for at least two years to allow for a substantial refurbishment of its main auditorium.
“The hall was opened in 1981 so by the time we close for refurbishment it will already be 40 years old,” said its chief executive, Simon Taylor. “We want to make sure that the work we do now takes us through for another 40 years.”
It is likely that the hall, located on Earlsfort Terrace and backing onto the Iveagh Gardens, will be closed in either 2021 or 2022 for about two years.
“It has to be closed. There is no way we can do the scale of work that we need to do without a period of closure which will certainly be two years,” Taylor said. “Obviously, there is no comparable venue that you can just uproot and drop everything into, so we will be looking at a range of different things. That in itself presents a great opportunity because it means we can look at taking what we do to different parts of the city and the country, so in a way it is putting an emphasis on the national.”
The government has allocated €78 million for the redevelopment of the NCH over the next ten years. The NCH developed an outline plan with the Office of Public Works which includes a complete refurbishment of the existing hall, a rehearsal space for the orchestra, a smaller auditorium, more education spaces and improvements to public spaces and backstage and artists’ facilities.
It will now develop those outline plans into full-scale designs. It will apply for planning permission within 18 months with potential construction targeted in three to four years’ time.
“We will have to phase the construction project to some extent, but in order to make sure that we have a clear line of sight of the whole project, the design and planning permission will be completed all together,” he said.
The NCH identified three phases of work, including refurbishment of certain parts of the building, then closure of the main auditorium to completely refurbish it, and finally a new build of a 500-seat auditorium and education spaces.
The third phase, the new auditorium, is not included in the current capital funding.
“We are acutely aware that there are other cultural institutions that need to be looked after as well. The level of investment committed to all the cultural institutions at the moment is very substantial, so we can’t be greedy,” Taylor said.
He said the NCH would seek alternative sources of funding for the new auditorium. It does not have a solid figure on how much it will cost yet, as the design has not been finalised, but it will run into multimillions of euro.
The state’s €78 million accounts for about 70 per cent of the funding needed for the overall project.
Taylor said he would like to secure funding from corporate sponsors to build the new auditorium. “There isn’t a huge tradition in this country of that high level of corporate philanthropy, but you’d like to think that as the economy is really improving, that there might be companies that would see that as a substantial investment.”
It might attract corporate support for the new auditorium through offering naming rights. Taylor said that while the National Concert Hall itself would not sell its naming rights, individual venues within it could.

Nervy times for FF as the post-Repeal dust settles

Highlight: The emphatic overturning of the Eighth Amendment has left many Fianna Fáilers feeling that their party is hugely out of step with the prevailing national mood 
Body


A year ago this weekend, Leo Varadkar was being told by at least one confidante that Simon Harris, who had backed Simon Coveney for the Fine Gael leadership, should be sacked from cabinet. The Taoiseach-elect was told that the Minister for Health could not be trusted following a fractious campaign that had been rife with briefing and counter-briefing.
Varadkar ignored the advice, kept Harris in Health, and entrusted him with responsibility for delivering a referendum on abortion. Twelve months later, on the day that the repeal of the Eighth Amendment was confirmed, the Taoiseach and his minister dined together at BóBó’s burger restaurant on Dame Street before heading to Dublin Castle for a celebration that Varadkar had earlier cautioned against.
Later that night, Varadkar, Harris and a small coterie of ministers and advisers were again spotted dining together at the Temple Bar eatery Elephant & Castle. It served as an example of how transient politics can be where rivals can quickly become allies and share in the spoils of victory. Politically, both Varadkar and Harris drew the plaudits last weekend and throughout last week, but they both know this will not last long; nor is it likely to have a major impact on the outcome of the next general election.
As Yes campaigners were keen to remind people in the aftermath of the referendum, it was not the politicians who delivered the win. Instead, it was a largely non-political grassroots movement which canvassed the country and found an increasingly socially liberal electorate ready to vote for change in Irish abortion laws.
But there would not have been a referendum without the politicians. Nor can the will of the people be implemented without their considerable input in the months ahead. As moves to legislate for abortion gathered pace last week, TDs and senators were also grappling with the political ramifications of the result for their parties and their own careers.
Much of the focus on the political fallout from the referendum centred on Fianna Fáil last week as frontbench TDs like Barry Cowen led calls for a whip to be imposed on the abortion legislation vote. The call was at odds with the party’s six-year-old policy of allowing a free vote on the issue which meant a majority of its TDs and senators could advocate for a No vote in the referendum.
That the public went in the opposite direction has caused a lot of angst among some in the party. They worry that the landslide Yes victory demonstrates how out of touch Fianna Fáilers are with the electorate, and that a male and stale party has missed the social revolution.
“It’s not great that so many were out of sync with the electorate. I do think people need to take stock of that and reassess their own constituency,” said Kildare North TD James Lawless, who switched from a No to a Yes vote in the final days of the campaign.
The split in the party over abortion was no more evident than when dozens of TDs and senators appeared in a photo calling for a No vote, while its leader Micheál Martin and the likes of Timmy Dooley and Billy Kelleher were out canvassing for the other side.
“I have no problem with people individually campaigning, but working in a block goes a little bit against the grain of freedom of conscience. That was probably pushing the boundaries a bit,” Lawless said of the now infamous picture.
Martin has insisted the whip will not be imposed, but believes there is an “obligation” on his TDs and senators to support the will of the people, a fact he is impressing on them in individual meetings. Most TDs have signalled they are happy to do this. Others even have regrets about how it all panned out, with one TD, who declined to be named, claiming that two of his colleagues told him they had voted Yes despite publicly saying they were on the No side.
Roscommon-Galway TD Eugene Murphy said his biggest mistake in politics had been to vote against the holding of a referendum back in March. “It came from inexperience,” he said.
Former deputy leader Éamon Ó Cuív publicly campaigned for a No vote and is now holding out on supporting the legislation. “When I see it, I’ll talk about it. How can you have a position when it’s not published? I can’t speak for my colleagues. I am very into good administration and process. We have to wait and see the legislation,” he said.
Bobby Aylward said he would not oppose or obstruct the bill and, while he is waiting to see the legislation, he said he would “probably be abstaining”. Finance spokesman Michael McGrath said he was waiting to see the legislation, but insisted he would not stand in its way.
Most Fianna Fáil TDs who backed a No vote insisted last week they did so not for political gain, but because of their own deeply held views on the issue. “Most public representatives had a genuine view and reflected that,” said one TD who declined to be named. “People had a view and were comfortable saying that, but this wasn’t a case of playing a [political] game around the issue.”
Another senior TD said: “I don’t like any inference that some people on the No side made a calculation that in some way it was in their interest to vote No. That would be a fairly bizarre calculation to make, given the majority in every poll were saying they were Yes.”
But the active campaigns on both sides served to create an image of a party divided and now grappling with being out of touch with the electorate. By contrast, Fine Gael TDs and senators who supported a No vote were largely silent during the campaign. In effect, Fine Gael as a party supported repeal, while allowing individual members a conscientious opt-out.
Now many No-voting Fine Gael-ers are signalling they’ll back the legislation, although veteran senator Paul Coghlan said he would listen to colleagues and take advice. “The jury is out, you know my view. I have been opposed to the ending of human life by deliberate means,” he said. His Seanad colleague John O’Mahony also said he would “wait and see” about the legislation.
Others who never declared one way or the other during the campaign say they voted Yes, including Clare TD Joe Carey.
Former finance minister Michael Noonan said he never had any problem with the issue. “I haven’t spoken about any issue since I stepped down as minister, and it was a continuation of not being a backseat driver. That was the issue rather than any problem with the proposal,” he told The Sunday Business Post. “I am telling you now that I will be supporting the legislation in full.”
The Taoiseach reiterated at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting last week that there will be a free vote on the legislation.
No such freedoms will apply in Sinn Féin, which is to hold an ard fheis in less than a fortnight to allow members decide whether to further liberalise its abortion policy, in order to allow TDs to back the government’s proposals. It will be a fait accompli, given the vigorous campaigning of leader Mary Lou McDonald during the referendum.
But there will be significant fallout for TDs Peadar Tóibín and Carol Nolan, who both actively campaigned for a No vote. Nolan is currently suspended from the party until later this month. She signalled last week that she may not return at all, given she will be opposing the abortion legislation when it comes before the Dáil in July.
One senior Sinn Féin source admitted it was likely Nolan would quit the party altogether and she cut an isolated figure last week, sitting alongside the Social Democrats in the Dáil chamber.
What happens with Tóibín is unclear. He is to table a motion calling for a free vote at the ard fheis, but this is likely to be defeated, as it has in previous ard fheiseanna. He expects another six-month suspension from the party when he almost certainly votes against the legislation. But Sinn Féin has privately indicated the penalty could be more severe, given this will be the second time he has opposed the party on abortion.
There is also little goodwill towards Tóibín in Sinn Féin, after he appeared on the RTÉ Prime Time debate arguing against party policy. The timing and length of any suspension for Tóibín will dictate his future. If an election is called while he is suspended from the party, then Sinn Féin will have to find a new candidate in Meath West and Tóibín will run as an independent.
Other parties are hoping to benefit from the referendum campaign, not least the Social Democrats, which last week announced four new candidates in Dublin, all of whom were involved in the repeal effort. These are Carly Bailey in Dublin South-West, Sarah Durcan in Dublin Bay South, Sinead Gibney in Dún Laoghaire and Tracey Carey-Archer in Fingal.
The referendum energised a whole generation of young voters, particularly women, and all parties will now attempt to harness this new and energised electorate for political gain at the next election. On past experience, however, this will be hard to do.
After the same-sex marriage referendum three years ago, Fianna Fáil was in turmoil over a lacklustre campaign which saw many of its TDs go into hiding and senator Averil Power depart acrimoniously. The Fine Gael-Labour coalition sensed a second term was in the offing, but less than a year later all had changed, as it often does in politics. Labour lost 30 seats, Fine Gael almost as many, and Fianna Fáil doubled its number of Dáil deputies.
While the referendum demonstrated that a new Ireland is emerging before our eyes, the implications for the political system may not be as groundbreaking as some are expecting or hoping for.

IPL Plastics, formerly known as One51 and which is planning to float on the Toronto Stock Exchange, issued late on Friday an amended and restated preliminary prospectus.
The additional information disclosed by the company announced four new American-based directors as well as its results for the first quarter of this year.
David McAusland, a lawyer and corporate adviser, Sharon Pel, a former senior vice-president with TMX Group, Linda Kuga Pikulin, ex-president of PepsiCo Beverages Canada, and Mary Ritchie, chief executive of Richford Holdings, an accounting and investment advisory services firm based in Alberta, have all joined the board.
Rose Hynes, Hugh McCutcheon, Geoff Meagher and Alain Tremblay will all remain as non-executive directors of IPLP. On completion of its flotation, the company said McAusland would replace McCutcheon as chairman. Adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell by 16.8 per cent to CAN $6.8 million in the first quarter from $8.2 million for the same period a year earlier.
Revenue rose to CAN $148 million from $112.5 million for the same period. “The increase in revenue was in product areas with typically lower material margins, thereby increasing our relative cost of sales as a percentage of revenue,” the company said. Long-standing shareholders, which include Irish farmers and investors, will not be able to trade their stock for six months after the IPO.
The company said, however, it was offering to buy back as much as CAN $50 million worth of shares prior to then. Under the leadership of Alan Walsh, the company has sold off various investments and business interests in order to focus on its core rigid plastics business.

New Sugru owners will expand firm, founder says

Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh, the inventor of mouldable glue Sugru, says her company’s new owners will invest to expand the business after it was bought out by German adhesives giant Tesa for £7.6 million.
The deal left the company’s original investors nursing a roughly 90 per cent loss, but Ní Dhulchaointigh told The Sunday Business Post that http://businesspost.ie/418034, in order to help it expand into new markets.
“The priority for the next six months to a year is to get off to a great start with Tesa. We’re already working with them on expansion plans into Europe along with the advertising campaigns,” she said. “Focusing on those projects and the team, integrating them, is going to be the main focus for me for the next few months.
“The deal with Tesa is one that will help us develop a more successful retail model. As an independent company, the costs of driving awareness and demand have been more expensive than any of us imagined.”
The accounts for FormFormForm show that while sales grew over the last two years - from £3.5 million to £4.5 million between 2015 and 2016 – losses were rising just as fast. In the same year it had costs of £7.7 million, so that its loss for the year rose from £2.2 million to £3.3 million, and its accumulated losses were pushed to £8.7 million at the end of 2016.
Ní Dhulchaointigh insisted that despite these figures, she believed the product had growth potential.
“We know the demand for Sugru is global, we sell in 170 countries online, and it’s been a challenge to know how to expand in Europe with so many languages, so much complexity. Tesa isn’t well known in Britain and Ireland for historical reasons, but they are first or second in most European countries. The investment that they will be making is exactly what it needs.”
On Thursday, Ní Dhulchaointigh will attend the European Inventor of the Year awards in Paris - the first-ever Irish nominee - to be celebrated for her work on the product.

British retailer The Works is the latest tenant to join the line-up of occupants at Swords Central Shopping Centre in north Co Dublin.
The new unit extends to about 191 square metres with additional mezzanine storage and has been agreed at an annual rent of €115,000 per year.
Anna Kelly of JLL acted on behalf of the landlord, with Peter Love of Cushman & Wakefield acting for The Works. This deal is the latest of a number of new lettings expected to be announced in the coming weeks and will result in three of the four available units being leased to international occupiers. The Works is due to open its doors to the public next month.
Swords Central Shopping Centre connects to Penneys and Pavilions Shopping Centre and has one remaining unit available.
The prominent unit is at the main entrance to the centre and extends to almost 70 square metres. With a quoting rent of €60,000 per annum, it is expected to let quickly.
When the anticipated lettings are complete, the centre will be 99 per cent occupied.
In Dublin city centre, where JLL has been the sole letting and managing agent for Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre since it opened in 1988, the agent announced last week that gourmet Italian ice cream brand Amorino has just opened its first Irish store in the centre.
JLL has now been appointed by Amorino to acquire further locations in key Dublin sites.

Policing Authority slams ‘duplication’ of Garda oversight bodies

Highlight: The question of 'who guards the Gardaí' is being examined by the Commission on the Future of Policing, which is due to report to the government in September
Body


The Policing Authority has called for an end to “duplication” by the four bodies supervising the Gardaí.
The work of the country’s 13,000 gardaí is currently overseen by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc), the Garda Inspectorate, the Policing Authority and the policing division of the Department of Justice. Policing Authority chair Josephine Feehily said that there was not enough space for all of bodies involved.
“We are tripping over each other a bit. I actually feel sorry for the Gardaí running between the four of us. Our plea is for rationalisation,” she said.
The question of “who guards the Gardaí” is being examined by the Commission on the Future of Policing, which is due to report to the government in September. Gsoc is supposed to investigate Garda complaints, the Garda Inspectorate does research reports, and the Policing Authority holds Garda management to account at monthly meetings. The Department of Justice also has a policing division and a crime and security division. They deal with Garda pay and policy, as well as providing crime reports to Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan.
Feehily told the Oireachtas Justice Committee last week that the public were confused about which body to go to.
“We get letters addressed to them. We also have people thinking we are an appeal board for Gsoc because we’re there. We’re not,” she said.
The Policing Authority is supporting the private members bill being brought forward by Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan to give it additional powers.
The main one is a requirement for Garda management to notify it about any serious issues in the force, after it failed to do so in relation to the falsification of over 1.5 million breath tests.
However, the government is expected to block the bill on the grounds that it wants to wait for the Commission on Policing report.
Feehily also told the Justice Committee that there had been a “worryingly” high incidence of disciplinary outcomes being successfully challenged in the courts.
Earlier this month, three gardaí accused of serious disciplinary breaches arising from the handling of exhibits in a 2007 murder investigation won a legal action against the Garda Commissioner, stopping the substitution of a member on the disciplinary board of inquiry hearing their case.
Feehily called for a root-and-branch review of Garda disciplinary regulations for members accused of misconduct. She cited recommendations made by the Chair of the Disclosures Tribunal, Mr Justice Peter Charleton, in his first report last year.
Charleton concluded: “Gardaí accused of ill-discipline should be subject to correction by senior officers without the need to resort to the elaborate structures set up that constitute what is, in effect, a private trial using procedures akin to our criminal courts.”
A Garda spokesman said that the force was examining ‘options’ in relation to its disciplinary procedures, on foot of Mr Justice’s Charleton’s recommendations.

Pro14’s South African connection
Sunday Business Post
June 2, 2018

Length: 736 words
Byline: Barry J Whyte
Highlight: Irish provinces could soon be planning regular journeys to Johannesburg and beyond, if Pro14 chief executive Martin Anayi’s vision becomes a reality 
Body


Rugby’s Pro14 league will soon be a Pro16, according to chief executive Martin Anayi, but the ten-year plan is for two leagues with promotion and relegation.
It’s part of a major expansion plan that Anayi has been following since he was appointed in October 2015 – and the growth is reflected in the figures.
Last week it was announced that the company had doubled its revenue in the 2017/2018 season, and accounts show that Celtic Rugby, the company behind the Pro14, has seen revenue grow from £15.1 million in 2016 to £16.5 million in 2017 – and Anayi suggests that they could be closer to £25 million this year.
That’s in part down to revenue from sponsorship from major brands like Guinness and new broadcast deals with the likes of Eir Sport, while Anayi has also been growing the number of teams in the league.
He is coy about just where the two new teams will come from, but all signs point to South Africa, who he describes as “happy to have a foot in both” southern and northern hemisphere competitions.
“Are they looking to do more of that? I think yes is probably the answer to that. And are we willing to work with them to bring them in? Yes, otherwise we wouldn’t have put Jurie Roux and Rassie Erasmus on our board,” he said, referring to the chief executive of South Africa Rugby and the national team’s head coach, respectively.
Fans should not expect that an Australian or New Zealand team will follow the South African example, he warned.
“If you look at one of the rationales for why it works for South Africa, it’s actually time zones,” he said. “It’s an overnight flight, 12-hour direct into London, so I think it works from a TV perspective – a fan at home is tuning in to a game in the right time zone and you know that fits with their viewing habits.”
And the previously mooted suggestion of a North American franchise has also gone cool, he said, since World Rugby seems keen to let the game grow organically over there, rather than create a major franchise from scratch to compete against well-established teams in the Pro14.
All of which makes it far more likely that when the Pro14 turns to the Pro16 – which Anayi describes as “my ideal” – it will be made up of two more South African teams.
That does not mean, however, that the expansion will stop there, and Anayi is keen on the idea of a two-division competition with promotion and relegation.
He already believes that a real competitive edge has benefited the Italian teams – pointing out that the removal of the automatic spot for Italian teams in the Champions Cup has inspired Benetton Treviso to their best ever league performance, with 11 wins and narrowly missing out on qualification.
The same spirit of competition could help to inspire “teams in Germany, teams in Spain, teams in Georgia, in Romania, in Belgium, in Russia – all these teams need somewhere to go in their development,” he said.
The game is not without clouds on the horizon though, he said, most notably the dangerously inflating bubble of player wages at a number of clubs in France and England.
Anayi answered diplomatically, but clearly believes that the Pro14 and its clubs need to resist the runaway budgets of France and England.
“There is exponential growth in the player cost side that doesn’t really bear any resemblance to the commercial reality of whether that’s a club revenue structure or a tournament revenue structure,” he said. In short, a bubble.
“[Player costs are] going up every year, so you know there’s got to be a point where we say, ‘That’s actually what the cost structure should be for the game of professional rugby union in these markets – in European markets.’” In short, a burst.
Meanwhile, he’s happy with the Pro14’s growth under his stewardship. Two years ago, no Pro12 team (as it was then) made it out of the pool stages in the European Champions Cup. This year, Pro14 teams won the Champions Cup and the secondary Challenge Cup tournaments, while he also points to the fact that the Pro14 has seen six different winners in six season, that Ireland, Wales and Scotland were the top three teams in the Six Nations, and the fact that this year’s Lions tour had the biggest representation of Celtic teams ever.
“So I think overall, if you ask if our game is in good health, you’d say yes it is competitively, and yes it’s getting there commercially,” he said. “But you need to work doubly hard to make sure that’s the case in five years’ time.”

Profile of Murdoch MacLennan: The other Murdoch

Length: 1798 words
Byline: Colette Sexton
Highlight: MacLennan will need all of his expertise to deal with INM, whose registered shareholders include three of Ireland’s richest men – billionaires Denis O’Brien, Dermot Desmond and, as of last month, Larry Goodman
Body


Factfile
Name: Murdoch MacLennan
Age: 69
Appearance: softly-spoken, bespectacled, balding Scotsman
Newsworthiness: Independent News & Media’s new chairman has hit the headlines repeatedly in recent weeks
On May 16, Murdoch MacLennan greeted the heir to the British throne in his capacity as Press Association chairman. The Prince of Wales and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were at a reception at Tate Britain celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Press Association. Two days later, MacLennan was perched on his own throne, holding court among shareholders of Independent News & Media.
It was MacLennan’s first annual general meeting since he took up the position as chair of the newspaper group in March. It is safe to say the crowd was a little different to what he is used to. He fielded questions which covered, among other topics, a shareholder who claimed that while his letters to the editor of the Irish Independent were never published, the paper continuously printed missives from one contributor in Co Cork; and another who wanted an INM journalist to investigate the fact that he was a “multimillionaire” who owned a “beautiful” car but was not allowed to drive it because he had not passed the driving test and was not allowed to “pull strings”.
If the behaviour of these shareholders fazed MacLennan, his face did not betray it. As curious as INM agms often are, he is a seasoned executive with decades of experience heading corporate meetings.
MacLennan was chief executive of the Telegraph Media Group for 13 years until June 2017, and remains on the board of the company which publishes the Daily Telegraph. The media mogul was poached by the owners of the Telegraph Media Group, the Barclay brothers, from Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, where he was group managing director for a decade from 1994 to 2004. Before that, he was managing director of Scottish tabloid the Daily Record and its Sunday sister the Sunday Mail.
He will need all of his expertise to deal with INM, whose registered shareholders include three of Ireland’s richest men – billionaires Denis O’Brien, Dermot Desmond and, as of last month, Larry Goodman.
He is, as they say in the media industry, a real newspaper man - but depending on how you look at it, his time at the Daily Telegraph, often classed as Britain’s newspaper of record, was either a roaring success or a complete disaster.
During his period in charge, the company returned healthy financials, including a £48.3 million pre-tax profit in 2015. The company recorded a fall in pre-tax profits to £32.2 million in 2016. Two weeks before the 2016 figures were released publicly in June 2017, MacLennan was replaced as Telegraph Media Group chief executive by Nick Hugh.
In his 13-year term as Telegraph Media Group chief executive, the paper’s circulation halved from about 920,000 to 461,000, it went through six editors, and the number of journalists working for the company dropped from more than 500 to fewer than 380.
Within three weeks of MacLennan taking up his role as TMG chief executive in October 2004, the managing director, finance director, sports editor and entire board of directors of its sister magazine, the Spectator, had left. A similar exodus has occurred at INM, with two board directors, Terry Buckley (no relation to Leslie Buckley) and Paul Connolly, and editor-in-chief Stephen Rae leaving within 11 days of the first annual general meeting that he chaired last month.
Buckley’s departure had been flagged already, but Rae’s had not been. Many had expected that INM’s head of tabloids Des Gibson might replace him. However, the company opted to appoint Belfast Telegraph executive Richard McClean in a newly created role as managing director of publishing.
While still in situ at the Telegraph in May 2016, MacLennan talked of ‘employee-friendly’ flexible working practices one day and announced editorial redundancies the next, one of many rounds that the company endured during his time at the helm.
It was reported in the London Independent that when MacLennan was managing director of the Daily Record in the 1990s, a wall in his office displayed a cartoon of him in a toga with a crazed smile and holding a knife, with a trail of blood and bodies behind him - which is not a very reassuring thought for INM employees.
On the plus side, financially INM, despite a number of profit warnings, is still throwing off profits. It reported a profit before tax of €28.5 million for the 12 months to the end of December 2017, down from €41.8 million the previous year. It had a cash balance of €91.5 million at the end of 2017, up from €84.8 million in 2016.
MacLennan said he was “well aware of the challenges currently facing news and online publishers all over the world” when he was appointed INM chairman. That might be the case, but INM has its own very particular set of challenges. His appointment was supposed to herald a major change in its fortunes, but its ghosts continue to linger on.
Just a couple of weeks after MacLennan joined the board, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) notified the company that it would seek the appointment of High Court inspectors to investigate several corporate governance issues, including a data breach and protected disclosures made by INM’s former chief executive Robert Pitt. The media company opposed the application by the ODCE, arguing that it would be disproportionate, damaging and costly. However, on Friday, INM lost its High Court bid to stop the state’s corporate watchdog appointing inspectors to the company.
Since the ODCE bombshell, it has been one headline after another, between the aforementioned high-profile departures and the revelation last week that INM was suing its former chairman, Leslie Buckley. Moreover, MacLennan’s role in INM has raised questions about his chairmanship of the Scottish Professional Football League.
Dave King, the chairman of Rangers FC - once the biggest club in the country before going bust in 2012 - has called for an investigation into what he claims is a conflict of interest between MacLennan and Dermot Desmond, who, as well as being a shareholder in INM,also has a large stake in Rangers’ former rivals Celtic. This claim has since been rebuffed by the SPFL.
It was not the first time MacLennan has made the headlines. His April 2008 wedding to beauty journalist Elsa McAlonan was covered in the British press, with columns describing it as the media wedding of the year. A who’s who of the British political, corporate and media worlds attended the event in Glasgow. A jet was chartered from London to Scotland for the nuptials, and the guest list included then British prime minister Gordon Brown, Dow Jones chief executive Les Hinton, Associated Newspapers owner Jonathan Harmsworth (aka Lord Rothermere) and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre.
But MacLennan received far less flattering coverage in February 2015 when journalist Peter Oborne, the former chief political commentator of the Telegraph, claimed that the distinction between editorial and commercial at the newspaper had collapsed, and placed the blame squarely at MacLennan’s feet.
[caption id="attachment_417914" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Independent News & Media CEO Michael Doorly and Chairman Murdoch MacLennan at the company’s AGM in Dublin earlier this year Pic: RollingNews.ie[/caption]
In an article for Opendemocracy.net, Oborne said that he had researched the newspaper’s coverage of major advertisers, including HSBC Bank, Cunard and Tesco, and found it troubling. He said he wrote to MacLennan and Telegraph chairman, Aidan Barclay, setting out his concerns about the newspaper, and handing in his notice. He was then invited to meet MacLennan.
“He was civil, served me tea and asked me to take off my jacket. He said that I was a valued writer, and that he wanted me to stay,” Oborne wrote. “I expressed all of my concerns about the direction of the paper. I told him that I was not leaving to join another paper. I was resigning as a matter of conscience. Mr MacLennan agreed that advertising was allowed to affect editorial, but was unapologetic, saying that ‘it was not as bad as all that’ and adding that there was a long history of this sort of thing at the Telegraph.”
Oborne had agreed to leave the newspaper quietly, out of loyalty to his colleagues, but when the Telegraph had what he saw as minimal coverage of a fresh HSBC scandal compared to other newspapers, he said he felt he had a duty to make it public.
 
Tthe Daily Telegraph faced even more criticism after it published an anonymous front-page article on February 20, 2015 which claimed that two people who worked in News UK’s advertising department, which publishes the Times and the Sun, had taken their own lives while under pressure to meet commercial targets. The then editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, urged MacLennan on Twitter to remove the story from the internet: “Come on, Murdoch. If you guys can take down HSBC stories you can take down this, too.”
MacLennan has been a favoured whipping-boy of Britain’s satirical current affairs magazine Private Eye over the years. The magazine saddled him with the nickname Shifty McGifty, a play on the sobriquet Lord McGifty, which MacLennan earned due to his reputation for giving presents to acquaintances.
But will his presence be a gift to INM? His chairmanship is expected to usher in a new digital era at the newspaper group, which will include a paywall in some form or another. As reported by The Sunday Business Post last week, INM believes it could make up to €70 million from digital annually if it introduces a paywall and targets the Irish diaspora.
MacLennan oversaw the Daily Telegraph’s introduction of a limited paywall in November 2016 which makes premium articles available only to subscribers. It had just over four million daily users in 2017 traffic, which was down 5.99 per cent year-on-year. While this is a fraction of that of competitors including the Daily Mail and the Guardian, it must be borne in mind that both of those websites give their content away for free.
As Telegraph Group’s chief executive, MacLennan spoke at the 2005 centenary celebrations of the Newspaper Publishers Association, warning of the dangers of the “Jeremiahs [sic] of doom”.
He went on: “During the past 70 years, newspapers have survived despite the radio and television revolutions and the throttling grasp of the trade unions.
In 1963, Cecil King, chairman of the Mirror Group, predicted that by 1970 only two newspapers would remain in existence, the Times and the Daily Mirror. Today, newspapers are fatter, more diverse and more entertaining than at any time in the previous century.”
It is fortunate that MacLennan has a positive attitude to his task: he is going to need it.

Highlight: The Great Music in Irish Houses festival still retains the sort of ambition and determination that first fuelled its formation in 1970
Body


It may be within sight of its 50th anniversary, but the Great Music in Irish Houses festival still retains the sort of ambition and determination that first fuelled its formation in 1970.
This festival has always been a centrepiece of classical music activity, particularly chamber works, during the summer season, and the world-class status of its musicians and ensembles has never been in doubt. Every concert is a class act, but the festival has never been shy either at making hard decisions to keep in tune with the times.
Four years ago, it took the marketing decision to change the name of the festival from Music in Great Irish Houses to Great Music in Irish Houses: a sleight of words, perhaps, but a very effective means of expanding the choice of venues and musical possibilities.
So it comes as no surprise to see such alarming words like ‘electric’ and ‘eclectic’ and even the dreaded ‘rock’ word itself entering the festival programme for this coming season (June 12-17).
Still present is the traditional stellar line-up of architectural gems such as Rathfarnham Castle and Killruddery House, but also fascinating spaces of the modern kind like Airbnb International Hub (‘The Box on the Docks’) on Hanover Quay and the National Botanic Gardens, which has proved considerable pulling power since being introduced a few years back.
The poster boy of this year’s event is undoubtedly the award-winning young Scottish guitarist Sean Shibe. The 26-year-old, of Japanese and Scottish parentage, has caused something of a sensation across the water and was recently honoured by the Royal Philharmonic Society with its Young Artist award.
“Sean is definitely something out of the ordinary for the festival,” says artistic director Ciara Higgins, the vibrant force behind festival programming. “His SoftLOUD is a fantastic experience and won enormous critical acclaim at Edinburgh Festival last year. It takes place at Waterways Ireland [Dublin docklands office] and ranges from works by James MacMillan to Julia Wolfe and David Lang.
“But loyal friends need not be unduly alarmed. We also feature three world-class quartets: the Sacconi from Britain, and the Van Kuijk and Modigliani from France.
“Patrons should take note of the very opening piece of the festival, which will be performed by the Sacconi and sung by Irish tenor Robin Tritschler on June 12. This is the Irish premiere of the haunting in Damascus, a setting of verses by Syrian poet Ali Safar. It was described by Gramophone magazine as ‘a masterpiece which should leave the listener utterly exhausted’.”
Not exhausted enough, we hope, to miss out on other great works by Haydn and Shostakovich.
General manager Laurie Cearr said that, for 48 years, the festival had striven to stage world-class events in places of great historical interest. “We take pride in it being Ireland’s longest-running chamber music festival, and we aim to build on its reputation at home and abroad,” she said.

One of the most popular additions to the Great Music in Irish Houses event in recent years has been the hugely successful Dublin Musical Saunter, a mini-festival within the festival, which concludes the week-long event on Sunday, June 17, with recitals by exceptional soloists in three separate venues of outstanding architectural merit.
The French Embassy hosts dazzling clarinetist Carol McGonnell – recently lauded for a “stupendous” performance by the LA Times – with a concert of new music in the International Hub Offices of Airbnb (12pm).
Soprano Anna Devin joins impeccable piano accompanist Dearbhla Collins for musical settings of poetic works by Auden, Yeats, Joyce and Britten in Dublin Castle’s Chapel Royal, a stunning venue with history seeping out of every stone. (3pm)
Hugh Tinney, a former director of this festival, is saluted by the current office holders on his 60th birthday in a programme that includes Schubert, Beethoven and Chopin at the beautifully-restored Pillar Room in the Rotunda Hospital. (7pm)
Seven choirs from across the United States, comprising 130 choristers, will be performed in the hallowed halls of Dublin’s Christ Church Cathedral during the third Dublin Choral Festival on Saturday, June 16. The festival’s overall theme is Sounds of Spirituality, a concert for Bloomsday, which features contemporary works from both sides of the Atlantic.
The concert will include works from Michael McGlynn of Anúna, John Rutter and Dave Brubeck. Jazz icon Brubeck’s son Darius will make a special appearance to play two piano pieces written by his father, while a key highlight will be the performance of Love’s Old Sweet Song, a tune warbled by Molly Bloom in Joyce’s Ulysses.

Rajoy leaves Spain in a manageable mess

Highlight: Economic performance is good, the new socialist prime minister wants to hold on to Rajoy’s budget and the Catalan crisis is not boiling over 
Body


Say what you will about Mariano Rajoy, whose ability to govern Spain is over after seven tumultuous years as prime minister, but it’s in large part thanks to him that the country’s political crisis is not really a crisis for anyone but Spanish politicians, and in particular, not for the European Union.
Rajoy, who lost a vote of confidence, and his job, on Friday, has often been accused of unconstructive stubbornness and passivity in the face of challenges to the country, his party and himself personally. These formidable challenges have included the Catalan secession drive, which Rajoy pushed back without compromise (but also without lasting success), and the recent devastating judgments in a case that revealed a vast kickback scheme within his Partido Popular (People’s Party).
Rajoy tried to play down the corruption case even as Pedro Sánchez, leader of the Partido Socialista Obrero Español (Spanish Socialist Workers Party) rallied support in parliament for a no-confidence vote on Thursday. When the Basque nationalists, whose five votes gave Sánchez the slim majority he needed, declared their position, Rajoy wasn’t even in the room: he spent eight hours in a Madrid restaurant instead.
At first sight, he leaves behind a mess. The Catalans are as determined as ever to win independence, and the region has perhaps its most radical government ever. The traditional party system, in which the People’s Party has squared off against the Socialists for more than 30 years, is in tatters. Two young parties formed to challenge the corrupt political establishment – the centre-right Ciudadanos and left-wing Podemos – lead the nationwide polls. Sánchez will have trouble running the country as prime minister for long because his coalition with Podemos and small nationalist parties is patently only a temporary, anti-Rajoy one.
Oddly, however, none of this really matters regarding Spain’s ability to continue its recovery from the crisis that hit it hard at the beginning of the decade.
The Rajoy era ends with the country’s economy on track to grow 2.7 per cent this year, according to Bloomberg’s consensus forecast, after two years of more than 3 per cent growth. Unemployment is still at a dismal 17 per cent, but that compares favourably with the peak of more than 26 per cent in 2013. The fiscal deficit is at 2.5 per cent of economic output this year after peaking out at 10.5 per cent in 2012.
As head of a weak minority government, Rajoy managed to negotiate a budget that Sánchez wants to keep.
Politically, too, there isn’t much to worry about. The Catalan crisis may be a constant nuisance, but real secession is not on the cards while half of Catalonia’s population doesn’t want it and the separatists are determined to avoid violence. As for the two-party system’s collapse, Rajoy has effectively served as a midwife for a new responsible and skilful political elite without the corrupt baggage the Socialists, to a large extent, share with the People’s Party.
The rise of Ciudadanos and Podemos in the midst of the crisis (the former became a national force in 2013, the latter was founded in 2014) once promised traumatic shifts like the one under way in Italy today.
The two parties came out of what political scientist Aristide Zolberg would have termed a “moment of madness”, a political moment when “all is possible”.
Podemos came from a culture of uncompromising anti-capitalist protest, with an economic programme that originally included a universal basic income without any concern for its costs and a “citizens’ audit” of Spain’s national debt leading potentially to default. As the party matured, however, these demands were dropped and its programme, still determinedly leftist, is already compatible with the mainstream. As for Ciudadanos, despite its leaders’ insistence that it’s neither left nor right, it’s a perfectly mainstream political force whose centre-right instincts have drawn voters away from the People’s Party more than from the Socialists.
While Rajoy sat at the top of the old crumbling hierarchy, a new political elite coalesced around sane, workable ideas. It wants change, renewal, a cleaner government, perhaps a more generous social policy, but even those parts of it that wanted to blow things up are no longer eager to do it. Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias recently bought a €600,000 house with a swimming pool, which triggered a confidence vote in his party which he survived.
Both young parties are potentially ready to take part in coalitions. In a series of inconclusive elections held in the Rajoy era and the political manoeuvring that followed them, they acquired the experience of national-level negotiations and a sense of how the country is governed. No matter what political combinations emerge from an early election, if that’s what now happens, there is little danger that Spain will adopt any disastrous economic policies. Unlike elsewhere in Europe, xenophobic forces have gained no traction, and the various competing nationalisms in Spain are internally focused. Spexit isn’t really a word.
Spain’s crises look, feel and are manageable. No one will thank Rajoy for that, and his motivations throughout his time in government may have been as selfish as they were patriotic.

Ready for their close-up: Meet the Insta-grans

Highlight: The biggest growth group on Instagram are the over-65s, who are flocking to the platform for one unifying reason: ‘to repudiate invisibility’ 
Body


Few Instagram bios can truthfully state “stealing yo’ man since 1928”, but that’s just what the Baddie Winkle’s (@baddiewinkle) tagline espouses. And with a glance, you can well believe the claim. The blogger and Instagram sensation, whose real name is Helen Ruth Elam Van Winkle, was indeed in born in 1928 (July 18, in Hazard, Kentucky to be exact) and is part of the growing mix of mature women who have embraced Instagram as a platform for self expression.
In fact, despite a widespread perception of the picture-sharing platform being governed by Kardashians and a Kardashian-esque youth league, the over-65s are now driving growth in social media. Pew Research Centre has been charting a steep increase in plus-65 users since 2014, and while other age groups have been plateauing, Instagram has become a favourite among a more mature audience.
Facebook has had a desperate few months, and is showing signs of slowing growth, clocking in at 527 million users by the end of last year. Instagram, however, is growing rapidly from a recent 400 million user count. And while Facebook remains the dominant force when it comes to engagement, with three quarters of its users engaging daily, Instagram is not far behind, with 50 per cent now actively engaging each day. Yes, the percentage of over-65 users remains small (just over 2.2 per cent of the community, as of April of this year), but is soon to change.
[caption id="attachment_417740" align="alignleft" width="624"] Baddie Winkle: ‘stealing yo’ man since 1928’[/caption]
Mature early adopters of the medium are already becoming major brands. Sixty-nine-year-old Linda Rodin (@lindaandwinks) is one of the earliest and biggest breakout stars of Instagram. A model in the 1960s, then a stylist for the likes of Harper’s Bazaar and Madonna, the US native started her own beauty line in 2008, embraced Instagram in 2013, and now has 226,000 followers.
Her feed is a mix of her own unique style – signature sunglasses and killer clothes captured in selfies around New York – as well as the interesting visuals she comes across, mixed with flashback images of her past. “It’s a visual encyclopedia for me,” she says. “I find incredible images and I print them out and keep them.”
Interestingly, she doesn’t reciprocate her followers’ affection, following precisely nobody on the platform. “I don’t want to wake up to all of those images,” she says. “I’d rather discover artists or islands that I never even knew existed myself – and I don’t want to see anyone’s dinner.”
Possibly the biggest sensation, in terms of mature Irish instagram stars, is Eileen ‘Style Queen’ Smith (@eileenstylequeen), who at 79 has clocked up an impressive 21,000 followers. With her regular posts in impeccable outfits, from faux fur lined coats mixed with pure wool two pieces punctuated with perhaps a leather studded handbag, she’s giving millennials a run for their money.
One aesthete who has also found a creative outlet on the photo-sharing app is Irish fashion designer Peter O’Brien (@peterobriendesign), whose Instagram bio probably best describes him: “Irish Costume/Fashion designer: Curmudgeon: Sondhead: Lover of old jewels I cannot afford so I buy too many books instead.” First joining Instagram to engage with his design students, he has remained active ever since. “I was curious,” he tells me. “I had a look and got hooked. I love using it, as I think it can be what you want it to be.”
O’Brien uses Instagram as a visual sourcebook, rather than a self-promotion tool. “My Instagram is a 99.99 per cent selfie-free zone,” he says. “I follow costume and theatre designers, illustrators, some fashion folk and anything to do with design, architecture, interiors and most especially antique jewellery dealers. I really like getting to see other people’s work and enjoy chatting to other illustrators and designers whom, in normal circumstances, I would never get to meet.”
Though Instagram can prove a useful platform for publicising his latest clothing collection, O’Brien says he’s not terribly good at using it as a marketing tool. “I prefer it to Facebook as it’s essentially visual . . . and it’s generally kinder than Twitter, which I now tend to avoid.
“One can also remain pretty anonymous and private. This appeals to me hugely as we live in an age of oversharing: the emotional exhibitionism that seems to be quite common on Facebook does not appeal to me at all. I’m not keen on the pouty, narcissistic, selfie aspect but, if I’m honest, I suppose my posting a drawing is just as vain as my posting my contoured cheekbones . . . were I to have them.”
For other mature adopters, the safe space of Instagram is a boon, and affords them an outlet they feel is lacking in mainstream media. Fifty-nine-year-old Dubliner Susan Jackson, whose Eternal Style feed (@eternalstyle_ie) has almost 10,000 followers, says this was a big motivator when embracing Instagram.
Jackson, the mother of the phenomenally successful blogger and Instagrammer Suzanne Jackson (234,000 followers), identified a need for more mature women talking about style. “I’d attend an event with my daughter and there would be other mothers there with their daughters too, and yet no one was really talking properly to them,” she says. “People my age are kind of forgotten about. There is certainly a gap in the market for the older woman.”
[caption id="attachment_417741" align="alignright" width="469"] Hilda Smith: ‘I turn down a huge amount of stuff that comes in. I am choosy’ Pic: Fergal Phillips[/caption]
Having retired from her financial services job five years ago, the chance to enjoy her new-found fashion freedom prompted Jackson to start posting on Instagram. “I share pictures of simple, everyday style for women my age,” she says. She has, to date, shied away from commercial collaborations, preferring to share her clothing choices with positive messaging about mature style. There are plans afoot, however, for a website later in the summer. “The community of women of my age are really looking to see other women out there,” she says. “I just love receiving their lovely comments; it’s all about positivity for me.”
Hilda Smith of the wonderfully titled Over The Hilda blog and Instagram account @overthehilda, agrees. The retired schoolteacher started blogging two and half years ago “as a bit of a joke”, and progressed to Instagram a year later (inspired also by her daughter, Dublin stylist Courtney Smith, who has a following of 50,400). The 61-year-old admits it took time to overcome her technology phobias. “I had no technical expertise,” she says, “making it a major learning curve for me.”
Once Smith was up and running online, she reached out to bloggers in the US and Britain, many of whom are involved in the Fierce 50 Revolution, a online movement that began last year to champion mid-life women. This connected her with a network of mature bloggers who derive profits from social media activity. This business model is less common in Ireland, says Smith, although brands have begun to approach her for collaborations and commercial work.
One of those brands is the family-run department store Shaws. Managing director Jonathan Shaw says it is a natural move for retailers such as theirs. “Instagram is a wonderfully inspirational social media platform and that’s why we have made it the focus of our new social media campaigns,” he tells me. “To make our brand more relatable we searched for inspirational Irish women across generations who can showcase our offering, and who share our values.”
Shaw believes that the the mature Insta-influencer is a force to be reckoned with. “When we use a mature Instagrammer the influence extends beyond their peers,” he says. “These are women who everyone in the family looks up to. Their vibrant attitude makes them role models, and people we could all learn a little from.”
Smith is happy to partner with the department store, she says, as she remembers spending her first pocket money there. Local shops in her native Malahide have been supportive too, happy to lend her pieces to road test online. That said, she is cautious about courting brands.
“I turn down a huge amount of stuff that comes in,” she says. “I am choosy. I am not going to go out there and endorse something I don’t like. I think my followers would know if I was not being genuine.”
Smith’s posts go beyond the superficial, though, digging deeper into health issues, the menopause, ageing, and the challenges and joys of a second marriage. She believes this creates resonance and adds substance to her social media output. “I want it to be honest,” she says. “I don’t shy away from difficult subjects.”
Indeed, it’s the overriding positivity of Instagram that seems to be winning mature users over, including my aunt, Gerry Sweetman, who lives in Chicago. At 71, she has embraced the platform with the enthusiasm of a 21-year-old, and, having left Ireland more than 40 years ago, uses the platform to connect with a wider community.
“Initially I joined Instagram because I loved seeing people’s photos, images of their lives, children, dogs, gardens, outfits, all of their creations,” she says. Her feed (@gerry_sweetman) is a mix of her style, objects she loves and throwbacks to images of her past. “I love that it feels more personal,” she says, “more selective than Facebook, but also lighter, brighter, and more playful for creative types.”
It all comes back to connection. “I do notice who has commented or liked my postings, and that’s always fun. I also love Instagram as it can introduce me to a writer or photographer I didn’t know before.” Not your typical granny, Gerry’s style is exemplary; her catalogue of ‘looks through the ages’ could happily live in a Taschen tome of its own. Her radar too, is eclectic, nuanced, and often outré (her current instagram crush is @queerappalachia, “A Celebration of Queer Voices and Identities from Appalachia and the South”).
Always hugely talented with fabric and design, Sweetman has more recently begun to showcase her output on Instagram, including a small collection of kaftans. “I know people sell over Instagram, but I haven’t got round to it yet.” she says. “For now, it’s just for fun.”
It’s that sense of fun that underpins the mature Instagrammer mindset. That, and a desire to present something traditional media has long overlooked. “The great thing about the older influencer community,” says Hilda Smith, “is that we are very supportive of each other. It’s not about competition. It’s about celebrating who we are, at 50, 60, 70 . . . and beyond.”

Report calls for more equitable division of funding for drugs task forces in Dublin

Highlight: The conclusions are contained in a new report aimed at finding the best way to fund the country’s 14 local drug task forces for areas with high concentration of drugs, as well as ten regional drug task forces
Body


Drug taskforce funding should be shifted from the southside to the northside in the capital city to meet the needs there, according to a new report.
And the money allocated to regional drug task forces also needs to be increased because they are getting a smaller share of funding than urban drug task forces.
The conclusions are contained in a new report aimed at finding the best way to fund the country’s 14 local drug task forces for areas with high concentration of drugs, as well as ten regional drug task forces for the rest of the country.
Consultant Trutz Haase and his co-author Jonathan Pratschke found that drugs task forces on the southside of Dublin were getting 41 per cent of the available funding, even though an analysis suggested their share should be around 27 per cent.
“Unless a much stronger justification is advanced for the systematic over-funding of local area drugs task forces in southside Dublin, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that a redistribution of resources is required,” the report said.
The report was one of the final pieces of work carried out by Haase, an experienced social and economic consultant who died last April after a battle with cancer.
It comes at a time when the government is currently carrying out a public consultation about scrapping criminal convictions for people caught with drugs for their own personal use.

Retail Ireland hopes to boost sector as employment option

Highlight: While the retail sector has undergone incredible transformation in recent decades it is still one heavily dependent on human skills and abilities for interaction
Body


As an employer of more than 280,000 people, the Irish retail sector offers a diverse range of career opportunities and roles.
And Retail Ireland is working to further boost its attractiveness as Thomas Burke, Director of Retail Ireland, told The Sunday Business Post.
“The face of retail is so vital. When a customer walks into a store, the first person they meet is the shop assistant, so it’s so important the right people are in the right jobs. And that goes for back office workers too. So here at Retail Ireland we’re working on initiatives to show people that retail is a wonderful sector in which to work, to develop and to find a pathway for career progression,” he said.
While the retail sector has undergone incredible transformation in recent decades it is still one heavily dependent on human skills and abilities for interaction. Technology can assist in the day-to-day, but people are still at the sector’s heart.
Though less labour-intensive than in generations past, the sector provides more highly-skilled roles with improved renumeration and conditions. Indeed, average pay rates in the Irish retail sector are in the top five in the European Union, and retail is Ireland’s largest private sector employer.
And so, over the last 18 years the Retail Ireland Skillnet programme has worked with those in the retail industry in the areas of education, training and skills development.
“In that time, we’ve had over 20,000 people take courses on the programme," says Burke. “We offer work-based education and training for the retail sector. The courses range from QQI accredited level 5 modules in the likes of warehousing, safety and health at work and retail selling and customer service, all the way to a Bachelor of Business (honours degree) in retail management practice and an MA in innovation and leadership.
“Furthermore, we are currently rolling out a range of specialist programmes in retail digital marketing and ecommerce, to equip the people in our industry with the range of skills required to meet the emerging challenges of modern retailing. The great thing about retail is that there is a role for everybody and we want to keep working to provide those pathways into the sector for people and then show them how they can progress and develop their careers from within.”
The reality is that modern retail requires so much more than just front-of-shop personnel, though their importance to a successful business can never be underestimated, but also the sector requires the likes of data analysists, eCommerce specialists, digital marketers, loss preventers, app developers, photographers, customer service experts, supply chain managers, accountants, legal professionals and more.
And here in Ireland the quality of the sector’s professionals acts as a huge selling point for retailers across the board.
“The quality of the Irish retail sector’s offering is second to none. Its something we do extremely well. It’s authentic and customers respect that. We’ve a great ability when it comes to putting the customer first and providing a strong and welcoming customer experience. And when that’s also backed up with the highest standards of professional services behind the scenes its an unstoppable combination,” said Burke.
There are also plans to develop an apprenticeship scheme – unique to the retail sector. The programme will be up and running in 2019. Funding for the scheme has been secured and Retail Ireland is currently developing modules which will enable apprentices to see many different aspects of the retail experience.
“You know, at the highest levels of retail in Ireland today are those who’ve worked their way up from the shop floor. Retail is a sector where upward mobility can be achieved relatively speedily, and the key is providing the entry route and the pathway for those interested in progressing within the sector,” says Burke.
“The perception of what it means to work in retail is changing. It’s an exciting and ever-changing sector and we hope more people will consider a career in this dynamic segment of Irish business.”

Return of intelligence

Highlight: As the road to digital transformation stretches out, the field of AI is gaining a second wind in many different ways, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body


Trends tend to come in peaks and troughs. When something new emerges, it’s rare that it goes from nothing to standard in one go.
Smartphones were around long before the iPhone made them mainstream, video games suffered a major crash in the 1980s before a revival that turned them into a multibillion euro industry, and developments in computing means actions are processed faster than ever.
The same can be said of some technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), which is experiencing a second wind. The term has been around for a while, but it’s only in recent years that we have the technology to start looking at it in a serious capacity.
It’s still in its early days, but for Jeff McCann, the IoT and OEM director at Dell EMC customer solution centre, the sheer amount of data available makes it a feasible option.
“AI has been around for quite a long time, and a lot of the techniques and technologies have been around for a long time, but the main reason things have changed is around the availability of data being produced,” he said. “One of the challenges at this stage is gathering all of that data together and being able to process it in a meaningful and timely manner.
“There are lots of tools out there, which tools do you use and also how to manage them, support them and gain insights out of them, so you get things back.”
Something that McCann mentions is how broad a term AI is. The purpose is to help computers act more intelligently and can cover areas like robotics, language processing and machine learning to name a few.
In short, it’s something that’s becoming more relevant with each passing day as it’s implemented into regular products like our email accounts or recommendation services. It’s only recently that we’ve started seeing more obvious examples like Amazon Alexa popping up.
“We look at AI as being new, but there are lots of examples of offerings out there that are using what we look upon as AI solutions,” said McCann. “Information has been taken and built into an algorithm for machines to use, but even ten or five years ago, you [couldn’t] imagine that chatbots could be utilised so effectively to provide around 90 per cent of customer enquiries.
“Simple enquiries that allow for the fast answering of a phone system or when customers are phoning in through telephone lines and enabling the staff within the call centres to undertake the more complex enquiries that customers would have.
“Again, it’s down to improving customer experience coming into the centres and stuff like that.”
Part of the reason why AI sees this resurgence is the current environment allows for a number of breakthroughs. Such developments rarely rely on one element but numerous different factors to ensure.
“There’s a lot of breakthroughs around AI, especially how we train machines and how we use the data to learn and make sense of the physical surrounding in a digital way,” he said.
“Another area then is around computing power, the processing power that we have today is just mind-blowing compared to where we were a few years ago. [With] the amount of data we have available, it doesn’t matter which magazine or article you look at, there will be sensors that are going to be creating data and providing information on the physical world back to the computing abilities of the future.”
To understand where AI is at, you have to look at the wider picture. Much of what’s driving this is how much of the world is being digitalised; businesses are now having to rely on technologies taken for granted a few years ago to keep up.
For Gary O’Callaghan, chief executive of Siemens Ltd, Dublin, this is all part of a major change in the world called the fourth industrial revolution.
“It’s the largest transformation in the history of industry, and its power and speed will eclipse all that has gone before,” he said. “It’s changing the way we manufacture, communicate, learn, work and do business.
“[It] presents a window of opportunity for boosting competitiveness by increasing productivity and enabling Irish companies to achieve greater integration into the global value chain. To enable that growth, increasing the efficient use of resources, skills and expertise should be the primary aim of all stakeholders in the economy.”
[caption id="attachment_417570" align="alignleft" width="721"] Niall Campion, managing director, VRAI[/caption]
It ties in with a report Siemens released back in December 2017 where it found that digitalisation was seen by Irish business leaders as a way to help improve processes and efficiencies.
While much of the work has been moving from traditional methods to digital methods, this stage is about taking those processes and refining them further.
Ireland has a long way to go before it adapts to the new changes, but it represents an opportunity.
“Anticipating the threat of disruptive new business models, there is a clear imperative in leading Irish companies to engage with organisations seeking pilot projects, data expertise and good data sources while also looking to build a digital reputation,” said O’Callaghan. “In some industries, where there are very high numbers of homogeneous customers, robotic process automation is seen as a driver of operational efficiency.
“In general, many companies in Ireland still have room to grow when it comes to implementing a holistic digitalisation strategy. Therefore they should seize this potential to help improve their internal processes, productivity and cooperation with suppliers and customers.”
One significant element that will help this industrial revolution is education. There are some practical elements to it like promoting digital skills in schools and universities while businesses support their employees by providing training for digital skills.
O’Callaghan argues that if the workforce doesn’t keep up to speed with developments like AI, filling the next wave of jobs will be difficult.
“At the heart of the fourth industrial revolution and thereby digital transformation is organisational culture,” he said. “Irish businesses must look at their hierarchies, decision processes, risk appetite and their speed and agility in decision-making. They must also encourage innovation and adaptability.
“Digitalisation has already demonstrated its disruptive power. It has turned entire industries upside down. You know the saying: ‘The internet cuts out the middleman.” Indeed, the digital age does not tolerate mediocrity. It’s binary. One or zero. On or off. It’s that simple — and yet extremely difficult to accept.”
O’Callaghan urges companies to listen and understand their customers and use that information to help shape their business. It should be used to help develop its value chains, business models and determine the type of technologies that they should invest in.
This ties in with Siemens’ intent to invest €5.6 billion in research and development in the 2018 fiscal year which will go into future technologies like blockchain technology, autonomous machines, and distributed energy systems, all of which O’Callaghan says are “crucial for ensuring the viability of our company in the digital future”.
“The fourth industrial revolution poses great risks for those who stand on the sidelines, who rather wait and see, and who gets stuck in endless discussions, yet it offers great opportunities for those who actively shape it,” he said. “We should seize these opportunities.”
While that industrial revolution starts to gain momentum, key elements like AI are beginning to help influence certain industries.
Sales and marketing are the obvious ones and for one of the newer industries, the Internet of Things (IoT) company Hive. What started off as a smart thermostat company has slowly expanded its services to include sensors, smart cameras and other devices to improve the home.
Key to that is a strong customer support service and for Neil Proctor, global head of customer systems for Centrica — the makers of Hive — an important part of that is to keep on top of all mentions and interactions.
“We use something called Salesforce Service Cloud which is a relative out-of-the-box way in dealing with customer interactions regardless of what the channel is,” he said. “Whether it’s Twitter, email or a phone call, it helps us keep all of those customer interactions in one place and get insights on them.
“We can see what customers are talking to us about, problems with the product and then we can use that insight to improve the product.”

As part of its partnership with Salesforce, it plans to upgrade its service by using its updated AI service Einstein, a service that takes datasets and analyses it to bring predictions and recommendations for your business.
The goal is to let it assist those working within its customer support service so it can help solve regular problems as well as knowing who to route a query to if it can’t be solved. It’s a lofty goal, but there are challenges to overcome first before it becomes a reality.
“What we’re trying to do with Einstein is train it with historic email interactions,” he said. “Email is difficult to interpret via computer as when you get one, it’s very hard to route it to the right agent. You don’t know if it’s a tech query or account query unless someone manually reads it.
“We’re trying to leverage Einstein to read what’s coming in, interpret whether it’s a tech query or a query about a certain product and then automatically respond to the customer with some help and/or route that query to the correct agent. There’s a massive efficiency to be gained by this.”
That efficiency is part of the reason why call centres and similar entities are adopting the likes of chatbots and other methods. No matter what business you work in, there will always be problems or queries that crop up again and again.
The use of AI isn’t to replace a human but to complement the work they’re already doing. If it’s a case that an AI can answer a query that comes up regularly and allows a human worker to focus on more important things, that’s a win.
As mentioned before, the technology still has significant challenges to overcome like recognising sentiment, whether a customer is happy or sad, what they’re looking for and how useful the information is, but Proctor says that it’s creating data sets to help interpret emails in an intelligent manner.
Not only does it put the customer first, but those working in customer service will be happier as they’re dealing with more complex and challenging problems.
“You need to use that one-to-one human element where it adds value,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily add value to a structured conversation like booking an engineer, for example, as it’s quite a standard action.
“They should be empowered to make choices about what they think is appropriate for machine learning and AI. If you have a call centre with 40 people and you get together and say we’re dealing with this same issue day after day and giving the same answer, then they should be empowered to then push that over to AI. It really should be in their gear for where they think it adds value and not where it doesn’t.
“As they talk to customers every day, they have the best judgment. They mightn’t have the best technical experience to deliver the AI, but they should be a heavy influence on how it’s useful.
“You end up with happier workers because they’re working on things that have a degree of challenge.”
Alongside the different areas that are being affected is one that you might not have considered previously: virtual reality (VR).
The medium, which was backed by Facebook through its acquisition of Oculus back in 2014, has seen the hype around it die down, but it’s very much front and centre for many industries.
One of which is VRAI, a Dublin-based company that offers VR and mixed-media content for organisations like the UN and the Defence Forces. One of its most recent projects was with the UN in Somalia where it designed an experience around counter IED bombs (improvised explosive device) training for soldiers.
“It’s quite difficult to spot on the road, so the problem they were having in Somalia was that the UN staff who were civilian mostly couldn’t understand why the military side of the UN weren’t able to clear the road of IEDs,” said Niall Campion, managing director of VRAI.
“What we did was made an experience to show how to spot IEDs on the road as in reality, it’s incredibly difficult to spot them. [While] we were selling it as a trainer for soldiers to show how to do it better, it became an experience to show the civilian staff of the UN how difficult it is to spot them.
“It’s an empathy-building piece and in the broader context of VR, it’s quite a good tool in doing that by putting yourself in someone else’s shoes.”
[caption id="attachment_417572" align="alignleft" width="615"] Neil Procter Global head of customer services, Centrica[/caption]
The way it plans to use AI to help its experience is by adding virtual characters to its experiences. Through language and voice recognition, they will be able to respond to what you say depending on the context of the experience they’re in.
“These [experiences] are all first-person experiences, they’re single-user experience at the moment so to go back to human emotion, we’re a social species so where we see AI being used in collaboration with VR is conversations with virtual characters and get realistic responses to them,” said Campion.
“All the headsets will have a microphone built into them so that you can put a virtual avatar in and then have realistic conversations with them.
“There’s an interesting case study where Audi has a training experience for shop staff. They built virtual customers so before you go into a shop to sell an Audi, you go into an experience where you have virtual customers taking to you and their AI who are giving parameters of answers they’re allowed to give back.”
The result is that from your responses in the experience, you and your team can then review your performance and see what areas you can improve in. In a way, VR suits this as it focuses more toward empathy, yet it highlights the role and purpose of AI and similar technologies: to complement and help existing roles and processes.
“With AI stuff, in some ways it’s sci-fi, but in other ways, it’s quite achievable,” said Campion. “And Amazon Lex, it’s the Alexa backend which you can access as a customer, so it’s off-the-shelf AI language recognition and that’s something that is built in reasonably easy, it’s just a case of finding the right project to build it into and that’s always what we’re looking for.”
A term that has been recently popping up in talk of new technologies (and in this piece) is the fourth industrial revolution, a term that originated from the World Economic Forum back in 2016.
The idea is that innovations like AI, Internet of Things and autonomous cars are the technologies that will drive this forward.
If you’re wondering how it was decided this would be the fourth and what came before it, it’s broken up into the following:
The first industrial revolution concerns those technologies that used water and steam power to help mechanise production.
The second industrial revolution moved on to electrical power to help develop mass production methods.
The third industrial revolution uses electronics and computing technology to help automate production. This is where technologies like the internet, processing power, computing and availability of devices like smartphones and PCs fit in.
The fourth industrial revolution builds on the work from the third by a fusion of technologies like AI, robotics, IoT, automation, self-driving cars, 3d printing and other new technologies. While the methods are different, the purpose of these technologies is the same: to help improve the efficiency and productivity of production while lowering the cost of doing so.
Among all of the talk around AI and other emerging technologies is the sheer amount of data that’s required for them to work.
With GDPR passed, it’s going to be more difficult for these companies to collect and test this data as individuals may be reluctant to share said data.
Neil Proctor, Centrica/Hive’s global head of customer systems, says this is a good thing overall as it will mean companies will start using data more responsibly, especially considering the industry it’s in.
“[GDPR is] a really good thing because the people who are abusing data or obtaining it illegally, they get punished as they should do,” he said.
“The people using the data in the right way with consent to improve the customer experience, they really shouldn’t have much to worry about.”
While GDPR does give data regulators some more bite when implementing new laws, the reality is that companies will need to do more. Following the letter of the law will only get you so far and further down the line, the focus will be on embodying the spirit of GDPR which is putting the user privacy and wishes front and centre.
“It’s top priority for Hive to make sure that happens, when you’ve got a company that is very data-driven like us,” said Proctor.
“Hive is part of a trend that will be coming across many different industries, products being connected is a trend that’s not going to stop so if you want to be a data-driven company, then you have to make sure you’re doing it responsibly and in the interest of customers.
“At Hive we’ve got lots of data, and there are things we could do potentially, but working out what is a beneficial use case for the customer, that’s quite a hard problem to solve.
“Once companies get over the technical hurdle, the next step is really working out what those differentiator use cases are, because I’m sure if you get it wrong, you’re not using the data in a way it’s intended or engaging the customer more, you’re just going to fail regardless of whether you can use data.”

Roscommon firm to launch toy farm fields in US

Cries of “It’s my field” are expected from children across the United States come September. The Field, a Roscommon-based toy company, is launching into the US market this autumn after gaining traction in Ireland and Britain over the past three years.
Set up by Padraic Cuddy, the company sells model toy fields on which children graze their toy farm animals and play with toy tractors.
Cuddy was a civil engineering contractor for 20 years, but launched artificial grass company Class Grass in 2010. Four years later, his wife Anita suggested that he make a field for their three-year-old son Tommy from the artificial grass.
“His buddies were coming into the house, and next thing there was a request for one from Santa Claus,” Cuddy said.
He spent nine months designing the packaging and the field, down to the gate.
“There were big rows over the gate opening in and opening out. Great fun, but a testing time,” he said.
Cuddy launched The Field at the Ploughing Championship in 2015, and it has appeared on The Late Late Toy Show every year since.
The products are now available in over 100 stores on the island of Ireland and now it is looking to the US market - but not in-store.
“We are not going into shops in the US. We had targeted those markets, but we realised that retail is heading into trouble. We are going directly into an Amazon fulfilment centre in Texas.
“We are going to run all our promotions on Amazon and on Facebook business. All traffic will be driven directly to mobile phones, because that is the way shopping is going.”
The Field, which has six products now, is already proving popular among the Irish diaspora.
“I remember a lady from Kerry ringing me saying her granddaughter was home for Christmas. She got The Field and she was gone back to Ethiopia with it,” he said.
Originally, the fields were made in Ireland and the packaging was imported from China. To facilitate the company’s expansion, it will increase production in China.
“China is going to get more and more production, and Ireland is going to get less because of the cost implications. We couldn’t compete worldwide if we were just making it in Castlecoote in Roscommon,” said Cuddy.

Body


RSM Ireland is a top ten accounting and business advisory firm specialising in providing advice to mid-market business leaders, both domestic and international. It offers four core services – Audit, Tax, Transaction Advisory Services and Management Consulting while also working for Not for Profit (NFP) companies across all these service lines.
Together with a 50-strong team, Catherine Corcoran, who is head of management consulting, works closely with NFPs in delivering these services - so has come across a lot of issues such as commerciality, which is necessary to deliver the ‘reason for being’, is viewed by the sector as an unpleasant distraction from the essence of what they do.
“It’s a mistake to view the work of our NFP clients with a one dimensional ‘financial’ lens,” said Corcoran. “We really need to bring with us a lens which understands that ‘mission’ is everything – and that finances, people and operations together with sales and marketing are functions which must work cohesively and collaboratively to deliver the essential outcome – ‘mission and purpose’ because their people unite around a ‘purpose’ that isn’t profit.
“At the root of all of this is a requirement to truly agree and understand what the entity’s mission is and the most effective strategy by which to deliver it – we do a lot of work with NFPs in arriving at this commonly agreed purpose and the value system that is required to deliver it. Execution and the arrival of action plans which deliver the strategy is a key challenge – and this type of work informs much of what we do – organising strategy into a cohesive set of action plans that deliver it with accountability and transparency around who does what. Value for money is key – and key to value is to spend your money on the right things.”
Corcoran said that ‘red zone’ crisis matters arise because strategy and action plans aren’t formulated properly and people aren’t organised in the correct way around their common purpose.
“We are there to support clients when these issues arise and to help set things up to prevent a similar crisis happening again,” she said. “And we much prefer to work with our NFPs on ‘green zone’ matters - which are preventative measures to ensure ‘red zone’ issues don’t happen. Examples of ‘red zone’ matters are fraud, serious workplace complaints, board implosion and adverse reputational events – all of which can be avoidable if more work was done in the ‘green zone’ to prevent them.”
According to Corcoran, a few key areas for NFPs to focus on in order to prevent ‘red zone’ crises while at the same time delivering on your mission are the following:
1. Live by your governance code – be practical in how you live it. It’s been carefully written to help you avoid the pitfalls.
2. Agree your overall mission and purpose – engage with stakeholders and gain cohesive buy-in to what to what you are there to achieve – it’s surprising how often this isn’t that clear.
3. Manage your money strategically and really align it to your mission.
4. Don’t think in silos – think across finance, HR, operations and marketing. It is the sum of these that will deliver your mission
5. Agree an action plan by which you will deliver your strategy, your mission and your values.
6. Value your ‘internal audit’ – it’s not there as an inconvenience, it’s there to help boards know what they should about the risks in the organisation.
7. Deliver accountability through your strategic action plans.
8. The command and control autocratic-style management is yesterday’s modus operandi. Today’s requirement is for authentic leadership which is rooted in allowing your people control over what they do – giving them the freedom to operate, the freedom to think and the freedom to speak, which is very motivational. You can achieve this by a system of controlled autonomy rooted in action plans.
9. Don’t let the heightened compliance environment get you down. Go with it and take proactive control over it – it's there for good reasons.
10. Finally, never forget your mission. It’ll keep you going on both the down days and the up days.

Highlight: In Miami’s property scene, former F1 star Eddie Irvine is flying off the grid 
Body


In the years after he retired from Formula One, Eddie Irvine invested in two Dublin pubs with mixed results, but in the decade since then he has emerged as a shrewd property speculator.
He capitalised on the glut of foreclosures in the US and bought up seafront houses in Miami that needed a bit of love a few years back. He would do them up – they were often 1930s builds that needed complete remodelling – and then sell them on for multiples of what he bought them for.
[caption id="attachment_417909" align="alignright" width="163"] Eddie Irvine[/caption]
The latest such prospect is 126 West San Marino Drive in Miami Beach. It has been sold for over $17 million by Irvine’s man on the ground in Florida, Julian Johnston, who tells me that it’s a sale price that equates to $2,300 a square foot.
It’s not quite the $20 million Irvine was hoping for when it went on the market but it’s still close to treble what a company controlled by him bought it for in 2015, which was just under $6 million.
In the last three years, Johnston has flogged about $60 million-worth of beach-front property in this area of San Marino, one of a chain of man-made islands in the Biscayne Bay called the Venetians, an area which is a particular favourite of Irvine’s.
Speaking of islands, Irvine lives on a private island in the Bahamas that he developed from scratch, sometimes taking to a digger himself, to build a luxury retreat in the location where some of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies were filmed.
In less palm-fringed property development news, Irvine recently told Property Week that he is ramping up his interests in his native North, now that prices are inching up there.
[caption id="attachment_417910" align="alignnone" width="300"] Paul Tweed: kept busy with social media work Pic: Stephen Davison/Pacemaker[/caption]
A Zambia-based business family has launched a High Court action in Dublin against Facebook in what is likely to be part of a growing trend.
The Yousuf family, who have investments in mining, energy and consumer goods in Africa and the Middle East, are seeking the removal of material on Facebook that they say is defamatory and are also considering seeking damages.
“Facebook has been repeatedly requested to take down untrue and highly defamatory material but has failed to do so, leaving our client no alternative but to seek the assistance of the courts,” their lawyer, Paul Tweed, tells me. (Facebook’s legal team acknowledged the case, but didn’t want to comment further.)
Best known for pursuing print publications like the National Enquirer on behalf of Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez, Tweed has pivoted now to focus more on defamation actions against Facebook, Twitter and other social giants. Last week, he told the New York Times that he thinks the sites should be treated in a similar way to publishers of newspapers and other traditional media in libel matters.
Social media behemoths are increasingly finding themselves caught in the crosshairs of regulators in relation to defamation and privacy issues for which they don’t have to answer to press complaints or advertising bodies in the way that traditional publications do. That means that often the only resort for those affected is the courts. If the social media companies don’t react faster to complaints, they could start getting legally clobbered.
In a similar move to the Yousufs, Liam McCaffrey, a director of a company formerly owned by Cavan businessman Sean Quinn, unleashed his own High Court action against Facebook last week. He is seeking to have taken down material posted on a Facebook page set up by supporters of the Quinn family that he thinks is libellous.
The problem is that, once the material is taken down by Facebook, similar pages simply crop up again in another guise, and the people behind them are difficult to trace. McCaffrey, whose company Quinn Industrial Holdings has previously taken Facebook to task on similar matters, took this High Court case after his lawyers wrote to Facebook several times, but made little progress in having the issue tackled, sources said.
Also being shaken out of its sleepy norms is the credit union movement.
While there is a long-held ambition to enter the mortgage and banking fields, and a more recent one to get involved in backing social housing, the Central Bank is seeking better governance, systems and attention to regulatory matters from the movement.
Patrick Casey, the Central Bank’s credit union registrar, is bypassing boards and even the main umbrella group, the Irish League of Credit Unions, and seeking to engage directly with the chief executives of the country’s biggest branches about setting up a chief executive steering committee that would drive future direction in a focused way.
Casey wrote to the chief executives of the country’s biggest credit unions recently and requested a response from them with their insights by this coming Tuesday.
Close observers see this as a sidelining of a rather sleepy League and the boards of directors of local credit unions in favour of a more dynamic way of getting things done.
 
A well-known Dublin business name was on the receiving end of a Nama legal suit recently.
For some time now, Nama has been pursuing cinema tycoon Tom Anderson over monies in a case dating back to 2015.Now Nama offshoot NALM has obtained a judgment against Anderson in the amount of €776,727, which I understand relates to a personal guarantee. Anderson denied owing the money at all when contacted, though clearly Nama disagrees.
The Andersons are a very well-known Dublin business dynasty who run cinemas north and south of the border, as well as having other private investments.
Another well known business family are the Beshoffs, since their ancestor Ivan Beshoff, the last known survivor of the Battleship Potemkin mutiny, arrived here in the early 20th century.
Jeremy Beshoff i a scion of the family best known for their legendary fish and chip shops.Nama initiated a High Court case against Beshoff Motors and Jeremy, a businessman with a luxury second-hand car dealership company in Howth.
Nama owns the dealership site, which is part of two sites assembled during the boom by Ray Grehan, just before the property market apocalypse in 2007.
Grehan paid a cool €62 million for the adjoining Techrete and Teeling sites. He had form for such zinging top-of-the-market deals, having already famously bought the former UCD veterinary college for a record price at the top of the market, though it soon slumped spectacularly.
The former Techrete plant is where Beshoff Motors is renting, which suited it fine during the years when you wouldn’t have had a hope in hell of selling the place. Now, though, I understand that Nama wants to sell this lucrative property on but is in dispute with Beshoff about the move.
The matter was due to go to mediation, but subsequently appeared before the courts. It has been adjourned until October.
[caption id="attachment_417911" align="alignnone" width="300"] Filip Syta, author of The Show[/caption]
Former Google Ireland staffer Filip Syta, whose racy, Penguin-published book based on a tech giant that is definitely not Google, but “inspired by real events”, as he puts it, has now had his tome made into a TV show, he tells me.
Syta worked at Google HQ Dublin for two years before leaving to pursue his dream to be an author and write The Show, a work of fiction about the party lifestyle at a multibillion search technology firm.
Now The Show is a glossy-looking TV series being streamed on Apple TV and Blackpills with plenty of topical (and scary) data-themed storylines.
“It’s about Big Tech’s collection of personal data, just like the current Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal in reality,” Syta says.

Highlight: At its world tour in London, the company focused on the fourth industrial revolution — the advent of AI, autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things and other similar technologies coming to the fore
Body


With more than 150,000 companies using its product, Salesforce brought the focus from the major players to the individuals using its services.
At its world tour in London, the company, which holds the number one position for CRM, sales, marketing and customer service platform, focused on the fourth industrial revolution — the advent of AI, autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things and other similar technologies coming to the fore — which its global chief marketing officer, Simon Mulcahy, said was more than just new technology coming through.
“This is a whole new world, [but] it’s not just a technology revolution, this is a revolution that is impacting every corner of society,” said Mulcahy. “This is changing how we talk and engage with each other. It’s changing politics and democracy; there’s a social revolution going on.
“This is a major trust and equality revolution and all of this is filtered into the world of business and in the world of business, it’s not just those factors, it’s the fact that now the customer demands to be in the centre.”
A key theme for Salesforce was focusing on the individuals who run and operate a business. Promoting its learning platform Trailhead while calling its key influencers Trailblazers, the company is planning to put certain users front and centre of its marketing campaign.
“It’s all about people,” said Mulcahy. “It’s people at every level of the organisation, who are the people who are going to drive this. It’s not necessarily the computer scientists. Who’s going to drive this revolution? It’s the average person who deeply understands their business and wants to drive this technology quickly.”
The focus on individuals ran throughout the entire day, with examples of individuals training up through its learning platform. That, as well as the focus on its new AI platform Einstein, which is designed to deliver predictions and recommendations based on a company’s processes, drove much of the proceedings.
“One practical element of it was whenever you look at an amazing story of customer transformation, there’s always a person behind it,” said Paul Smith, Salesforce EMEA’s executive vice president for cloud sales.
“You look at a business doing amazing work like Adidas and an individual who sits at the heart of it like a Joseph Godsey (Adidas’ head of digital brand commerce). He has a fantastic vision, energy, and skills to execute that vision and really transform how Adidas is doing one-to-one digital marketing and e-commerce at scale.”
Tying in with people is building up an ecosystem of Salesforce users helping each other out. By highlighting key influencers and dedicated users, it hopes that users will have the option of helping each other out in forums.
“The other piece focusing around trailblazers and marketing for us is around how can we help enable an ecosystem, how we can give people a career platform by enabling them on Salesforce,” said Smith.
“It’s fantastic when you see stories of people who have done a career pivot and they used Trailhead to re-skill and build a new career and we genuinely wanted to fuel that ecosystem as much as possible.”
Both Mulchay and Smith talked about Salesforce’s values and how it trickles down through the 1 per cent initiative, where employees for it and other companies give up 1 per cent of their time to good causes. The focus on ethics will continue to play a major role in how the company moves forward.
“Whenever I present to a customer, the first slide is always the values slide,” said Smith. “I always talk about trust as the number one value, we handle a massive amount of data for our customers and we need to do it more securely.
“What’s interesting is the resonance you get with customers when you talk about trust and customer success and innovation. Those are the kind of things that they expect from Salesforce.”

SBP editorial: Britain still muddling its way through Brexit talks

The European commissioner Michel Barnier recently warned the British government that negotiation should not be a game of hide and seek.
But with the crucial EU summit at the end of this month fast approaching, there are still worrying signs that the message is not getting through.
By now, there should have been a clear policy proposal from the British government about how it intends to avoid a hard border. Instead, however, British prime minister Theresa May is persisting with exploring two options – a customs partnership which would allow the British to keep negotiating their own trade deals, and a technological solution to border checks. But both of these were ruled out long ago by Barnier as solutions to the problem.
In the meantime, May’s disloyal cabinet ministers keep floating their own daft ideas. The latest is from Brexit secretary David Davis who wants to have a ten-mile “buffer zone” on the border so that local farmers and business people could keep North-South trade going. At the same time, the North would stay in the EU and in the British market.
Even May’s coalition partners, the DUP, were quick to recognise that this was nonsense.
It is another sign of why there is no willingness in government to accept a temporary solution instead of the so-called backstop - the British government guarantee that it will maintain full alignment with the rules of the internal market and the customs union in the North unless there is a better option.
All of this uncertainty and division is continuing to damage Anglo-Irish relations, which had reached a high point with the historic visit of Queen Elizabeth II here in 2011. Now there appears to be no prospect of the British and Irish governments being able to restore power-sharing, at a time when the voice of the North is needed in Brussels more than ever.
The draft withdrawal deal has to be agreed between Britain and the EU by October, to give time for the European Parliament and the British Parliament to ratify it before Britain’s exit date in March next year.
If that deal cannot be done, then the agreed transition period of two years also falls away, and there is an instant hard Brexit.
It all points towards a serious confrontation at the EU summit in Brussels at the end of this month. Halting the negotiations with so little time left is a big risk. But there is no way that negotiations can be allowed to muddle on with this kind of muddled thinking from the British government.

SBP editorial: Time for economy to ‘lean against the wind’

The economic omens continue to darken and, to quote a speech given last week by Sharon Donnery, deputy governor of the Central Bank, Ireland may find itself needing to “lean against the wind” sooner than it thinks.
Just last week, credible figures from both inside Ireland and outside made well-reasoned arguments that the next economic calamity will happen sooner rather than later and that Ireland needs to prepare itself.
Last week, in a keynote address to the European Council on Foreign Relations, billionaire investor George Soros sounded a downbeat note, warning that “we may be heading for another major financial crisis”.
He told the audience that “until recently it could have been argued that the austerity is working and we must persevere with it because the European economy is slowly improving”. But he pointed out that Europe is facing a number of potential shocks, including the “termination of the nuclear arms deal with Iran and the destruction of the transatlantic alliance”, which he said “is bound to have a negative effect on the European economy and cause other dislocations”.
Meanwhile, Italy’s difficulties continue to bubble away, raising those tensions for Europe and the possibility for a wider economic and financial contagion.
Against this backdrop, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development took a close look at Ireland’s economy and found that - even if those external problems were not present - Ireland is not in a healthy state.
It warned that “some signs of overheating are emerging” in the economy, not least the strong rise of house prices and construction investment and recommended that “macro-prudential policy tools” already in place - that is, the Central Bank’s restrictions on lending - should be extended if necessary.
It warned of “uncertainties to the outlook”, not least the potential shock of Brexit, and said that inflation is likely to rise strongly.
“Risks to the outlook are elevated,” the OECD noted, including “another property bubble associated with a strong surge in credit growth” with “persistently high private indebtedness also [posing] a downside risk”.
Ireland, it noted, is sensitive to rising interest rates, which are on the agenda for both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
But perhaps the most cogent argument was put forward by Donnery last week when she warned that “events beyond our control or influence will continue to shape developments in the domestic macro-financial environment”.
She pointed out that the current economic picture is generally positive, but that “certain challenges remain as a legacy of the last crisis”, including the “extent of long-term mortgage arrears and the relatively high levels of private and public debt”.
Donnery made it clear that the things that make Ireland’s economy strong - its openness and flexibility - are also weaknesses. In the same vein, she pointed out that all of the recent signs of growth in Ireland - “the relatively low unemployment rate, the continuing rise in real estate prices and the turn in the credit cycle” - could also be interpreted as warnings that the cycle could be about to turn.
She described them as “indicative of potential emerging cyclical risks” and noted that “we know from the experience of the mid-2000s that strong cyclical growth can lend itself to imbalances. These imbalances make households, businesses and banks more vulnerable to negative shocks.”
So what should Ireland do? Both Donnery and the OECD agree that Ireland needs to keep its course, but do so in a more prudent, cautious manner.
Donnery also recommended that Irish banks should build up countercyclical capital buffers - extra cash and assets - to help them ‘lean against the wind’ in any future crisis.
The same principle applies to Ireland’s budgetary measures. Reckless talk from the likes of Sinn Féin about reducing the amount it would put into the so-called Rainy Day Fund should be ignored - in a crisis we will need a robust bailout fund at our disposal.
In short, Ireland needs to heed Donnery’s words and prepare itself to lean against the wind.

SF strikes conciliatory tone towards Varadkar in private correspondence
Sunday Business Post

Length: 889 words
Byline: Hugh O'Connell
Highlight: Newly-released emails reveal that despite criticising him in public, Sinn Féin representatives were more positive when corresponding privately with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar 
Body


Sinn Féin TDs wrote to Leo Varadkar to congratulate him on his election as Taoiseach and to commend him for “hitting all the right notes” in a speech last year, newly released correspondence shows.
Despite being heavily critical of Varadkar’s government publicly, emails released by the Department of the Taoiseach strike a different tone. They show how Sinn Féin representatives regularly requested meetings with the Taoiseach to discuss the situation in the North.
Varadkar was also lobbied by Sinn Féin TDs, including former leader Gerry Adams and his successor, Mary Lou McDonald, about local and national issues.
In total, 117 pieces of correspondence were exchanged between the Taoiseach’s office and Sinn Féin representatives in Varadkar’s first ten months in office.
The first of these was a letter from Sinn Féin TD Pat Buckley congratulating Varadkar on the day he became Taoiseach in June of last year. “I hope we can work together in the future on many important matters,” Buckley wrote.
The Cork East TD asked if Varadkar could make “some kind of gesture of recognition” towards Midleton independent councillor Noel Collins, who had recently completed 50 years of service on the council.
In another letter sent last August, Sinn Féin deputy David Cullinane praised Varadkar for a speech he made about the future of Waterford. “I wish to commend you for the important speech you made,” Cullinane wrote. “It hit all the right notes and highlighted the important issues facing our city and county.”
Cullinane said Waterford had received similar assurances before and that the city needed government support for infrastructure projects such as the North Quays development.
“Waterford will not double its population in 20 years if it does not have a university, a functioning airport, a fully resourced regional hospital or appropriate level of office accommodation and high-end retail in the city,” Cullinane wrote.
Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty wrote to Varadkar last September about the proposal to repurpose Nama in a bid to tackle the housing crisis.
The Donegal TD said he was glad to hear Varadkar’s party had “come to realise that resources available to the state like Nama need to be activated in a strategy to create supply”.
Doherty attached a copy of legislation to give effect to such changes to Nama. Varadkar responded to Doherty last October to say that, while no decisions had been taken, Doherty’s proposal would be considered.
Some TDs were not as warm in their correspondence. The party’s housing spokesman, Eoin Ó Broin, sent a terse letter to Varadkar last January with a copy of Sinn Féin’s press releases on housing. “I look forward to hearing your feedback on the recommendations contained within the documents,” he said. There is no record of Varadkar responding to Ó Broin.
In another letter, Ó Broin asked the Taoiseach to respond directly to a handwritten letter from an 11-year-old Girl Guide in Lucan who was “shocked to hear that our government have ignored the problem” of climate change. Ó Broin asked Varadkar to outline to the girl what the government was doing to address climate change.
Ó Broin also complained to the Ceann Comhairle’s office about comments the Taoiseach made about Sinn Féin housing policy at Leaders’ Questions last December, calling for the Dáil record to be corrected.
The correspondence also reveals that both Adams and his successor, Mary Lou McDonald, have frequently written to the Taoiseach to lobby him on various issues. Adams contacted Varadkar in relation to the murder of Garda Tony Golden, the migrant situation in Libya, reform of the Seanad, and the provision of respite care services.
Meanwhile, McDonald wrote to the Taoiseach last year about a home care package for a woman whose discharge from Cavan Hospital was being delayed and about providing a specific drug to children with a type of muscular dystrophy.
She also copied Varadkar in on correspondence to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, about funding shortages for an after-school project in Dublin’s north inner city. McDonald also contacted the Taoiseach about a stalled construction project at the Naomh Fionnbarra GAA club in Cabra and the proposed Magdelene Laundries memorial on Sean McDermott Street in Dublin.
The Sinn Féin leader’s office has also regularly contacted Varadkar’s office to arrange discussions about the situation in the North, where there has been no executive for nearly 18 months.
One request on behalf of McDonald last February read: “Over the phone will do, but she would obviously be up for a meeting, should the Taoiseach wish to do this. She is flexible on all of this time-wise.”
Another email asked for a meeting with Varadkar in either Washington DC or New York while he was on St Patrick’s Day business in the US, and there was another meeting sought with him in relation to the North last April.
McDonald’s office also contacted the Taoiseach’s private secretary about setting up a meeting with EU Council president Donald Tusk when he was in Dublin last March.
The correspondence, which was released under freedom of information, also details how McDonald’s office contacted the Taoiseach’s private secretary last March to flag up that the Sinn Féin leader would be speaking in Irish during Dáil questions on the Irish language, “just so the Taoiseach is aware”.

Shannon-based Celestial Aviation Trading 38 Ltd is being sued by the families of 11 people who died in a horrific crash when the aircraft they were in tried to land in Rostov-on-Don, Russia.
Celestial Aviation was the owner of the Boeing 737-800 that crashed while being operated by FlyDubai, the Emirati state-owned low cost carrier.
Celestial is being sued by the next of kin of 11 of the 62 people who died in the crash including the families of two children.
About 22 cases in total are being taken with each of the next-of-kin family members appointing Dublin-based Simon McAleese Solicitors to represent them in Ireland.
The cases are part of broader multi-jurisdiction legal actions against multiple parties associated with the crash being run out of the United States.
The crash in March 2016 occurred at night as the plane descended towards Rotov-on-Don airport, destroying the aircraft and killing all passengers and crew when it hit the ground at 600 kilometres per hour.
Accounts for Celestial Aviation Trading 38 Ltd show that it is owned by GE Capital Aviation Services Ltd and had accumulated profits of $120 million.
In a statement not long after the crash the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), which is investigating the crash, said the plane had been flown in a contradictory manner in the minutes before it crashed.
The IAC, in a preliminary report, said the crew had decided to abort an initial landing and circled around to try again with the plane gaining altitude before the controls of the plane pushed its nose lower.
The IAC said this, combined with the angle of its tail fin, sent the aircraft into a steep dive which it did not pull out of.
No conclusions were definitively drawn by investigators as to the cause of the crash in their preliminary report.

Smurfit Kappa subsidiary in Colombia fights claim by farmer over land sale

Byline: Barry J Whyte
Body


A subsidiary of Smurfit Kappa is appealing the decision of a Colombian court that it should give back a nearly 80-hectare farm to a family called the Riveras.
A court in the Colombian city of Cali ruled in favour of the Riveras, who were claiming restitution of the 78-hectare farm in Bolívar in Valle del Cauca, a region in the west of Colombia, on the grounds that they had been forced sellers due to the violence in the region at the time.
The action was taken against a company called Reforestadora, a subsidiary of Cartón de Colombia, under Colombia’s Victims and Land Restitution Law.
The purpose of the law was to make restitution to Colombians who had been forcibly displaced by paramilitaries and the security forces over the course of the armed conflict in the country.
The Rivera family took the case back in 2015, initially to a land restitution court, the Cali Land Restitution Court. The family wanted their former lands restored to them because they claimed that they had only sold the lands under duress from local paramilitaries.
The court agreed and the subsidiary appealed the decision but in August of last year a higher court - the High Court Civil Cassation Chamber - ruled against the company’s appeal, concluding that “the decision in dispute does not look whimsical, capricious or subjective, so that the claim of the petitioner does not find receipt in this exceptional venue”.
In March, after another appeal by the Smurfit subsidiary, a court in the city of Cali upheld the decision that Cartón de Colombia should return the land to the Rivera family.
The judges in the case ruled that while Cartón de Colombia did not exercise any violence themselves or act in concert with any armed groups to acquire the lands, they had lacked “necessary diligence” in verifying the reasons the family was selling.
Since then, Cartón de Colombia has appealed the decision and asked Colombia’s Constitutional Court - which rules on matters of interpretation of the constitution and has the power to determine the constitutionality of laws - to review the decision.
In a statement by the company’s legal counsel, reported in the Colombian media, the company said: “We believe that the evidence in the file was clear and was not duly assessed by the court. The company in the land purchase process is very rigorous and this case was no exception.”
The company did not comment when contacted by The Sunday Business Post.

Smyths Toys to start buying ex-Toys R Us stores in Britain

Smyths Toys, the Galway-headquartered international retailer, will seek to snap up former Toys R Us stores in Britain bringing the number of branches it owns there to almost 100 stores this year.
Smyths, which is buying the former Toys R Us central European business, plans to add eight new stores in Britain this year and more next year and many of these will be former Toys R Us branches, according to a source with knowledge of its plans.
The Toys R US bankruptcy administrator has started selling off the British stores and leases.
Smyths does not plan at this stage to pursue the entirety of what is being sold as the Duke portfolio, a collection of 31 freehold and leasehold sites formerly owned by Toys R Us and being offered for sale or lease. Instead it will seek to cherry-pick selected stores that suit its strategic needs.
The number of advisers involved in the massive liquidation of the American toy retailer, which collapsed into insolvency has made it difficult to obtain a decision on some potential acquisitions by Smyths, the same source said.
Smyths is currently embarking on a huge integration process to add the 93 Toys R US stores and online businesses in Germany, Austria and Switzerland that it bought for €80 million and is converting into Smyths Toys branches. That deal brings its total number of stores to about 200.
Smyths had been planning to open in the Netherlands before the Toys R US opportunity came up. Adding the central Europe Toys R Us business to its operation means Smyths is now a substantially in excess of €1 billion business.
It makes close to 20 per cent of its sales from either online delivery or click and collect.
Getting the central Europe acquisition working is going to concentrate energies for the next while, including the huge IT transformation that this requires. After that, the Smyths brothers may turn further attention to adding more acquisitions or more territories to its business.
Born and raised above the family shop on Main Street in Claremorris in Mayo, the Smyths brothers opened their first toy shop in a basement off Eyre Square in Galway in 1986.
Tony and Padraig run the business, with Tony running the commercial side while Padraig handles the buying end. Younger brothers Tommie and Liam are shareholders and directors.
There are now 21 stores in the Republic of Ireland, seven in the North and almost 90 in Britain.

Social media: A powerful visual tool for interior design

Highlight: Interior design and architecture is very much a visual product, so we looked to image-based social tools like Instagram and Pinterest as the bread and butter of our social traffic, writes Louise Rankin of NORTH
Body


An estimated 80 per cent of smartphone users check their phone when they wake up. It’s an astonishing number of people who have a yearning to see the information they missed whilst they slept before they’ve even brushed their teeth.
However, it’s precisely that high demographic that prompted us, when we decided to launch our business, NORTH, to make social media the vehicle at the forefront of our marketing plan.
Interior design and architecture is very much a visual product, so we looked to image-based social tools like Instagram and Pinterest as the bread and butter of our social traffic.
Being in a creative industry, the images of our work that we share are very much considered. If a designer and their client have just created a beautiful space together, a badly composed photograph will not depict the space the same way that the naked eye does. It takes a tenth of a second to form a visual impression, so getting the image (or images) right is critical.
[caption id="attachment_417844" align="alignleft" width="703"] A Scandinavian style bedroom for a bright, fresh space to rest Pic: PJ Rankin[/caption]
The beauty of the online medium is that we have an unlimited amount of inspirational resources at our fingertips. Gone are the days of waiting for the weekly or monthly publication for new inspiration or to learn of the latest trends.
That said, browsing magazines and newspapers for interior design tips is still a popular pastime for homeowners. A lot of our clients helpfully still show us cuttings from various publications. For many, cuttings are just a more tangible experience, one that’s more condensed rather than the overwhelming task of scrolling through thousands of images on Pinterest.
So why are social platforms like Instagram so popular?
As our brains process images 60,000 times faster than words, we’re able to absorb hundreds of perfectly styled living spaces we see whilst scrolling monotonously through our feeds, quicker than if we were to read about them. With this in mind, the power of imagery for us when we founded NORTH was incredibly important.
To be able to make someone stop scrolling and feel inspired by a photograph of our work is always our goal. Humans now apparently have a mere eight-second attention span, so we have to aim for perfection with every photo. These social tools are also one of the biggest factors in influencing trends today, whether it’s for interiors, fashion, food or fitness. Although the value of word-of-mouth referrals is high, trends spread like wildfire on Instagram and Facebook because they’re quickly shared and easily viewed. All businesses have to keep up with the times, and social channels are great for staying in the know.
There is also the added benefit of posting a photograph of your work which may incorporate a trend, and which other people will re-share on their accounts, which ultimately increases brand awareness and hopefully, your social following too.
So, for those looking for visual inspiration this weekend, here are some Instagram accounts we recommend for eye-catching designs: @elledecorationuk, @image_interiors, @ruthmariaphotos, @nathaliemc and @yellowtrace.
Louise Rankin is a co-founder and design director of Dublin-based design studio NORTH, with co-founder and creative director Lauren Martin. Visit their website at northdesign.ie or follow them on Instagram: @northdesign.ie

Pat Breen, the Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, visited Spearline HQ in Skibbereen last month on the official launch of the firm’s new GDPR operational compliance software solution, Spearline Data Protection.
This software was developed in west Cork by a fleet of legal, product and software experts recruited by Spearline’s data protection software company, Spearline Risk and Compliance.
“I would like to congratulate Spearline on the launch of their new GDPR software solution. It is always heartening to see an Irish company at the forefront of technological developments, particularly at regional level,” said Breen.
“This is a key time in the development of data protection protections and as Minister for Data Protection, I am very conscious of the desire among organisations of all types to be GDPR compliant. I hope Spearline’s new product can help them to be confident of the data protection measures they have in place.”
Spearline was established in 2003 and has a global presence in 60 countries, working with some of the world’s most influential businesses.
The inception of Spearline Risk and Compliance came about in response to the growing demand for data protection software solutions, and this development has Spearline on track to grow staff numbers to 100 by the end of 2018.
“This new piece of EU legislation has been written to prioritise the rights of each EU citizen and the use of their data.
“Our software solution Spearline Data Protection has been created for organisations to uphold their GDPR compliance responsibilities in a straightforward way. It is a pivotal time in the world of data protection and we are delighted to be in the thick of it,” said Ciara Lucy, managing director of Spearline Risk and Compliance.

The government’s controversial communications unit was given an advance preview of how one of the Project Ireland 2040 advertorials in a national newspaper would be displayed, new emails show.
The Department of the Taoiseach’s Strategic Communications Unit (SCU) has been forced to wind-down following a controversy about the paid-for content in national and regional newspapers promoting the national development plan earlier this year.
The government has insisted that the SCU did not have pre-approval of the content before it appeared in newspapers. But one email thread reveals that the managing director of the company hired to promote the plan forwarded a partial screengrab of the Project Ireland 2040 advertorial in the Irish Times to staff in the SCU the day before it was published.
PHD media’s Jason Nebenzahl asked SCU officials, including its director John Concannon: “Are you okay with this, we will make it by deadline which is good? I think it looks good.” An official in the SCU responded: “That’s good Jason, many thanks.”
The emails also detail contact between Nebenzahl and journalists working on the commercial content that would appear in the Irish Times.
One journalist said he had been unable to get any assistance from the government press office and had been told by one official there that they would not be able to help “until I can tell them who in the Department of the Taoiseach has authorised/commissioned the report”.
Another journalist who emailed Nebenzahl said he had contacted the government press office but was referred back to PHD. The journalist noted that the press office “seemed a little cagey despite this being paid-for content”. Nebenzahl forwarded the email to Concannon and other SCU officials asking how to proceed.
He said he had sent those who has asked for quotes and access “back to the government press office as this is the official channel for access and quotes”. One SCU staff member responded to Nebenzahl saying he would contact the journalist himself.
The emails also show PHD forwarding copies of draft scripts for radio spots on local stations to officials in the SCU. The radio campaign was later dropped after the controversy over newspaper ads.
The SCU is being disbanded following the Project Ireland 2040 controversy on the recommendation of Martin Fraser, the country’s top civil servant.
Following a review of the unit, Fraser found no evidence that the civil service code was breached to promote Fine Gael politicians but given the sustained criticism from opposition parties it was decided the unit should be wound down.
Concannon is to lead the wind-down of the unit, which will see its functions reverting to the old Government Information Service with a smaller budget, fewer staff and a more limited role. This is likely to be completed next month.

Still no barrier to anonymous sperm donors as new law on ice since 2015

Highlight: It is estimated that there are hundreds of donor-conceived children being born every year. But those conceived through anonymous sperm donations are at risk of unknowingly meeting their siblings in the future
Body


The government has failed to ban anonymous sperm donations – despite the necessary legislation being passed three years ago.
It comes after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar criticised Catholic adoption agencies for falsifying birth certificates to make it appear that adoptive parents were the birth ones. He said that it had robbed children of their identity.
But the government still has not implemented the 2015 legislation to ban anonymous sperm donations.
The Child and Family Relationships Act 2015 had provided for this, as well as the setting up of a national register of donor-conceived children. This would allow them to find out the name and address of their donor father or mother when they reached the age of 18, as well as genetically related siblings.
It is estimated that there are hundreds of donor-conceived children being born every year. But those conceived through anonymous sperm donations are at risk of unknowingly meeting their siblings in the future.
The biggest supplier of anonymous sperm donations to Irish fertility clinics is the Danish-based Cryos International, which operates the world’s largest sperm bank.
The Irish Times reported last year how the Irish Fertility Society, which represents clinics here, has lobbied the government to postpone the ban on anonymous sperm donations.
It said that it will lead to a rise in women buying sperm from foreign donor banks and using it in their homes without medical supervision.
The Department of Health has missed several deadlines to implement the new law. It first said that it needed time for a “transition period”.
A spokesman for Health Minister Simon Harris said he was conscious of the need to implement the bill as soon as possible. “The discussions with the Attorney General are at an advanced stage,” he said.
A study in the Journal of Human Reproduction found that 82 per cent of donor-conceived children hoped to make contact with their donor. The most frequent reason was because they were curious about their donor’s physical appearance.
There are ongoing discussions between the would-be parents of donor-conceived children on the Rollercoaster.ie website about using anonymous sperm donations.
“We have an anonymous donor so there is no chance the child could find out about the donor, even if we told them how they were conceived. Cannot think of any reason to tell them,” wrote one contributor recently.
Another contributor on the website wrote: “My question is – how much do they match donors to the couple? We plan to keep the whole process anonymous so we would like a child that would have similar characteristics.”
But last month Minister of State Jim Daly told the Seanad that officials had identified a small number of ‘drafting issues’ with the legislation.
“The implications of these issues are being explored by my officials and the Office of the Attorney General,” he said.
Daly has committed to preparing new legislation, if it is needed, to set up the register of donor-conceived children.
Sinn Féin senator Fintan Warfield has complained that the delay in implementing the law is preventing the donor-conceived children of lesbian and gay parents from getting an Irish passport or Irish citizenship.

Highlight: Most businesses don’t use telephony services, but Intellicom aims to change all that, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body


I think it’s market awareness, and a bit of fear as well,” Neil Wisdom, managing director of Intellicom, said when talking about why people might be reluctant to install cloud telephony for their business.
“People who use Skype to ring their brother in Australia . . . where you generally get poor quality that breaks up. That’s because it’s a consumer free product using basic internet services and there’s no quality of service.”
It’s not the sole reason why most businesses don’t take up telephony services, but it does play a role. The infrastructure around cloud telephony usually requires a good broadband connection to work, yet Intellicom is seeing growth in the number of businesses installing it, with Wisdom describing it as an “exponentially growing curve”.
“We’re seeing a lot of options and migrations from on-premise systems into cloud-based systems, and it definitely has an impact on the infrastructure so broadband is the absolute pre-requisite,” he said.
“[However], there’s a lot of fear and doubt, uncertainty and doubt that the carriers are putting out there, which in my view is muddying the waters and giving inappropriate information.
“There are various references to broadband speeds but in many cases, they ignore the fact that that’s the download speed and with cloud services, the upload speeds are just as important as you’re pushing information from the office to the cloud, you’re also pulling information from the cloud back down to the office.”
The problem is, and noticeable for many people using any broadband service, is that the upload speeds tend to be a fraction of what the download speeds are. For telephony to be adopted by the mainstream, it requires connections that have equal download and upload speeds or asymmetrical.
It can be a pity, as the benefits of telephony for a business can be significant, taking away much of the pain that surrounds traditional phone line structures.
“One thing about VOIP and cloud services is that it removes the geographical dependence you have on a physical office location,” he said. “Traditionally a phone system on a wall and it services just that office. If you open another office in another county or country, you have to set up another phone system and put it on the wall of that office.
“Whereas for telephony, as long as you have a good quality broadband link into all your offices, you have one virtual phone system in the cloud and you can deploy home users, offices where you want around the world.”
It has seen the company set up installations in places like New York, Milan and Warsaw, to name a few. Alongside the security element, which uses configuration and controls like firewalls to protect it, its failover and resilience measures allow for offices to relocate and set up elsewhere if a major problem happens like flooding or fire.
“[If that happens] they need to be able to send their staff home or send them to a nominated location to keep them located,” he said. “For cloud telephony, all they have to do is move their telephone handset. As long as they have a decent broadband link, they can work as normal.”

Buyers looking for a spacious mews property in Ballsbridge will be interested in the private treaty sale of 57 Heytesbury Lane, which is new to the market through Bracken Estates.
Concealed behind a brick wall with an electric security shutter, this stylish three-bedroom townhouse extends to 197 square metres over two levels and comes to the market in prime condition.
It is likely to appeal to empty nesters trading down from larger period homes in the area. Affluent young couples will also be impressed by the layout and the location; local shops and restaurants and prestigious schools are within easy reach, while the city centre is a 15-minute walk away. The area is well served by bus routes, while Landsowne Road Dart station is within strolling distance.
The accommodation at ground level is accessed off a light-filled entrance hallway with guest WC and an understairs storage area. Floored in polished maple, this bright area gives access to both the kitchen and the interconnecting living and dining areas, all of which are also fitted with maple floors.

CV: Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh]#
Age: 39
From: Kilkenny, living in London
Role: inventor and founder of Sugru
Family: married with two sons
Favourite movie: Kes
Last book read: Naked, by David Sedaris
It’s far too soon for Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh to think about lessons, about what she can take from this experience in order to improve, or advise others. Right now it’s about securing the future, it’s about making sure what she has spent her entire professional life on keeps going.
That thing is Sugru, a type of mouldable glue that for a time made her the most celebrated of Irish entrepreneurs.
Sugru was born in 2004, with the product first going to market in 2009. A year later, it was recognised by Time magazine as the 22nd best invention in 2010 – the iPad trailed behind it at 34.
Next Thursday, Ní Dhulchaointigh will attend the European Inventor of the Year awards in Paris – the first ever Irish nominee – having been shortlisted for her work on the product.
And yet the company behind it, FormFormForm, is today seen as a failure. After 14 years of work, Jane Ní Dhulchaointigh had to make a tough call last month to sell the business to German adhesives giant Tesa for £7.6 million (€8.7 million), resulting in a 90 per cent loss for investors.
Just how did it come to this?
Originally, Ní Dhulchaointigh studied sculpture at NCAD and then product design at the Royal College of Art in London.
“It was while I was studying in London that I came up with the idea for Sugru,” she says. “It was a happy accident. I was a bit disillusioned with the idea of designing new products when maybe we have enough stuff in the world. I didn’t want to be a contributing factor to a wasteful, consumerist society.
“I was thinking about how I could use my skills to find an alternative. It was quite accidental, I was just playing around with materials. The natural thing for me to do, because my background is in sculpture, is to make things with my hands.
“I was playing around with silicone and waste wood-dust one day. I made this mixture that most people wouldn’t have given a second thought but, for me, the properties of the material, being flexible and bouncy but also bonded to other materials, made it fascinating.”
From there she worked on finding ways to turn her invention into a viable business.
“While I was at college, it remained a concept I could prototype. After that, I teamed up with Roger Ashby, an entrepreneur, who helped me set up the business and find the right scientists to develop the technology around it.”
After five years of research, filing patents, refining the product and getting organised, it was time for Sugru to hit the market online. The world had changed substantially from the boomtime of its conception phase to being in the midst of the recession when Sugru launched. This ended up being of benefit to the business.
“It was a big turning point when we realised there were people out there looking for solutions to make things and fix things,” says Ní Dhulchaointigh.
“When I was developing the technology and pitching to investors, people thought I was nuts. It was only after the financial crash and that cultural shift that happened, where people started thinking they didn’t need as much stuff, that it began to take off. People became more environmentally conscious.”
The success online led to Sugru being one of the first businesses to seek and receive a substantial amount of money through crowdfunding, raising £3.4 million (€3.9 million) in May 2015.
“Crowdfunding seemed like a natural step and fix for us. Our whole approach to building the product and getting it out there was community-driven, so we grew quite a passionate following,” says Ní Dhulchaointigh.
“When we were looking to expand and grow we needed capital, and crowdfunding seemed a natural approach. We were early adopters of it and when we did it, that was one of the biggest raises at the time.”
In April this year, she was shortlisted for a European Inventor Award nomination.
“It’s pretty amazing to be recognised,” she says. “It’s incredible. It’s recognising inventions that are making a difference for the environment and socially as well as people in business. It’s great for me and motivating for our team.
“It’s humbling to be the first Irish person to be nominated. Sugru is quite a humble little invention – it’s not a big attention-grabbing thing. It’s a small fix that fits into people’s lives that makes things easier or keeps things going longer.
“We’re not really thinking about winning or losing. We’re just so honoured to be a finalist and included on the list. That’s more than enough.”
Unfortunately, though, it is not enough for consumers.
Ní Dhulchaointigh is still at a loss to know just what went wrong with the business.
A year ago, the company was targeting 50 per cent growth. This was ambitious but not far off what had already been happening for it. Double-digit growth had been the norm.
“A lot of our growth has been online and that has continued. We struggled in 2017 to secure the retailers that we had planned to and needed to. We have a successful retail customer with Target nationwide across the US, so we had every reason to believe we could replicate that,” she says.
“Unfortunately there’s no one simple answer as to why we haven’t been able to do it. The deal with Tesa is one that will help us develop a more successful retail model. As an independent company, the cost of driving awareness and demand has been more expensive than any of us imagined.
“We know the demand for Sugru is global, we sell in 170 countries online, and it’s been a challenge to know how to expand in Europe with so many languages, so much complexity. Tesa isn’t well known in Britain and Ireland for historical reasons, but they are first or second in most European countries. The investment that they will be making is exactly what it needs.”
The accounts for FormFormForm, however, tell a stark story. Sales were certainly growing – they rose from £3.5 million to £4.5 million between 2015 and 2016, for example – but losses were rising just as fast.
In the same year, the company had costs of £7.7 million, with its loss for the year rising from £2.2 million to £3.3 million, and its accumulated losses were pushed to £8.7 million at the end of 2016. In short, Sugru was certainly fun – and people thought it was a great invention – but it just wasn’t selling enough.
By the end of that period it had raised £8.7 million from investors – mostly small retail investors, mostly through crowdfunding – and it had £2.5 million of debt.
It had an agreement to draw down another £1.5 million from Clydesdale Bank, but that line of funding was pulled by the bank and the company was forced to raise a further £2 million from investors – and all the while the move to bricks and mortar retailers was struggling.
For Ní Dhulchaointigh, working through these past few months has been taxing.
“It’s been incredibly challenging. Sugru is an extremely positive product and we’ve never had to give anybody bad news before. That’s been a big challenge for us, on top of having to deal with the business challenges themselves,” she says.
“It’s financially disappointing for everybody involved. We needed to acknowledge that and support our shareholders and employees. We had to manage that. The future for the product and team is now secured, which is fantastic. To have an invention that is being recognised at such a level and for it to now have a solid footing is a good thing.
“The news is all so recent, it’s still difficult. We are very much in the middle of managing a challenging transition. For me, it’s just about working closely with the team. In a few months or a year, I might think about the lessons, but right now I have to be in the present and look at securing the business.”
For all the recent blows, Ní Dhulchaointigh remains upbeat in her outlook and urges young people to focus on something they love when going into business for themselves.
“I always encourage any young person to find the thing that they are really feeling passionate about. There’s a lot of hype around start-up things, but the most important thing with any business or invention is to find something you feel strongly about, where it will make a difference for more than yourself,” she says.
“Building a business or getting an invention out into the world, is going to be incredibly challenging and take a lot of time and energy. A key piece of advice I got at a critical stage in my journey was to start small and make it good. Pay attention to getting it right when it’s small. The scaling is the challenging piece.”
Ní Dhulchaointigh has taken her knocks, but has a chance to keep fighting. She is heading up the Sugru business within Tesa and is determined to prove the efforts made to date matter.
“There have been 15 years of blood, sweat and tears. Not just from myself, but from a growing team of people who have worked so hard to develop the business and the science. You can’t imagine all the work that’s been done,” she says.
“It’s important that we honour all of that work and go on to make it a success, even more so now that our shareholders haven’t had the return that any of us hoped.
“The priority for the next six months to a year is to get off to a great start with Tesa. We’re already working with them on expansion plans into Europe along with the advertising campaigns. Those projects and the team, integrating them, are going to be the main focus for me for the next few months.”

Supreme Court rebuffs legal challenge by ILP shareholders

Highlight: The affected stakeholders applied for a leapfrog appeal directly from the High Court, having lost proceedings last July against the Minister for Finance over the €4 billion state injection of funds to Permanent TSB from July 2011
Body


The Supreme Court has refused to hear an urgent challenge brought by a group of shareholders against the state’s recapitalisation of Irish Life & Permanent during the financial crisis.
The affected stakeholders applied for a leapfrog appeal directly from the High Court, having lost proceedings last July against the Minister for Finance over the €4 billion state injection of funds to Permanent TSB from July 2011, a move which effectively wiped out the value of their shares.
“Swift judicial finality” was sought by the shareholders in a case which ran for six and a half years and involved a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on a point of law.
While the High Court said the case raised issues of “exceptional public importance” transcending the interests of the shareholders, the Supreme Court concluded that changed circumstances meant the proceedings no longer had “systemic importance for the Irish financial sector and consequently the Irish economy”.
The bailout arose from the “emergency” Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act of 2010, legislation that has now lapsed under a sunset clause, making it inapplicable to future cases.
The Supreme Court said it was not satisfied that exceptional circumstances existed in the case that would justify a departure from the normal course of appeal, in the lower Court of Appeal.
Hedge fund manager Piotr Skoczylas of Scotchstone Capital, a former director of Permanent TSB, was one of the shareholders driving the legal action.
It has sparked offshoot proceedings, including a Constitutional challenge and a multimillion-euro damages claim, which can only be determined when the main case is finalised.
The claim made by the stakeholders was that the government could have adopted less extreme measures to bail out the bank which would have resulted in less damage to their interests.
Despite them losing the epic legal battle, Ms Justice Iseult O’Malley departed from standard procedure by awarding the different shareholders between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of their costs and outlays.
The grounds of appeal included claims that the High Court incorrectly applied European law, particularly in relation to the key EU law principle of proportionality.
Defending the lower court’s decision, Permanent TSB and state lawyers argued that the litigation brought by the shareholders was motivated solely by personal gain and lacked compelling public importance grounds to meet the threshold for a priority, leapfrog appeal.

Tech Gadget: Fujifilm goes back to the future with homage to Polaroid era

With summer here, the party gadgets are starting to hit the shelves, and Fujifilm has gone hard for the retro market with this Polaroid camera.
There’s nothing digital about this device, just good old-fashioned printed Polaroids.
There are three lenses to add to the flash to tint the shots, and the overall look of the images is heavily focused on that retro non-high-res feel.
The downside to this is that the images are pretty poor quality and there’s no way to save them. For festivals, this means that lugging around a bunch of prints could be a touch of a nuisance, not to mention the inability to share them.
That is somewhat the point of this device: it’s openly non-digital and is clearly for consumers wishing to eschew that aspect. It is still designed with selfies in mind, with a mini mirror on the front to make things easier.
The one issue that retro heads will have with this device is the viewfinder. It’s impractically small, so there’s definitely an unnecessary element of chance added to shots.
That aside, it’s not the worst piece of kit for its price. The camera is aesthetically pleasing, and will look cool at festivals or parties.
The 90-second development time isn’t too bad either, and it’s generally a bit of fun.
Finally, one small thing to note is the batteries.
In what seems mostly a move to keep the shape nice, the SQ6 uses CR2 batteries, not the first size or shape that comes to mind for most batteries.

The cud life

Highlight: Co Carlow farmer and author Lorna Sixsmith’s Till the Cows Come Home is the latest in a slew of best-selling books about the cud-chewing quadrupeds
Body


It was The Girl on the Train, or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Today, substitute the word ‘Cow’ for the word ‘Girl’ and you’re on to a good thing from a book publishing perspective. We’ve had Margaret Forster’s unsettling How to Measure a Cow; Rosamund Young’s explicitly bovine, best-selling The Secret Life of Cows; and Irish author John Connell’s debut, The Cow Book, a surprise hit of this year’s spring release schedule.
Now enter Lorna Sixsmith with Till The Cows Come Home, her ode to the monochrome milkers she tends to at home on the farm in Garrendenny,, Co Carlow.
Sixsmith is a farmer less predictable, having ditched a happily pensioned, holiday-rich teaching job in Britain to return to her Irish roots in pursuit of the rural idyll. This is is her fourth book (following Would You Marry a Farmer?, How to be a Perfect Farm Wife and An Ideal Farm Husband), and comes as the direct Irish reply to Rosamund Young’s ‘Secret Life’.
For Sixsmith, it’s an opportunity to recount memories of an Irish farming childhood and share the wonderful everyday of her current cleave to the land. Themes from farming etiquette to economics are explored, the writing ever returning to a simple affection for cows. “It’s not all about milk,” she writes. “It’s about seeing them (the cows) thrive and flourish, checking they are healthy, taking pleasure in seeing their contentment as they chew the cud and stroll into the milking parlour.”
When I called Sixsmith this week, it was around noon on the most glorious summer’s day in memory. It was, she agreed, a quite spectacular day to be a farmer.
“There is such a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction you get from farming, and then you get weather like this.The grass is green, the sky is blue, the animals are content and you are too. It makes you forget the bad days.”
That bad days were recently and cruelly visited upon the Irish farming community is not lost on the author. “It will definitely go down as the worst winter in some time,” she reflects. “So many farmers tell me they never remember a winter as long or as bad. We had enough fodder, but I felt so sorry for those who ran out of it earlier, and also those who were farming on their own. Farmers are quite proud, and like to think of themselves as being quite strong, but I’ve heard of discussion groups where farmers have broken down in tears. If you don’t have someone close to you, who understands what you’re going through, it can be difficult to maintain perspective.”
Sixsmith started her writing career online, first creating a blog, then concentrating on Twitter, where her respected take on modern farming issues, especially those related to female farmers, commands a considerable following.
She is today a proud ‘agvocate’; meaning an advocate for agriculture.
“It happened organically,” she says. “I didn’t set out to become a known voice. I started off blogging, then the first book, and the second, and then I got involved in some women-in-farming stuff. I had built up a good following on Twitter, so I was agvocating without thinking about it. Suddenly I realised, goodness, people are taking notice of what I’m saying.
“I do think it is important to advocate for farming,” she continues, “because there is a growing remove from rural to urban, with fewer people coming from a farming background nowadays. It’s important that people understand where food is coming from. There needs to be a reciprocal arrangement, and a reciprocal respect, between the farmer and the consumer. I’m not asking someone to thank me for going out to milk my cows, but at the same time I don’t want them to slate me for it.”
With regard to female farmers, Sixsmith believes it’s a case of a lot done, but more to do. “I came across a girl in her late teens recently, who wanted to farm,” she says. “And even though her brothers weren’t interested, she knew she wasn’t going to get the farm. I think that attitude among male farmers needs to be worked on. If my daughter doesn’t want to farm, that’s fine, but I don’t want her thinking that she can’t.”
She cites bias from both genders as a key challenge, and hopes for a perception shift. “I don’t want to say that women are overly lacking in self-confidence,” Sixsmith says, “but it is something that has come up in the research: that women don’t always see themselves as being farmers. And you must remember that women who do farm are running businesses, yet they can’t avail of the support you might see for other types of businesses; the women’s networking groups, mentoring and so on. They need this support, because when they go to the mart, or the discussion group, they are entering overwhelmingly male environments.”
Sixsmith is soon required outdoors, she explains, where she’ll work until 11pm. “Time off is two hours on a Sunday afternoon,” she laughs. “It’s part of it; you accept it. The advantage is that on certain special, sunny days, you can turn around to the kids and say, come on, let’s head up to the beach after the milking. We probably don’t do that as often as we should.”
Till The Cows Come Home is published by Black & White Publishing and available in all good bookshops now, priced £12.99
In this extract from Till the Cows Come Home, Lorna Sixsmith recounts early days and learning curves on Garrendenny farm
Garrendenny Farm has been home to the Sixsmiths for over one hundred years. When I left in 1987 to spread my wings, I never imagined myself back here, let alone farming. Yet, in July 2005, there I was, gasping for breath in the middle of a field trying to catch a runaway calf.
“Can you not run faster?” I heard Brian shout as I tried, in vain, to stop the calf. She raced past me, ignoring my waving arms. She slowed down a hundred yards from us, but still watched us carefully. Her head and tail were raised high, signifying she was ready to gallop again. I stopped to draw breath.
It was coming up to our third farming anniversary. We had just moved into the farmhouse and here we were on a Sunday morning, trying to retrieve a four-month-old calf from a neighbour’s field. Eighty calves had been put into Peter’s Field the previous day and, when herding them that morning, Brian noticed one was missing. Somehow, calf number 1342 had squeezed through the hedge and into a neighbour’s field. It was a large field divided into paddocks by electric wire; yearling Charolais cattle viewed us with some curiosity from one of them. The last thing we wanted was the calf getting in with them or running through another hedge into a further field. It would be impossible to retrieve her if that happened, so we absolutely had to get her back.
This was the third time we had tried to run her towards a corner, hoping that her brain would register it would be a good idea to squeeze back through the now enlarged gap in the hedge and rejoin her friends. So far it hadn’t worked. It wasn’t easy to round up a single calf – and this one was too flighty, too skittish, too fast. She had probably been stung by the electric wire too and was scared of it happening again.
“We’ll try again,” said Brian with the look of a man who was going to die trying. And I could tell Dad was just about to say, “It’ll never work,” when Brian went marching off again in pursuit of the runaway.
For a split second, I allowed myself to remember my pre-farming life. Sunday mornings were usually devoted to decorating or reading the newspapers over a leisurely breakfast. Even sanding architraves would be more relaxing than this. We used to reward our efforts with a pub lunch or a picnic in the New Forest, followed by a leisurely stroll for a couple of hours.
I groaned as I started to jog after Brian. I wasn’t fit; it was about four years since my last aerobics class. I wasn’t wearing a sports bra, my jeans were belt-less and kept slipping down and the ground was so rough I was convinced I’d break or sprain an ankle if I didn’t watch my step. I didn’t respond well to shouts from my husband to run faster either. I wasn’t cut out to be a farmer at all.
We created a semicircle around the calf, each of us holding out a stick to elongate our arms and try to create a barrier, and in this way we closed in on her slowly. Thankfully she took the hint and walked in the right direction as we whispered encouragement to her. We got closer this time; at last she was going towards the corner. We had enlarged the gap she had escaped through, and we had to just cross our fingers that she would go back through it. The other calves were at the other side of the hedge now, maybe their presence would encourage her. She walked closer and closer as we closed in tighter and tighter. She seemed to be concentrating on the other calves now rather than being wary of us. She climbed up the small incline and Brian raced forward to push her on further. We’d done it.
Calf number 1342 spent the rest of that summer with her comrades on the outfarm as I started to adjust to rural life, helping out at fundraisers, cooking for contractors and getting to know the neighbours. Two years later, as she had her first calf and entered the milking herd, our eldest child started primary school and I got a position on the school’s board of management. Was I starting to settle in to rural farming life after years of being a city girl?
Growing up as a farmer’s daughter, I developed a love for the land yet never saw myself becoming a farmer. In Ireland, as in many other countries, farms traditionally passed down the male line. My brother, Alden, was nine years younger than me. I just assumed he would take on the family farm. My extensive list of allergies – to dust mites, dairy products, grass pollens, straw and many other things – probably further indicated that farming wasn’t the best career choice. And I wanted to emigrate, to experience life outside of Crettyard, of Dublin and of Ireland. I didn’t want to marry a farmer, not because of the hard work and long hours, but because I’d have to live in the same place for decades. I wanted to spread my wings.
Yet, here I was back in Crettyard, destined to live in the same house for the next quarter of a century. Accustomed to renovating a house every two years and moving on, I sensed I’d be moving the furniture around frequently.
It’s true that the tie to the family farm is usually very strong because it has been passed down from generation to generation. No one wants to be the generation to sell that land. It’s a fact that farms in Ireland don’t come on the market as often as in other countries. Land exchanges hands once every 400 years in Ireland compared to every 70 years in France.
I was aware that the responsibility to be a good farmer and hand the farm on to the next generation in an improved state can be a challenge. Could I relish the challenge of being self-employed, loving farm life and being at one with nature? Would it be a dream career and an ideal lifestyle? I had a love for the land, yet would it become a millstone around my neck? Would I feel too tied down by it? Time would te

Highlight: Now in its third year, Connected has once more cast the net wide to find the 30 most interesting people under 30 in Irish tech. Emmet Ryan takes you through the change-makers 
Body


At three years I’m guessing we get to call this an institution. The 30 under 30 started because of the diversity of stories we saw in Connected and across coverage of technology. The biggest debate throughout has been what is a tech job.
Our solution has been pretty simple, we look at how and where the individuals involved use tech or influence it in some way and see if they fit the bill. This list isn’t about a single definition of success or importance. Instead, Connected’s goal is to introduce you to a breadth of young people who are having an impact on Irish society.
With that in mind, we don’t rank the list. Comparing Jake McGwire with Sinead Burke or Megan Sheridan with Paul Sheridan is just pointlessly putting numbers on a board. This list is about finding the 30 people (well 33, but we’ll get to that) who tell that broad story.
For some housekeeping, we consider co-founders as a single entry and there are three pairs here. Also, our definition of Irish tech is anyone based in Ireland or any Irish person based anywhere.
How we order the list is simple. Every name is written on to a piece of paper. Those pieces of paper get scrunched up and put into a pint glass. That pint glass then gets a good old shake and a name is drawn. The pint glass gets shook before every name is drawn, even when it’s down to just one because that’s how they do sports draws on TV, albeit without a pint glass.
With no further ado, here’s the list, with Twitter handles for every entry included, save one who doesn’t use Twitter so we included their Instagram.
Rhona Togher and Eimear O’Carroll
Ages: 27 and 27
Roles: Co-founders of Restored Hearing
Twitter: @rhonatogher and @eimearocarroll
Our first entry out of the pint glass of destiny is a duo making their third straight appearance on this list. Rhona Togher and Eimear O’Carroll are both from Sligo and, like a few other entries on this list, are veterans of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.
Having raised €15,000 on Kickstarter in 2017, Togher and O’Carroll developed Sound Bounce, an insert for a standard pair of earmuffs. The device responds to an increase or decrease in noise levels. This protects the wearer’s hearing from sudden loud noises while still allowing them to hear conversation when the noise levels are lower.
The duo, who are based out of the Cluster hub in Dublin, started on the idea while in school together in Sligo and developed it into a winning BTYSTE project. While they went to separate third-level colleges, they kept developing the business and have also developed a tinnitus-focused product called Sound Relief.
Previously based in Wayra, the move to Cluster gave Restored Hearing a different kind of working environment as it is a start-up hub run and owned by the start-ups there. It’s the type of space which is conducive to getting work done while also being among like-minded business people in the same boat.
Paul McDonnell
Age: 29
Role: Global head of product marketing for Intent Media
Twitter: @paulinternet
Following a brief stint in consultancy with Tata Consultancy in London, McDonnell co-built a few small start-ups in Dublin, like PopMeUp, a short-term property leasing company. In 2010, he took this knowledge of the start-up ecosystem and joined Web Summit as one of the first full-time employees.
In 2011, he became the Dublin 6 firm’s start-up director, creating a community of over 300,000 start-ups which led to more than 2,200 companies exhibiting at each conference. In this role he also expanded several of the teams at Web Summit and helped expand the company into London, Berlin, Lisbon, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, and Hong Kong.
His current role is with Intent Media, a data science start-up based in New York and London with $50 million in venture funding. He joined the company in 2015 to build its London office before moving to New York.
In addition to all this, he consults with several companies in the US, Britain and Ireland on growth, new market entrance and customer acquisition, as well as holding advisory board positions at Rutgers University and some early stage high-growth start-ups.
John and Patrick Collison
Ages: 27 and 29
Roles: Founders of Stripe
Twitter: @collision and @patrickc
You have probably heard of these lads. They are very successful.
They also are the easiest way to explain why we don’t rank the entries on this list as comparing them with a Sinéad Burke is just bonkers. Both have their own valuable and fascinating properties, but not a whole lot in common.
The Tipperary-born and Limerick-educated brothers are easily the most recognisable names here and, in case you didn’t know, Stripe is a mobile payment service that has received backing from a laundry list of big-named investors in the United States. They are successful and quite interesting, but there’s not a whole lot new worth adding in such a short entry, except that Patrick ages out of eligibility for next year.

A quick moment here to point out that Menno Axt’s Twitter handle is a four-digit number and for the life of this corner we have no idea why. Far more importantly, in his role at Dogpatch he helps corporates work with start-ups and develop internal start-ups.
Axt is the co-creator of the Alltech Accelerator, a global leading late-stage AgTech accelerator. During the first year of the accelerator, six out of ten start-ups were ranked in the CB Insights Top 100 Agtech start-ups.
Previously, he was a membership manager at Galvanize, a leading co-working space and tech learning community in the US where he was responsible for membership and entrepreneurial programming.
Axt, originally from the Netherlands, graduated from Colorado State University, with a degree in business administration and economics in 2015.
Valerie Heatley
Age: 26
Role: Founder of Salubrious
Twitter: @ValerieHeatley
Another repeat entry here, the story behind Valerie Heatley is rooted in her family. Aged eight, she and her sister sold jars of jam to hotels in Co Wicklow. Heatley officially started her career as a trainee recruitment consultant in Computer Futures.
After quickly identifying the niche, she established herself as the sole specialist in DevOps recruitment. This led to signing her first joint venture with DevOps start-up Speerhead Resourcing at 23, taking up the position as managing for Ireland.
From there she joined TriangleCS where she was brought in to build an automated high-volume sales and marketing platform, modernise end-user technology while creating the Triangle Enterprise Mobility message.
Since finishing up with Triangle, she has launched her online health and beauty business Salubrious, while also getting back to her roots in Wicklow helping her siblings get going with their own companies.
Conall Laverty
[caption id="attachment_417620" align="alignleft" width="131"] Conall Laverty, founder of Wia[/caption]
Age: 29
Role: Founder of Wia
Twitter: @conalllaverty
Few names popped up with the frequency of Conall Laverty during my research for this year’s list. He is filling what I like to call the Brian Martin role where, like the Blueface man who aged out this year, I flat out hadn’t realised until now that he was under 30 and needed to be told this by several people.
Laverty’s business, Wia, is a cloud platform for software developers building internet of things applications. Wia provides a simple way for people and things to talk to each other with just a few lines of code.
The platform is now being used by developers in more than 85 countries and has attracted €1 million in venture capital funding, with backers including Suir Valley Ventures, Enterprise Ireland and NDRC. Suffice to say, Laverty is a big deal in IoT in Ireland.
Previously he was chief technical officer of Big Motive, a creative technology company based in London and Belfast. There he architected and developed products for BBC, Net-a-Porter and Channel 4.
He was also technical director of Woogie, an innovation consultancy who has worked with Cambridge Silicon Radio, Deezer, and start-ups throughout Ireland. Before all that, he attained a first-class honours master’s from Queen’s University Belfast in computer games development.
Anna Krys
Age: 29
Role: Founder of Academy of Communications
Instagram: feelmytravel
The lone non-Twitter user on this list, hence providing her Instagram instead, Krys moved to Dublin in October 2015 from Odessa, Ukraine. A natural entrepreneur, she has run multiple businesses, led many community development initiatives and has worked in tech in Ukraine and Ireland.
From 2013 to 2017, she worked as business development manager in Opera Mediaworks — the world’s largest mobile advertising platform and the biggest brand-focused mobile advertising network in the world. Now she is developing her own education tech product — an online public-speaking platform and is working on community development projects in Co Kerry. Krys is also a journalist and is an active volunteer with the Alternatives to Violence Project doing education work in Irish prisons. She is also an Instagram influencer with over 9,500 followers, which is probably a sign that not everybody needs Twitter to get attention. Her articles are about useful mobile application during travels and life in Ireland.
Before moving to Dublin, she was the owner of a concert agency and co-founded two youth public organisations, Debate for Change and Debate Federation of Ukraine. Krys was also named ‘Philanthropist of year: Leader of Youth Movement’ in her native Ukraine in 2014 before coming to Ireland.
Paul Sheridan
Age: 19
Role: Founder of Reflex Gaming
Twitter: @PaulMXCI
For the second year straight, Sheridan is the youngest person on this list but at least he’s actually done his Leaving Cert now so Connected readers don’t feel quite as ancient reading about him.
In 2016, Sheridan founded Reflex Gaming, an online exchange and marketplace to compete for earn items on PC games. The idea grew out of a start-up weekend and that moved on to the Start-up Next programme, backed by TechStars. Having initially raised €20,000 via Growing Capital, Sheridan landed a €100,000 investment in 2016 from HostelWorld co-founder Ray Nolan. Customers on the Reflex Gaming site buy a virtual currency before competing with other players for more of that currency. From there, users can go to the firm’s online store to buy in-game items for popular games. Nolan has previously told this paper about how impressed he is by Sheridan’s progress and that’s not a bad endorsement to get.
Céline Heemskerk
[caption id="attachment_417619" align="alignright" width="131"] Céline Heemskerk, corporate communications at Indeed[/caption]
Age: 28
Role: Corporate communications at Indeed
Twitter: @clhheemskerk
When you have to put this list together as a 37-year-old grey-haired chap, you quickly feel rather overawed by the skills and achievements some of these people have. Heemskerk uses three languages daily in her job, as you do, English, Dutch, and Portuguese.
Having lived across three continents and five countries, Heemskerk has built up a wealth of experience at a young age. Her role with Indeed has her heavily involved in the HR tech firm’s moves into new markets while being based primarily in Dublin.
Heemskerk’s job involves managing relationships with multiple stakeholders on a daily basis across different countries, cultures, and seniority levels. That would be a challenge for most, but she makes it look like a breeze because, again, she’s done an awful lot of stuff in an awful lot of places in a short time.
Caroline Brady
Age: 25
Role: Marketing lead at Pointy
Twitter: @pointy
Prior to her current role at Pointy, Brady studied business and music at Maynooth University and also spent a year abroad at the University of Miami, Florida. After graduating with a BA International degree in 2015, she began working at Pointy and was their first female employee.
Brady started out in product integration and quality assurance managing a team of data specialists who ensure high quality and accurate data across the Pointy platform.
After this she played a key role in the initial launch of the Pointy app in Ireland which has been downloaded by over 30,000 people here. The launching of the app also marked her entry into the world of PR and public speaking as she secured coverage for Pointy in prominent news publications and was interviewed by various media outlets.
Since then Brady has represented Pointy at a number of trade shows and conferences in Ireland and overseas. She is also responsible for creating content for Pointy’s blog, newsletters, webinars, and social media. She is currently in the process of writing an ebook for brick and mortar retailers.
Greg O’Donoghue
Age: 28
Role: Director at Big & Bright
Twitter: @gregodonoghue
From vice-president of USI, to client-driven PR campaigns at Edelman, and now as co-director of talent management start-up Big and Bright in just two short years, Ashbourne native Greg O’Donoghue’s career is on the up. O’Donoghue, along with business partner Shane Gillen, set up Big and Bright in 2017 following the breakout success of their first client, Irish urban pop group Chasing Abbey.
Navigating the waters of a rapidly changing music industry, where downloads and streaming have overtaken traditional sales, as well as managing and creating digital strategies for an array of clients, means that it pays to have an edge and stay ahead when it comes to industry tech. With a background in accountancy and keen business instincts, O’Donoghue has a broad range of skills he brings to the company.
James Allen
Age: 26
Role: Global programme manager at Google
Twitter: @jpallen
Having graduated from Trinity College with a degree in business in 2014, Allen is currently a global programme manager on the international growth team at Google. His focus is on assisting some of the world’s fastest-growing businesses to expand internationally by helping them remove operational barriers in areas like localisation, cross-border payments and global customer care.
Allen is also the program manager for Google’s Adopt A Start-up initiative which matches Google expert mentors with scaling start-ups for a 12-week period. Over 140 high-potential Irish start-ups have participated since its launch in 2014 and a number have achieved significant success both domestically and internationally including familiar names such as Jobbio, FoodCloud, Beats Medical and Newswhip.
Cassie Delaney
Age: 28
Role: Director of content at Jobbio
Twitter: @cassielorraine
Since joining Jobbio in January 2017, Delaney has helped redesign and grow the company’s blog to over 150,000 unique readers. She has also helped develop partnerships with exclusive media outlets, resulting in Jobbio being able to reach more than 100 million professionals globally.
Delaney’s role involves steering the company in a unique content direction, which places workplace issues like the gender pay gap, diversity, and paternity at the centre of Jobbio’s campaigns. Earlier this year, the firm conducted original research on the salaries of senior tech professionals in Britain and the US which revealed the disparity in pay through its Shatter The Glass campaign and encouraged Jobbio customers to pledge to alleviate the gender pay gap.
Prior to working in Jobbio, Delaney spent two years in Her.ie, originally as a multimedia producer and quickly promoted to deputy editor. There, she helped the site develop initiatives like the Repeal hub, Her Say and Her Talks.
As Delaney clearly doesn’t like having any free time she is also the co-host of Lovin’ Dublin’s Before Brunch podcast which has amassed over 100,000 listeners in the past three months.
Daniel Kyne
Age: 20
Role: Start-up manager at Dublin Tech Summit
Twitter: @daniel_kyne
There are a few people on this list who are likely to hang around for an awfully long time before they become ineligible. Nobody’s guaranteed their spot, but certain youngsters just tend to reliably retain it because they remain fascinating to follow.
As one of Dublin Tech Summit’s first employees and the conference’s start-ups manager, Daniel Kyne helped to scale the event in its first year. Kyne is one of Ireland’s youngest Techstars community leaders and has been organising start-up weekend events around the country since mid-2015.
A founding member and adviser to the Digital Youth Council of Ireland and a member of the international advisory board to the Excited Digital Learning Movement, he has helped voice the opinion of young people from all over Ireland at a national level.
Sean McLoughlin
Age: 28
Role: YouTuber
Twitter: @jack_septic_eye
When this corner first covered McLoughlin in 2015, he had an awfully impressive 3.3 million subscribers on YouTube. By the time he made the list last year, that had risen to 15.6 million. At the time of going to print, he’s well on course to break the 20 million mark in the next couple of months.
That’s not bad for a lad who was originally just having some fun online, but McLoughlin has turned a hobby into something he treats with unwavering focus. His follower count is such that he has more subscribers than the next six largest Irish channels combined. He’s kind of a big deal.
Jayne Ronayne
[caption id="attachment_417615" align="alignleft" width="300"] Jayne Ronayne, founder of Talivest[/caption]
Age: 29
Role: Founder of Talivest
Twitter: @jaynesara20
The daughter of two entrepreneurs, Ronayne has already learned plenty about the need to not sit on her laurels while developing a business. The Cork woman’s business, originally KonnectAgain, had seen a couple of makeovers before she decided on a big change this year.
The rebrand to Talivest was done to reflect a change in direction for the business as a whole. Having raised $1.5 million since founding the company in 2013, the business has grown to include 25 staff with the bulk of those roles being added this year.
On top of her own work, Ronayne has proven a must-follow for her ability to communicate what it’s like to get a business going from the ground up in a clear and informative way.
Robbie Skuse
Age: 26
Role: Co-founder of Kollect
Twitter: @robbieskuse
Skuse’s company, Kollect, is a booking engine for on-demand waste collection based in Waterford. Founded in early 2016, the business now employs 16 full-time staff. Skuse co-founded Kollect with serial waste entrepreneur John O’Connor and John Hegarty. Kollect has three verticals: bin collection, junk removal and skip hire. Customers book waste collections through Kollect’s booking engine and Kollect then subcontract to their waste collection partners. The business will shortly launch in Britain, targeting Manchester first.
Skuse studied business information systems in UCC and went straight into start-ups after graduating. His first venture was an on-demand cleaning company which he closed down in mid-2016 to focus on Kollect. This year, Skuse finished third in the best-established category at Ireland’s Best Young Entrepreneur Competition.
Ross O’Dwyer and Richard Barrett
[caption id="attachment_417621" align="alignleft" width="300"] Ross O’Dwyer and Richard Barrett, co-founders of Pundit Arena[/caption]
Ages: 29 and 28
Roles: Co-founders of Pundit Arena
Twitter: @ross_odw and @theboybarrett
Our final combined entry on the list, O’Dwyer and Barrett once again make the grade after another big year for their Pundit Arena business. The second edition of the One-Zero conference, which they back, went by this past winter without a last-minute pull-out and was once again a big success.
Having started out with just a €5,000 grant through UCC’s Ignite programme, user-generated content site Pundit Arena has grown into significant force in English language markets.
Pundit Arena’s success with One-Zero is only part of the reason the duo retained their slot for the third straight year. The company continues to expand promisingly and grow its presence in international markets.
Pauline Kwasniak
[caption id="attachment_417618" align="alignright" width="148"] Pauline Kwasniak, founder of TurnedSee[/caption]
Age: 29
Role: Founder of TurnedSee
Twitter: @TheVenuePro
Originally from Poland, Kwasniak moved to Cashel, Co Tipperary, at 15 years old with her family and has been on a rather fascinating journey through business ever since. She holds a degree in European studies from IT Tallaght and University CEU Madrid. After completing a few internships and working with various events, she got involved heavily in the professional meetings and events industry.
She launched her own venue sourcing and groups hosting agency Hotel4meetings.com in 2015, and looked after some important brands and clients. In the meantime she travelled the world, invited by the biggest hotels brands and meetings industry shows. Her dream was always to launch a platform for event buyers and special event suppliers — connecting them to each other and allowing them to do business together. Her dream came true in 2018 — she launched TurnedSee with support from NDRC.
Edel Browne
Age: 21
Role: Co-founder of Free Feet Medical
Twitter: @edelbrownie
Another who has retained her spot on this list rather easily, Browne is a former winner of the BTYSTE who turned her winning project into a business with major implications for the health sector.
FreeFeet develops technology to help improve the quality of life for people with Parkinson’s disease by enabling them to adjust their gait easier. A graduate of the Outbox Incubator in London, Browne has also lectured at Cambridge about her work. Browne is still working on her undergraduate degree in NUI Galway, about to enter her fourth year there, and she’s got plenty keeping her busy.
Browne spoke at the Forbes 30 under 30 conference in Boston in 2016 and has been a Nissan Next Generation ambassador, a programme run by the car maker to aid young business people. All of this and she’s still rather busy with university life.
Jake McGwire
Age: 24
Role: Co-founder of Evopass
Twitter: @jakemcgwire
McGwire’s business Evopass is a face-value ticket exchange where fans can securely buy and sell tickets at face value. By working directly with artists, Evopass is trying to stop the outrageous ticket touting and fraud promoted by other sites.
Having moved over from London to Dublin for college, McGwire studied economics at Trinity.
Here he explored a number of start-up ideas, ultimately founding Evopass with Kevin Murray and Zach Diebold in 2016.
Evopass subsequently participated in the Trinity Launchbox programme and received investment from NDRC. With festival season fast approaching, Evopass is ramping up operations ahead of what the business expects to be a very busy summer.
Illann Power
Age: 26
Role: Entrepreneur and investor, founder of Illann Power Companies
Twitter: @illannpower
As the son of rock music legend Niall Power and Irish spirits industry veteran Michelle, innovation, entrepreneurship, and creativity have always been at the forefront of Illann Power’s career.
The New York-based Irish American entrepreneur and investor was a co-founding Partner at the American distilled spirits company, Incubrands. Among the top-shelf liquor brands created by the company was Angel’s Envy Bourbon, which was acquired by Bacardi in 2015 for over $200 million.
Following the acquisition and departure from Incubrands, he formed an investment company Illann Power Companies and has built a wide-ranging portfolio in aviation, hotels and hospitality companies such as Nyon Air and Blade, Virgin Hotels USA, Spotify and Bob Dylan’s newly launched Heaven’s Door Whiskey, along with a staple of seed-stage high-growth technology companies.
Declan Kelly
Age: 27
Role: Head of investors at Web Summit
Twitter: @deckelly
Kelly joined Web Summit in 2014 and is currently head of investors. This role has seen him build relationships with senior partners at every major venture capital and growth equity firm globally, plus the world’s leading angel investors, limited partners and sovereign wealth funds. Kelly and his team are responsible for managing the entire investor ecosystem across Web Summit events and connecting them with some of the most exciting and disruptive start-ups from across the world.
He also curates Venture, the world’s largest VC-focused conference held in both Lisbon and Hong Kong, and is a director of f.ounders, a gathering for 150 leading founders, chief executives and venture capitalists globally.
Megan Sheridan
Age: 28
Role: Manager of events at Intercom
Twitter: @meganlsheridan
Making her third straight appearance on the countdown, Sheridan has moved to San Francisco since the last list to aid with Intercom’s international growth. Taking a more theatrical style to what is conventionally expected from tech conferences and events, Sheridan has seen her role grow substantially within Dublin-based start-up Intercom.
Sheridan is the brains behind Intercom’s successful tours which have geeks from across the globe shelling out to hear the firm’s story and insight.
An IADT graduate, Sheridan’s life before Intercom was based around theatre production, design and helping creative businesses to become physical spaces and stores in Dublin. Having joined the firm as an assistant to the leaders and creators of the company, it wasn’t long before she was recognised for her creative and ambitious mindset.
Rich Forde
Age: 28
Role: Consultant at Beachhut PR
Twitter: @richardmforde
A graduate of UCC and Dublin City University, Forde founded his own start-up with DCU Ryan Academy, which he ran for many years before joining Web Summit.
At Web Summit, Forde was responsible for driving PR activities, strategy, content and media relations. He brokered commercial partnerships with global media outlets like the Washington Post, CNBC, Bloomberg, Fox News, Vogue and Forbes] which included the launch of the first-ever European Midas List.
An expert in the global technology landscape, he has worked with some of the largest tech companies, celebrities and influential start-ups across the globe working to boost their profile through coverage in high-profile international outlets, spanning web, print and TV and has dealt with some of the world’s leading tech and business journalists.
Now, a consultant with Beachhut PR, he leads on international PR managing clients such as Circle and Intercom.
Melanie Murphy
Age: 28
Role: YouTuber
Twitter: @melaniietweets
It’s been quite the year for Melanie Murphy. Her debut book, Fully Functioning Human (Almost), came out in the summer and she has subsequently produced and starred in a short film.
With almost 550,000 subscribers on YouTube, Murphy’s work has evolved considerably in recent years. Having started out with a heavy focus on beauty and confidence-based content, Murphy now creates videos around women’s issues and sexuality.
On top of her own channel, Murphy has also worked for Icon network and go90, both of which have significant backers.
The nature of her job, which has also seen a stint as a presenter for ITV Be, has seen Murphy hop back and forth between Ireland, Britain and the US while always building her audience and reaching new types of viewers.
Sinéad Burke
Age: 27
Role: Blogger/Activist
Twitter: @thesineadburke
When Burke made the list last year, there was a sniff that the following 12 months were going to be something special. The end result still blew everyone away as the disabled rights advocate and fashion expert has gone global including a highly publicised cover appearance on Business of Fashion.
Alongside amassing a social media army and changing the world from Dublin to Davos and everywhere else she can travel, Burke is also studying for a PhD. Her start came from developing her blog, Minnie Melange, in reaction to seeing that the fashion brands she admired weren’t making clothes suited to her 3ft 5in frame. That has grown into her becoming one of the go-to voices in Ireland on how to use digital channels to change society.
Mark O’Reilly
Age: 28
Role: Founder of FitVision
Twitter: @fitvisiondublin
O’Reilly is a classic case of a person with little in the way of technical background operating in a sector not immediately classed as IT who has seen ways to use it to make a difference for him.
O’Reilly is keeping the tech sector in Ireland fit, putting together the health and wellness programmes for Primark and Facebook and many other top tech companies in demand, an area where he has carved a particular niche as corporate health and wellness becomes more of a necessity for large companies rather than a novelty reserved for tech giants.
He helps clients take ownership of their fitness with a specially designed health and wellness app, marrying technology that has an ability to make tracking positive lifestyle changes convenient and easy, as well as the old-school touch of knowledgeable, intelligent personal trainers.
An accomplished triathlete, O’Reilly completed his first ironman triathlon in 2014 along with helping clients at the time, Niall Breslin and Rozanna Purcell, both finish their first ironmans. He subsequently qualified for the World Championships that same year in only his second ironman event. In short, he’s really fit and is quite smart about using technology to help others also get really fit.
Adam Harris
Age: 23
Role: Founder of AsIAm
Twitter: @adampharris
There’s a trend of activism to this year’s list, quite apt considering the movements we have seen from Ireland’s youth, and Harris is no exception.
Harris campaigns for disability rights along with working as a social entrepreneur. Harris is leading the fight against pseudo-science with AsIAm, an online resource for the autism community in Ireland. Harris provides clear information that is backed by medical science to empower the autism community.
AsIAm is a user-led initiative that develops projects and campaigns built by and for the autism community, providing a platform that gives a voice to the community and enables people to share their stories.
Patrick Lynch
Age: 27
Role: Chief executive of First Circle
Twitter: @ptbjl
The nature of the pint glass of destiny is that someone has to be last, but Lynch certainly isn’t least on this list. First Circle, which is held by Carabao Capital, is an Irish firm targeting the Philippines and South East Asian markets by using technology to make financing faster in the region. Lynch is formerly of Morgan Stanley and he co-founded the business which is trying to apply IT solutions to essentially open up the market.
The business uses data analytics heavily to enable quick access for clients in a region where accessing finance is an awkward and laborious process. Lynch is heading up the Irish business which is looking to make a mark in fertile and, financially speaking, relatively uncharted territory.

The Labour Party now faces its greatest challenge
Sunday Business Post

Length: 835 words
Byline: Pat Rabbitte
Highlight: The liberal agenda has been realised: it’s time to take on the issues that preoccupy this generation of young workers 
Body


No political party has a better claim to having been midwife to modern Ireland than the Labour Party. In 1983 when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil surrendered to the fundamentalists in the Pro-Life movement, Labour opposed the insertion in our Constitution of the Eighth Amendment.
It took a Labour minister, Barry Desmond, to dismantle Charles Haughey’s “Irish solution to an Irish problem” and bring access to artificial contraception into the 20th century. This was further refurbished by Brendan Howlin when he was minister for health.
When in 1990, Mary Robinson – a young progressive woman lawyer with a record of achievement – agreed to contest the presidency, she was nominated by the Labour Party. Labour in government with Fianna Fáil stipulated that homosexuality be decriminalised and the legislation was admirably piloted through the Oireachtas by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.
A narrowly successful referendum on divorce was led by a Labour minister, Mervyn Taylor, in the Rainbow Government of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left. It was the Labour leader and tánaiste Eamon Gilmore who persuaded the Fine Gael/Labour government to hold the Marriage Equality Referendum.
Labour is the only party that consistently from 1983 onwards has campaigned for the repeal of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Shortly before voting in the 2011 general election the Irish Independent emblazoned David Quinn’s piece with the headline, ‘A vote for Labour is a vote for abortion’.
Between 1983 and 2018 other, more minor achievements on the social agenda were chalked up along the way. Of course, Labour wasn’t entirely on its own. Some civil society and women’s groups, some campaigning journalists and some political alliances along the way put their shoulders to the wheel.
However, being known to sponsor the so-called liberal agenda was usually a lonely outpost. How many young women today know that Spuc (the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children) threatened Ivana Bacik with imprisonment when she led the campaign for the provision of information relating to abortion services outside the jurisdiction?
The election of Mary Robinson as President was transformative. When the Workers Party joined Labour in nominating her, the late Séamus Brennan forecast a flight of capital if she were to be successful. Pádraig Flynn questioned her credentials as a mother and a campaign emerged questioning whether “the Left is Right for the Park”. The past is indeed a foreign country.
However, the past is more recent in Ireland than we sometimes think. As recently as the noughties, the then taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, accused the deputy leader of the Labour Party, Liz McManus, of being “a member of a pro-abortion party”.
Usually among the most courteous of parliamentarians, Ahern made the jibe because he believed it would adversely resonate with middle Ireland.
To make matters worse, although widely broadcast as spoken, the Dáil record claims that Ahern charged that McManus was guilty of “being a member of a pro-choice party”. When I protested over a period, I was eventually informed by the Ceann Comhairle that the Official Dáil Reports are not Hansard. In other words, they are not a verbatim record and occasionally the spoken word is “tidied up”.
Watching the scenes of joyous relief at Dublin Castle last Saturday, very few, I suspect, wanted to dwell on the past. Indefatigable campaigner and former Supreme Court Judge (and former secretary to the Labour Party) Catherine McGuinness was one who sought to put Friday’s momentous development in historical perspective. However, apart from a perfunctory acknowledgement of the Trojan work of Senator Bacik, there was no evidence that anyone wanted to seek out the opinions of today’s Labour Party.
The Labour Party is now facing its biggest challenge in its 100 years of existence. The so-called liberal agenda is over. After last weekend, outstanding issues are by comparison routine. There is no electoral dividend from the liberal agenda and, bizarrely, there is no penalty for the parties that obstructed its delivery for decades. These are rights that the people of modern Ireland take for granted. Fianna Fáil is correct: the party will not suffer in the general election because of its stance for the old Ireland. In the argot of the day, Simon Harris is “a legend”, and rightly so, but he has the maturity to know that it won’t last.
Today’s Labour Party must get stuck into the issues that preoccupy this generation of young workers: affordable accommodation and extortionate rents; precarious employment and zero-hours contracts; the paucity of occupational pensions cover; and the comfort of an accessible functioning health service.
It is time for the younger faces – Ó Riordáin, Sherlock, Nash and others – to man up. The task cannot be left to Alan Kelly and Ivana Bacik alone.
Social democracy will renew itself across Europe and, in Ireland, Labour remains the standard bearer for mainstream European social democracy. The challenge was never greater.

The private sector has been sidelined on pensions policy
Sunday Business Post
June 2, 2018

Length: 935 words
Byline: Brian Keegan
Highlight: In recent years, pensions 'reform' has involved proposals to remove tax reliefs for pensions savers without any underlying systemic reform
Body


According to some news headlines last week, Italy is in chaos because of its political impasse. Elections held there over two months ago have yet to result in a government being formed. There may well be political chaos, but I spent some time in Italy last month. Day-to-day life didn’t seem to me to be any more chaotic than usual.
Politicians and those who comment on them are capable of overestimating their impact on the people and institutions which they govern. Our own country didn’t fall over back in 2016 for want of a government for several months after the inconclusive election results. In Europe it is becoming increasingly commonplace for countries to cheerfully survive months without an established government.
However, where there is political indecision or instability, institutions can come up with politically deaf notions. A report by a Dublin City University professor some weeks ago suggested that British MEPs would not have to leave the European Parliament post-Brexit, because they were, in some sense, still representative of the European population as a whole. That finding was met with some suspicion by the political system.
Our man in DCU may well have been right in his reading of the way European law works. Pragmatically though, there will be no room for politicians from Britain in the European Parliament after March 29, 2019. Their influence is already in decline.
Similarly, the European debates on tax, notably the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposals, miss the realpolitik of the foisting of Europe-wide rules on national governments. Brian Hayes MEP has been especially strong on this point to any European officials or Commission members who will listen to him. No finance minister can come back to their national governments to explain that their country is going to lose €1 billion or more in tax collected because of change to a new EU system,
When there are some political holes that simply cannot be filled, democratic controls curtail the poorer policy ideas that governmental institutions can bring to the fore.
Any policy reform must be both politically and technically feasible. There is a much quoted observation, apocryphally ascribed to the late Dr Garret FitzGerald, that some proposals may be all very well in practice but also have to work in theory. Usually the risks are all the greater should theoretical desirability trump the practical application of a new policy.
Take for example the setting up of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group as reported by Michael Brennan in this newspaper last week. It is made up of officials from a range of government departments. There are no private sector representatives among its membership. Shouldn’t there be someone with life experience of private sector pension funding contributing to any such think-tank?
Remember what happened the last time policy makers turned their attention to private sector pension funds. A levy of 0.6 per cent of the capital value of private sector pension funds – note private sector only – was applied to unsuspecting pensions savers. That levy was unjust. It was a wealth tax levied on one cohort of our society simply because it was possible, not because it was right. In normal circumstances the political system might have headed this injustice off at the pass. Tax policies from 2011 were not created in normal times, and the levy has since been abolished.
In recent years, pensions “reform” has involved proposals to remove tax reliefs for pensions savers without any underlying systemic reform, which is an odd approach for a nation where 65 per cent of private sector workers have made no provision of their own for retirement.
The government’s latest pensions roadmap says this is “despite the availability of generous pensions reliefs”, without apparently considering that maybe 35 per cent of private sector workers can afford to make contributions to schemes only because of the availability of said “generous” pensions relief.
Nor is there anything particularly “generous” about a relief that reduces future demand for state services while collecting tax on future pensions payments. Pensions tax relief is only generous when it is compared to the other few tax reliefs available to workers. Pensions tax relief only seems generous if you don’t have to rely on it for a secure retirement because you have a state funded pension.
Promises to introduce mandatory private sector pension funding, with an option to opt out, have been made for decades. According to the government pensions roadmap, mandatory pensions funding in the private sector might not be a reality until 2022 at the earliest. This is a bizarre delay for a strategy which is favoured by trade unionists and employers alike.
The current government could well be heading into its last few months. The confidence and supply arrangement keeping the Taoiseach and cabinet in place only extends to the next budget. In such a climate ideas emerging from the likes of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform & Taxation Group might not receive the kind of political scrutiny they should.
We need our political system to knock poor ideas from our governmental institutions on the head. Pensions policy has a poor track record. Tax relief for private sector pension funding is one of the last tax reliefs available to individuals which carries a social benefit. If it is to be curtailed or eliminated, we need our politicians to be asking who benefits from increasing the tax burden on the private sector.

The secret start-up

Highlight: This week, a young entrepreneur opens up about how a battle with alcohol almost derailed his entire career
Body


The struggle was real
As the last few parts of this story have outlined, as the years progressed, my struggle with alcohol became real.
I think I recognised a potential issue with alcohol early on, and when I was about 24, a year or so into my start-up adventure, I made an effort to go without it. I had a girlfriend at the time who was not happy with my choice. Suffice to say I lasted about a month. And it was in that time that she decided to cut ties with me. No craic can sometimes have a price.
Most of the great stories that I have from my life begin with the line: “I had a huge hangover.” It’s sad but true.
It’s also quite remarkable that it was when hungover that I would often come up with my best ideas, or achieve something great. The very creation of my start-up idea came from a hangover. You can produce greatness when at your most desperate. I don’t recommend it, however.
I was the definition of a binge drinker. One was never enough. Two certainly weren’t. Whenever I went out saying “I’m only going to have a couple,” once I had that second drink, something clicked in my brain that would just say: this is how it’s going to be for the evening.
I started experiencing blackouts early on, but they became increasingly common as time went on. When I would wake the next morning, I’d immediately become panicked as I attempted to recall the previous night’s adventures and misadventures. I’d wonder who I had to apologise to for going too far with my impassioned verbiage. I would end up apologising to people just in case I had said stupid things. Often I hadn’t done anything wrong, but as I didn’t know one way or the other, I felt it was best to apologise anyway, just in case.
“You were fine,” they’d respond. “You were just your usual self.” Whatever that meant.
Stupid behaviour due to alcohol contributed to the downfall of more than one significant relationship, and the damage that ensued from those break-ups only led me to drink more. You dig yourself a hole, but it’s never quite deep enough. Trying to get out of that hole became the real struggle.
Alcohol abuse has been significant in my family. One of my grandfathers died aged 49 from it. He swallowed his tongue, I learned. I don’t think drinking helped my father either. He died aged 49 too. A big ideas man, he would say in his last years that alcohol helped level him off when his head ran away with him. Although some might not consider Dad to have been an alcoholic, with a couple of bottles of red wine a night, you might say he was.
When I moved to the US six years ago, it seemed people were positively boring compared to me. Americans talk themselves up as a fun bunch, but in truth they have two or three drinks and that constitutes a mad one. They didn’t know how to do it, I thought.
The truth is that the Irish are considered a nation of drunks by many Americans. “Oh, you’re Irish. It’s okay,” they would say after I had made a fool of myself. You wear your Irishness as a badge of honour for a bit. We are the fun people. We are the people that know how to have the craic. We pride ourselves on it, and I certainly didn’t want to let people down. I always felt the pressure to be the life and soul of the party. I always took on the responsibility of getting the conversation flowing.
When people visited New York, they loved meeting me for a few drinks. Now and again, that is. The Irishman: always a reliable drinking buddy, always available for a good night out. But while this was an odd night out for them, this was three or four times a week for me, the skipped days being devoted to recovery.
My hangovers became darker and darker. I literally wouldn’t be able to get out of bed. I wouldn’t be able to leave my room. I would be ordering Grubhub three times a day. Ordering anything that might cure the pain I was enduring. I never found a combination that really did the trick.
Working with a hangover became an impossibility. The number of lost days I couldn’t count. When I did manage to make it into the office, I would count the minutes till I could leave, such was the internal terror. And those minutes passed slowly. I often thought I was going to die. I would wonder if anyone else noticed how bad I was. I look back at photos of myself at that time and I see someone bloated and messy in appearance.
When things were bad (and they usually were), they were very bad. After receiving our big investment I decided to go to one of the world’s biggest conferences in Cannes. Wandering home, and in the mood for a nightcap, I spotted a strip club. “What the hell,” I thought as I ventured into the fine establishment. My next memory was of the door reopening with the morning light glaring in my eyes. It was about 7am. I decided that going to bed was pointless at that time, and so after breakfast I headed straight back to the conference. I rambled the floor and talked to anyone who would listen about how amazing my business was. Come midday, I was ready for bed.
I awoke the next day with one of those heavy heads. The fright kicked in as I remembered the strip club. I thought about the missing hours. I quickly assessed what I might have lost. Losing bank cards, keys and passports was a common thing for me. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a receipt. €640. I couldn’t believe it. How had I managed to spend €640? I reached in again, another €640 receipt. And again. And again. And again. I began to shake. What’s worse, I could see I had decided to use the new company card.
I had to phone our new company bank manager - a woman named Rachel, in the US, from a big start-up bank. I had no option but to tell her my humiliating story: the story of the drunk Irishman who had wandered into a Cannes strip club, and blown a chunk of the new investment.
For the record, I think the strip club knew I was drunk, and just swiped and swiped and swiped my card until eventually it got blocked.
When you are in a dark space with alcohol, you think about people you could confide in. There are not many. People don’t get it. People do not know what to say.
“Ah, you’re not bad. You’re grand.”
That’s why alcoholism becomes a lonely struggle. So many times, when you complain that you’re dying with a hangover, the response you get is: “Ah, sure have another one. Hair of the dog. It’s the only way.”
Not that I would ever be brave enough to end it all. I don’t think so, anyway. But when clouded by darkness, your mind wanders. When surrounded by nothing but pain and misery, and with no exit route, you consider the options.
My personal battle with the booze had many twists and turns. I made various efforts to kick it. I managed to get a couple of months under my belt before a damaging relationship fully collapsed. That seemed like a pretty good reason to start up again.
You think after such a break that you might be able to handle it. You think wrong. I was back with a vengeance.
In AA (which I have gone to on occasion and recommend to anyone who has similar struggles), others speak about hitting their ‘rock bottom’. They speak of hitting their lowest point. What’s amazing is how low you can go.
Ten years down the road with my company, which was now under the ownership of one of the world’s biggest multinationals, I was going through the motions like never before. There was simply nowhere I could take it. The owners had no ambition for it either. They wouldn’t even let me try to take it to a new ownership. I was trapped.
I had made a big effort to not drink with people from the office. I would become too open-mouthed around them after a few drinks. I would often talk a big game about how I would reorganise the company.
It was a Monday evening and I met a friend in New York for a couple of drinks. Like a true alcoholic, I identified who I would meet up with once that friend would go home. And so I went to another bar to meet another friend. Coincidentally, it was the bar next to our company office. To my surprise, a number of the junior staffers were sitting around. Perfect. They would be my next chums on the night out.
To make sure they stuck around, I bought the group a round of shots. I would often do that for people when I sensed they might be about to leave.
Once my second friend left, I joined the group. I started talking about our overlords. Somewhat tongue in cheek, I suggested we launch a corporate take over from within. I told the group that the company didn’t care about us. They just stared at me. They were not on my wavelength. To my surprise, they were all happy with their jobs. They didn’t share my discontent.
Once they left for home, I wandered into the New York night. I found another bar, where I went till last orders. In NY that’s 4am.
The next morning there was no chance I was going into work. No big deal. Nobody ever made a comment about my occasional tardiness. I scrambled for my laptop so I could tell one of my colleagues that I was working from home. In my inbox there was an email from the second in command at the company. This was the person I liked least among the overlords. She never emailed me, so I had a fear when I saw her name.
“It’s 10.30. Where are you? The office opens at 9.30. You are late. You were obviously out last night bad mouthing all your work colleagues. I’m sick of your attitude. Change it, or find a new job.”
Although she didn’t fire me in that moment, I felt as good as. I felt embarrassed. I felt humiliated. I had finally done it. I had finally managed to bring about my own downfall. To be honest, it was a miracle I had not done it before. I always felt I was skating on ice, and I would eventually get found out.
What must have happened is one of the group I was blabbering to must have gone straight in the next morning and essentially told on me. Not cool. But what could I say? ‘Loose lips sink ships’ is what a wise Dubliner once told me. ‘You have to know your audience’ is what my father once told me.
I had no excuses. I emailed back impulsively.
“I am sorry. I have no excuses. I hold my hands up.”
But I knew I had to regain some control over the situation. So I added:
“Having said that, while my discontent should not have got out this way, clearly I am not happy with many things at the company.”
I requested a week off to think about the situation. She responded granting me the time to think it over.
With that I headed out to buy a packet of cigarettes and began chain smoking in panic. I was convinced it was the end for me. I couldn’t imagine walking back into the office. I was mortified. I called a range of friends and told them what had happened.
That was the day I decided it really was it for me and the booze. I was so depressed I knew it had to be it if I was going to survive the situation. I needed clarity of mind. But I made a mental decision that day, that I would need to adopt a total different approach to kicking alcohol than I had done in the past.
I decided that I had to spin the whole situation into the ultimate positive. Quitting alcohol for good would have to be the the best decision I ever made. I couldn’t let it hang around my neck like a burden. To steal a line from from an 80s song, I decided to CHOOSE LIFE.
That weekend I looked to the future. I needed a pet project. I began writing a book about my father. In the weeks and months that followed, I decided to re-embrace the passions of my youth. I began playing football again. Once I did, I felt shame for having neglected something that gave me so much joy. I decided to start learning how to play the piano. I signed up to do a half-marathon. I decided to start going to the movies regularly again. I decided to start going to concerts. I decided I wouldn’t say no to things. I decided I would still go out. I wouldn’t avoid bars. I decided to move into an apartment of my dreams. Each week I focused on making small tweaks to my lifestyle. I was scrubbing it up.
Oh and if you’re wondering what I did about my company drama, I pulled a Larry David. I actually went back in the next day. I didn’t wait a week. I just went back in, put my head down, and got on with it like nothing had happened.
The next few months were the best of my life. The months leading up to the day I was laid off. And by the time that happened, I was mentally prepared to deal with it. It turns out that life is much less phasing with the benefit of a clear head, a clear mindframe.
Do I miss drinking now? I don’t. Will I ever drink again? I never like to say no. All I do is live for today. It might sound like a clichéd mantra, but it works for me.
And so we come towards the end of this tale. Next week we will wrap it all up, and try make some sense out of it all - if there is any sense to be made out if it.

The value gap: How northside trumps southside

Highlight: A flat sold in Ballymun was almost three times better value for money per square metre than one sold in Dublin 4 
Body


Latest auction results show a wide variation in value for money between apartments in different parts of Dublin, when valued on the basis of price per square metre.
For instance, a Dublin 4 flat sold for double the price of one in Ballymun but, when valued on the basis of floor area, the value for money offered by Ballymun was actually almost three times better than the southside flat.
Although the Dublin 4 flat at only €355,000 was relatively modestly priced by recent local standards, such price differences are part of the reason why more apartments are being built in Dublin 4.
Located at 6 Lansdowne Lodge, Haddington Road, it extends to 54 square metres, which equates to €6,574 per square metre. I-Am Sold’s Leinster auction was the agent on the two-bedroom apartment.
Some days later on May 30, a two-bedroom flat - 162 The Plaza, Ballymun, Dublin 9 - sold for €170,000 at an REA Dempsey Sothern auction. It extends to 74 square metres, equating to less than €2,300 per square metre or almost one-third the Haddington Road unit.
Ironically, a neighbouring smaller Ballymun apartment, 163 The Plaza, which also sold for €170,000 at the REA auction, achieved the equivalent of €2,763 per square metre as it extends to 61.52 square metres. This suggests a value for money difference between the neighbours of more than 20 per cent. Both two-bedroom Plaza units are tenanted and located on the top floor of the building.
BidX1’s auctions last week also showed contrasting value-for-money prices for Dublin flats. For example, a Cabinteely apartment sold for 12 per cent per square metre more than a two-bedroom unit in the IFSC.
11 Brennanstown Court, Cabinteely, Dublin 18, sold for €236,000 or the equivalent of €5,364 per square metre. Extending to 44 square metres, the vacant one-bedroom apartment is located on the first floor.
The IFSC two-bedroom unit, known as 214 Tusker Rock, Dublin 1, sold for €345,000 or almost €4,792 per square metre. It extends to 72 square metres on the sixth floor.
In a nearby location, between the IFSC and Gardiner Street, a larger unit appeared even better value as it sold for €4,118 per square metre. The 85 square metre 37 The Atrium, Block D, The Steelworks, Foley Street, Dublin 1, sold for €350,000 after 44 bids. A seventh-floor, two-bedroom unit, it generates €1,250 in monthly rent, suggesting a gross yield of less than 4.3 per cent.
Further west between the busy shopping precincts of Parnell Street, Mary Street and Capel Street, a two-bedroom duplex, Apartment 8 at 25 Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin 1, sold for €287,000 after 20 bids. That equates to €4,783 per square metre for the vacant 60 square metre unit.
One of the highest prices per square metre was achieved by a 47 square metre Temple Bar apartment which sold for the equivalent of €6,596 per square metre. Located at 67 Music Hall, Cows Lane, Dublin 2, this fifth-floor unit had the advantage of two bedrooms and a city centre location and sold for €310,000.
The most valuable lot at BidX1’s auction last Thursday was an investment portfolio of five houses at 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 Aisling Court, Lehenaghmore, Togher, in Cork city which sold for €880,000.
It comprised three four-bedroom and two three-bedroom semi-detached houses ranging in size from 82 to 103 square metres. Four of the houses are tenanted and generating €40,080 in annual rent.
Back in Dublin, a mid-terrace, two-storey Victorian house at 64 Grosvenor Square in Rathmines, sold for €855,000 after its guide price had been reduced from €800,000 to €750,000. It extends to 157 square metres and had accommodated seven flats, but it requires refurbishment throughout.
A derelict detached house, Sillan Lodge, on Church Lane, Greystones, Co Wicklow, sold for €460,000 after 55 bids. It sits on a 0.192-acre site.
At REA Dempsey Sothern’s Leinster auction on Wednesday, (May 30), 12 lots sold for a combined €1,342,500. They included a commercial investment at Unit 1, The Park Business Centre, Cabinteely, Dublin 18, which achieved €197,000 or €37,000 more than its AMV. It is let to Park Academy crèche at €16,000 a year.
At its Munster and Connacht auction on 29 May, Limerick auctioneer REA O’Connor Murphy sold 17 lots with combined values of €1,698,500. One of the best prices was seen for an end-of-terrace, three-bedroom house, 53 Ballyhooley Road, on the south western side of Cork City which sold for €127,000 or €28,000 over its reserve.
REA’s recent online auction sold 17 regional residential properties from all four provinces and generated €1,124,900 in sales. The most valuable of its lots was a two bedroom ground floor apartment of almost 79 square metres at 3 Blackrock Mews, Eden Convent Road, Blackrock, Cork City, which sold for its €195,000 AMV.
I-Am Sold’s Leinster auction on 17 May saw an end-of-terrace house at 108 Beaumont Road, Whitehall, Dublin 9, laid out in five apartments and located next to a service station, sell for €600,000 or €5,000 over its starting bid.

Time for a deep breath to consider the state of the EU

Highlight: As the Italian debacle has shown, Brussels should stop interfering in EU member states’ political affairs and concentrate on improving what works
Body


‘When in Rome, do as the Romans do” is a well-used counsel to observe the local tradition or to defer to those with practical experience. Last week, it took on a slightly different meaning. It is a counsel against heavy-handed foreign intervention in the political affairs of the Italians.
Günther Oettinger, the EU’s commissioner for budget and human resources, found himself at the centre of a slightly contrived controversy when he made some remarks in a Deutsche Welle interview to the effect that he hoped Italian voters would learn to avoid handing power to populists of right or left when the economic and market consequences of doing so became clear to them.
Those sentiments were abbreviated, distorted and decried in short order – leading to a semi-apology from Oettinger, a thinly-veiled reprimand from Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, and a distancing statement from Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president.
Even though his sentiments were seized upon unfairly, Oettinger had made manifest a common condition in the corridors of Brussels, the willingness to make insensitive and condescending remarks about the outcome of elections held in member states of the EU.
Either we accept that the people in each member state are masters in their own houses as regards the way in which they vote or we do not. Finger-wagging at the Austrians, the Hungarians, the Czechs, the Poles and the Italians because of how they choose to be governed is simply not the job of un-elected EU commissioners. They are, after all, the servants of a union of sovereign member states whose policies are decided on by their respective electorates.
Emmanuel Macron, right on cue, waded in too. He supported Sergio Mattarella, the Italian president, in his bid to appoint an unelected technocrat and former IMF official, Carlo Cottarelli, as prime minister in place of Giuseppe Conte, the nominee of the Five Star/Liga coalition, which holds a majority in the Italian parliament.
Macron was not only meddling in an arrogant way; he misunderstood the situation completely.
Mattarella was believed by the great majority of Italians to be abusing his office. He was seen as thwarting democracy. His caretaker nominee, Cottarelli, hadn’t a chance.
The likely result of refusing power to the Conte government would have been another election and an even greater parliamentary majority for the would-be coalition. Such an outcome would have severely weakened the EU and put an end forever to Macron’s integrationist plans for a sovereign, federal Europe.
Italians were outraged by the actions of their president. The hapless Cottarelli came under a blizzard of rejection and condemnation. He handed back his invitation to form an un-elected government. President Mattarella was left utterly isolated and widely reviled.
Mattarella was handed a fig-leaf to cover his inevitable climb-down; the Five Star/Liga coalition partners agreed to shift their proposed finance minister, Paolo Savona, over to be the Italians’ minister for European affairs, and to give the finance portfolio to Giovanni Tria, an economist who has in the past called for a re-think of the euro rather than a rejection of it.
And so the Conte government will take office. The coalition is one which is regarded with a good degree of scepticism and not a little horror in Brussels and Paris.
Undoubtedly, the EU establishment is secretly hoping that Conte’s government will collapse in mutual recriminations under the weight of unfulfilled election promises and hopes, on the one hand, and the cold and uncooperative disapproval of the EU institutions on the other.
One of the new government’s priorities is the issue of immigration. Italy has decided collectively to reject the utterly ineffectual EU approach to immigration and migration. Angela Merkel’s policies, as operated through Brussels, have simply alienated vast swathes of public opinion throughout the EU.
The voters in member states simply do not trust the EU on the migration issue. The very idea that Germany should open its doors to one million migrants and invite them to filter through the territories of other member states was absurd. Likewise, the demand that the consequential increase in migration should be shared out compulsorily among the member states was bound to produce the reaction that we witnessed across Europe – not least the rise of the far-right AfD in Merkel’s own backyard.
The Italians bore the brunt of the EU’s failure to address the migration issue firmly and competently. And the nasty rise in racist politics that we have seen in Italy was as predictable as it was unwelcome.
It may well be that Conte’s Five Star/Liga coalition will go the way of so many Italian governments. We only have to remember the antics of Matteo Renzi’s administration to appreciate how accident-prone Italian politicians can be. It seems such a short time since I was predicting in this column that Renzi was on course to implode.
He tried to distract the poor Italian voters with promises that he was about to bring about a United States of Europe. He arranged a childish photo-call with Merkel and Hollande on an aircraft carrier off the island of Ventotene to re-dedicate the EU to the federalist ambitions embodied in the so-called Ventotene Declaration. A much-reduced Merkel is the only remnant of that political triptych.
While Italian nerves may be temporarily soothed, and while Macron will now devote his hyperactive attention to dealing with the protectionist trade tariff war being waged by his “ best buddy of last year”, Donald Trump, we would all be well advised to take a deep breath and consider the state of the EU.
It is a tragedy that Britain is leaving the EU. The Brexit process may yet surprise us all. There may well emerge a new arrangement for the North, Some form of EU/Britain customs partnership may still come to pass. A lengthy transition period for Brexit may yet become semi-permanent.
Events in Madrid demonstrate the fluidity of European politics. Who would you prefer to be now – Rajoy or Puigdemont?
Macron may well see himself as the answer to the many and disparate problems of Europe – but that is a minority point of view. The EU is not some giant blank canvas on which to paint some French impressionist imagination of neo-Napoleonic ambitions. It is a successful partnership of distinctive democracies and that is what it can and should remain.
The Brussels establishment would be well advised to tone down the rhetoric and to concentrate on improving what works in the EU, rather than plotting for things that don’t work and won’t work.

Trade union expects Lloyds Pharmacy workers to vote for industrial action

Highlight: Around 200 Lloyds Pharmacy workers from over 50 stores across the Republic of Ireland are voting in the Mandate ballot on whether they want to take industrial action
Body


Lloyds Pharmacy workers are expected to go on strike in the coming weeks over what the Mandate trade union claims is the company’s refusal to engage with it.
Around 200 Lloyds Pharmacy workers from over 50 stores across the Republic of Ireland are voting in the Mandate ballot on whether they want to take industrial action.
Gerry Light, Mandate assistant general secretary, said the ballot will run until Wednesday but, as it is a bank holiday weekend, there is only one day left to vote.
“The turnouts thus far have been very high,” he said.
If the ballot passes, it is likely that strikes will begin very quickly, possibly as early as Thursday, June 14.
“Even though it is a secret ballot, you do get a sense when people are at ballot meetings. They are quick to offer an opinion.
“While we cannot be certain, it looks like the members are very determined for the matters to be dealt with,” Light said.
The pharmacy group has been embroiled in a dispute with Mandate since the trade union lodged a claim on behalf of its members in February 2017, which covered a range of conditions of employment, including a pay increase, the introduction of incremental pay scales across grades, improvements in annual leave entitlements and public holiday premiums, greater security of working hours (eliminating zero-hour contracts) and the introduction of a sick pay scheme.
In a statement, Lloyds Pharmacy, which employs 1,000 people in Ireland, said it engages directly with an employee representative committee through the Colleague Representative Committee (CRC).
“Last month, our employee representative committee successfully negotiated and balloted on a comprehensive framework agreement, with a majority of our colleagues voting in favour of it.
“This agreement will provide enhanced terms and conditions for all our colleagues.
“It includes both pay increases and the reintroduction of a sick pay scheme. We are pleased to confirm that the terms of this agreement will take effect from this month, with these terms currently being implemented.”
However, Mandate claims that Lloyds Pharmacy set up the CRC in a “cynical ploy” so it could claim that the trade union was not the sole representative body.

When I was learning to play poker behind the bicycle shed, I was told that you shouldn’t split a decent pair in a hand you’ve been dealt. There’s always a chance you might improve on it. But for some curious reason and to its detriment, the second season of Stefanie Preissner’s creation Can’t Cope, Won’t Cope (RTÉ Two) split the pair of Mallow mates who had lent much of its dynamic. Aisling (Seána Kerslake) remained in Ireland, while Danielle (Nika McGuigan) took herself off to Canada.
You might think that after the first season, which had developed into something of a morality tale, the fabulously, frenetically feckless Aisling – who is fantastically good at her job when she has one – might have learned all that could be learned from endless nights in Coppers and a brush with the law. But season two saw her as unaware and heedless as ever.
Preissner introduces new characters into Aisling’s life. One is Joe (Peter Campion), a slow-talking, philosophising Dub who’s hoping she’ll reach some state of contentment by going to the gym – physical activity being something of a cult, in the minds of its devotees promising eternal life. Mostly, however, she’d rather go with him to The George.
Aisling shares an apartment with Joe and with her landlord, Lorraine (Sheila Moylette), last seen in Aisling’s previous workplace forever bouncing on a large rubber ball at her desk. Not bouncing one, bouncing on one. But then, that was an office that could put up for a remarkably long time with Aisling.
Here, Lorraine is behaving even more strangely, portion-controlling her week’s food, taking a different route to work each day, and switching off her mobile phone to avoid being stalked. Oh, and she disappears and reappears in an instant. What was all that about, other than trying to inject some quirky originality into what was beginning to look increasingly like a boozy Dublin version of Groundhog Day?
And then there are the coincidences, more in this series than in the first. In her new job, Aisling and her boss Ryan (Lochlann Ó Mearáin) seem about to embark on an affair, but his adult daughter tells him her engagement is off because Aisling has had sex with her fiancé who’s an old flame (Aisling had indeed gone to his apartment for an uncomplicated, though unconsummated, quickie). And Aisling’s little sister Rachel (Hannah Sheehan) has got pregnant by Keith (Patrick Ball), the sex pest from Aisling’s office. In a world shrunk to little more than Coppers, The George and some office space in the Docklands, sure anything can happen to anyone.
There was also the brief return as deus ex machina of Kate (Amy Huberman) to a senior position in Aisling’s office in the penultimate episode, just in time to fire her in the finale.
Where does Can’t Cope, Won’t Cope go from here? A third season, probably. But Danielle’s return from Vancouver, when eventually it did happen, really didn’t do much to lift a rather limp second outing which was carried, by and large, by Seána Kerslake’s performance. Must try harder.
RTÉ has been in love with architects ever since it discovered Dermot Bannon and this continues with The Great House Revival (RTÉ One).
Architect Hugh Wallace of Home of the Year (RTÉ One) a show that smacks so much of showing off I blush for it, has so far taken viewers on four 19th-century restorations. In the first three of these shows, the restorers were architects, who did much of the work, donkey and otherwise, so helping to reduce the budget which, in the case of the first two restorations seemed impossibly small.
But the restoration of a Donegal cottage was not embarked upon by a person with such training and skills, but by Irene McDermott, a nurse working in England, who had inherited the thatched cottage of which she had many happy childhood memories.
Wallace, with his habit of rubbing his hands together, in this rural setting looked more than ever like a parish priest, coming perhaps to discuss the stations with the woman of the house.
He waxed lyrical about vernacular architecture and form following function, but worried about the relative gloom of a building with such small windows, went up on a roof with a thatcher to discuss his craft, and visited a couple of other restored cottages to see how these buildings could be made habitable in the modern world without, say, covering the thatch with solar panels.
The restoration seemed to take a very long time for so small a building; local festivals and the odd storm can, apparently, get in the way of speedy work in Donegal. The cottage, now complete with electricity, a fancy stone stove, running water, a bathroom and its small windows restored, eventually cost McDermott €107,000.
RTÉ’s love of architects continued with one for whom light, space, form and function were paramount. Talking to My Father (RTÉ One) featured Simon Walker, the son of Robin Walker who was a major exponent of modernist architecture in Ireland from the 1950s through the 1970s after which he left the practice of Scott Tallon Walker, giving up architecture for writing.
Walker, born in Waterford, studied in UCD, worked with Michael Scott on Busáras then left to study with Le Corbusier and work alongside Mies van der Rohe in Chicago. He returned to Ireland full of zeal for the functionality and space of what became known as Miesian architecture.
This was not always embraced with popular enthusiasm and, aside from the newly refurbished and renamed Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street (designed by Walker’s colleague Ronnie Tallon) is now something of an endangered species. Walker’s 1961 building nearer to Baggot Street Bridge, the former Bord Fáilte HQ, was recently threatened with demolition.
Simon Walker, himself an architect, made the aesthetic case for his late father’s buildings, from a private house overlooking the harbour at Kinsale, to the early 1970s restaurant building at Belfield for UCD, the buildings for Wesley College in Ballinteer and the Baggot Street building.
Both Belfield and Wesley have made changes to Walker’s original concepts.
A troubled Limerick-born film star whose life was more nightmare than fairytale was the subject of Brian Reddin’s Constance Smith: Tragóid Hollywood (TG4).
Smith, who died in 2003 on an Islington street, grew up in considerable poverty in Mount Pleasant Buildings in Ranelagh – author Lee Dunne said he knew her when she worked in a local chipper – but won a look-alike contest as Hedy Lamarr and got a contract with the Rank Organisation.
She married English actor and film director Bryan Forbes and, having been dropped by Rank, emigrated with him to Hollywood for a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. When she became pregnant, the studio forced her to have an abortion and her marriage to Forbes ended.
Smith was never in the top rank of 1950s Hollywood, and her life and career spiralled downwards, through historical potboilers in Italy, two more marriages and a violent relationship with the equally alcoholic British film director Paul Rotha, more than 20 years her senior, whom she stabbed on two occasions, both of which landed her in prison. In later life, she survived by cleaning floors.
At one of her trials, her defence lawyer declared hers was “a story of a poor and beautiful girl who was squeezed into a situation of sophistication and fame when emotionally quite unable to cope with it”. She had no desire to become an actress at all, he said.

Tyrrelstown property firm Vieira loses €2m Vat case

Body


A property company that was caught up in a storm over proposed mass evictions on a west Dublin estate two years ago has lost a €2 million Vat case.
The High Court has ruled that Vieira Limited entered a “purely artificial” licensing arrangement to sell 198 houses in Tyrrelstown with the principal aim of obtaining a tax advantage.
Vieira was set up by Richard and Michael Larkin to develop a very large and dense housing estate in the area between 2001 and 2009.
Properties were rented out during the downturn. The Larkins hit the news in 2016 when tenants in the Cruise Park area began receiving quit notices from their homes, after a Goldman Sachs vulture fund bought from Ulster Bank an €89 million loan that the company had secured on the Tyrrelstown estate.
Last year, a tax dispute between the developer and the Revenue Commissioners was referred to the High Court.
Having cleared a Vat liability of around €4.4 million from a licensing agreement for 198 houses under what the Larkins said was a “self supply” arrangement with the selling agents, Vieira disputed a further Vat assessment of €1.94 million for the actual sale of the properties.
The selling agent was McPeake Auctioneers. The court heard that the phased development at Tyrrelstown involved 35 different house types, which caused problems when it came to building showhouses for prospective buyers to view.
It was argued that the difficulty became more acute in the second phase of development, when building regulation changes meant the showhouse complex was no longer representative of the houses coming on stream.
McPeake said many customers were first time-buyers and some did not have English as their first language, which meant that misunderstandings about alterations being made to the properties could arise.
The court heard in 2003, to get around the problem and facilitate quick sales, McPeake was granted a 14-day licence by Vieira to take possession of individual housing units for viewing purposes.
However, analysing the licensing arrangement under tax law, High Court Justice Caroline Costello concluded that the arrangement was contrived. She said it “could not plausibly be suggested that 198 showhouses were required”across the estate.
In her view, the principal aim of the arrangement was to obtain a tax advantage. She added that Vieira had not established any other legitimate business objectives underpinning the deal.

Upping the Ante: Burke the sole ray of light on a rainy night in Paris

Body


Part of the motivation behind this column was to educate people who may look on gambling on horses, or on sports generally, in a negative light.
That the suggestions are mainly long-term bets may be more consistent with an investor’s mindset; it also ensures that it is more likely that the advised price at the time of typing will be extant on the Sunday morning as you read this. Nowadays, odds tumble in five minutes, so this column needs to embrace a patient outlook. Just as in stocks, or even in Aldi, the price is everything.
If one had followed this column’s advice every week since its inception, one would have nearly trebled his or her investment so far. That also accounts for last week’s Guineas winner Alpha Centauri not being available at the advised 33/1 last Sunday morning, but at a best-quote 22/1.
In giving betting tips, a general guide is to aspire towards a return on investment of around 10 per cent. As such, readers who are new to Upping the Ante must be warned. Here, it seems prudent to quote Nana in The Royle Family as she enjoyed an intimate moment with her granddaughter shortly before her wedding: “This is the best day of your life, Denise: it’s all downhill from here.”
Last Monday probably amounted to the best day of Graham Burke’s young life, which has been less than straightforward. A precocious and extremely talented footballer, he cannot have had it as easy growing up as he makes the beautiful game look. Graham ‘Choco’ Byrne, his father, has links to gangland figure Gerry Hutch and was the subject of an assassination attempt earlier this year.
Burke, who has taken his mother’s surname, is a product of the famed Belvedere academy, from which he joined Aston Villa seven years ago. He was first called up to a matchday squad for Villa in the third round of the League Cup in September 2011. He was the joint-top scorer in the 2012-13 NextGen Series under-19 club tournament, scoring both of Villa’s goals in the final, which they won.
On July 1, 2013, Burke and Mikey Drennan from Co Kilkenny both signed new two-year contracts. Little did Burke and Drennan – who later quit professional football due to issues with depression, but who is eyeing a return – realise then that they would both end up at Shamrock Rovers.
Playing in Ireland has long been a barrier to recognition, but Ireland manager Martin O’Neill saw Burke score in Tallaght recently in a 3-0 win over champions Cork City (he scored another screamer, this time with his weaker foot), was impressed, and gave him ample game-time against France six days ago. His debut of sorts came earlier against Celtic, but that was a testimonial for Scott Brown; Paris was much closer to the real deal.
Burke’s first effective involvement was to play a finely judged ball into space for a teammate to run on to. That it amounted, perhaps, to Ireland’s best pass on the night compliments the Rovers man, while emphasising the abject poverty of football we have become accustomed to under O’Neill.
It may have seemed much ado about nothing but, given that Burke is not unaccustomed to playing in front of a few hundred people in his homeland, boasting such composure and self-belief moments after coming off the bench at the Stade de France speaks volumes about how far the 25-year-old has come. His inclination to look for the ball consistently probably surprised his new teammates, repressed as they are by this much-heralded coaching team’s defeatist agenda.
France, however, were on another planet and so superior to Ireland as to render the eventual 2-0 scoreline grossly misleading. With the outrageously talented Paris St-Germain striker Kylian Mbappé set to take the tournament by storm, and their qualification out of Group C seemingly a formality, Didier Deschamps’s side may take some stopping in Russia later this month.
They can be backed at 7/1, even 15/2 in a place. With the sole exception of Brazil in 1958, no non-European team has won a tournament hosted on this continent, rendering the prevailing odds for the South American sides less appealing.

Victims of a growing economic divide

Highlight: The landslide vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment was delivered by a mobilised youth.  But this very generation, authors of such radical  social change, are the victims of a growing economic divide between young and old
Body


The landslide ballot to repeal the Eighth Amendment was delivered by a mobilised youth, in particular women aged 18-35. They are impatient to reshape the country in their own image. In a sense they are righting a wrong. Almost no rich country has a greater mismatch between its law and its predicted degree of liberalism, based on demography alone, than Ireland.
However, the generation that impacted such radical social change are the victims of a growing economic divide between young and old.
These activists face a health system in crisis, an education system in need of wholesale reform, a housing system seemingly set up to indenture them, and a pension system that, frankly, it would be charitable to call a timebomb.
Even though Ireland was a poorer and darker place back then, their parents, in the 1980s and 1990s could afford the trappings of a middle class lifestyle – a house, a car, a holiday – on a median income. Today’s young people – and, as we’ll see, they aren’t actually that young – face a completely different set of circumstances. If they have access to a pool of savings, then perhaps they can live ten post codes away from where they’d like to. Accessing childcare and educational choice for their kids is an uphill battle. Their work is likely to be less secure than their parents’, with fewer pensionable benefits.
Let’s not be doomsayers. Ireland in 2018 is a far better place to be a woman than Ireland in 1968, or even in 1998. This is the most educated generation of Irish people we’ve ever produced. It has access to more information than any generation before it. These people are more cultured, and have travelled far further, than their grandparents could have dreamed. Many of them have had to. Wages in Ireland are rising once more.
This generation is armed with the latest technology, the latest ideas and crucially, it has access to political power, and very soon it will have access to economic power. Even with the 2008 crisis happening while these people were in school and college, they still begin with a myriad of advantages in one of the world’s richest countries.
They’ve shown they can change the system when it comes to reproductive rights. Will they do the same thing for healthcare, education or housing?
I see last week’s result as the coming to power of the millennial generation. It’s wrong, however, to discuss it in purely demographic terms. It’s not like there’s a huge swathe of under-represented, angry youth out there. The chart on the right shows the proportion of people in the population aged 20 to 35 from 1960 to today. We have about the same number of people in this group today as we had in 1974.
Regardless of the relative size of their cohort, the millennials have changed the terms of the debate. The key change is a social licence, and a platform, to speak publicly about authentic experiences, where no licence or platform existed before.
This generation has built those platforms. It has been able to do so because other social licences have been at least partly rescinded. The Catholic Church is no longer a cultural, or political, monolith. The gradual removal of its hegemonic presence from schools and healthcare facilities is now openly contemplated by ministers for education and health. What replaces it in terms of ownership, governance and accountability is quite another matter. But it is a matter for another day.
The repeal campaign showed us that this generation of women (and men) are not “lost”; they are not “fucked”. They are engaged and willing to change the systems they inhabit. The question is: how?
The data show that the millennial generation faces a different set of problems to its predecessor, Generation X (which is my generation). Now, in your best Downton Abbey dowager countess voice, ask: “What is a millennial?”
A millennial is commonly understood as a person born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s, someone who came of age with the advent of the 21st century. Those at the front end of the millennial generation, those born in the early-to-mid-1980s, are now squarely in their 30s.
They aren’t that young. They’ll work until they are in their late 60s or early 70s. A millennial born in 1983 has, at most, 30 to 35 years of earning left in them, and they probably don’t want to work that long. They may already have several children. Their ability to accrue the kinds of assets their parents were able to is far lower, on average.
To repeat, it’s not all bad by any means. Unlike millennials across much of the developed world, Ireland’s millennials can still find secure, pensionable work in many fields. This is not true internationally. For example, in Australia, the majority of workers now face unsecured working conditions, with the loss of social supports and pension entitlements that kind of work implies. Australian wages are also stagnant, despite a growing economy. Union density in Australia is below 9 per cent in the private sector. This is true for many of the countries Ireland compares itself to.
In Ireland, where union density in the private sector is in the mid-20s and falling, wages are growing once more, though not enough to keep pace with productivity growth, let alone house price growth, as we’ll see.
Seriously, folks, join a union. A new paper by Princeton’s Henry Faber and colleagues has produced data on union density and income inequality from 1936 to today. Faber showed that when unions are resourced to do their work – negotiating for workers – income inequality was lower and a strong wage premium existed for unionised workers.
One way for the millennial generation to exercise power over its fate as workers is to re-endow the concept of unionisation with an updated legitimacy and relevance for a 21st-century economy that will thrive through growth in services.
Let’s bring it back to houses for a moment. We know population matters a lot when it comes to housing.
Despite the OECD recently warning Ireland about new mortgage growth, the main driver of property prices in 2018 is not bank credit, but a population that grew by an average of 35,000 a year from 2009 to 2017. Cumulatively, there are half a million more people in the country since house-building effectively stopped a decade ago, and 300,000 more since 2009.
The government is going to increase its capital spending by 23.5 per cent this year to try to cope with this shortfall, but even spending €6.7 billion in 2018 won’t make a dent in the problem between now and 2020.
It’s a density problem. Across the EU, there are 487 dwellings per 1,000 citizens. In Ireland, that number is 425. Our still-recovering banks are a large part of the problem. Ireland already has the OECD’s third-highest housing cost burden for mortgage holders, and the most expensive mortgages.
The increase in demographic pressure, combined with a collapse in capital investment over a decade, is also why our health system is constantly in crisis.
To get a sense of where we are right now, we have to look back a bit. Imagine a horse race. There are three horses. The first horse is called House Prices. The second horse is called Income. The third horse is called Debt. We’re going to measure the length of the horse race in percentage increases over time. These three nags define the shape of our economic opportunities as a country.
Start the race in the year 1995, and run it to 2015. At the start of the race, all three are level. Now move the race forward one decade to 2005. Income, that nag, has run to just over 150 per cent higher than its 1995 level. House Prices, the charger, has run to over 350 per cent higher than 1995. And Debt, horse number three, being ridden by AP McCoy, is romping home at 550 per cent. From 2005 to 2015, all three horses fall back.
Debt reduces as households get rid of as much of it as they can. Older households are more affected by this than younger households, but by 2015, the debt level has come significantly down. Income falls back even further, before recovering with the economy’s recovery post-austerity.
And as for House Prices? Median gross incomes for those holding mortgage debt are significantly higher in Ireland, when compared with the rest of the eurozone. Worse, long-maturity loans – those over 30 years – jumped from 10 per cent of all mortgages to 35 per cent between 2004 and 2007. It’s a safe bet to say our millennials won’t be getting long-dated tracker mortgages any time soon.
Looking at affordability in an international context, the National Competitiveness Council produced an excellent report in 2017 relating the number of salaries you’d need to buy a new 70 square metre dwelling, and the living standard of the country as measured by the value of output per person in that country. In general, the higher the level of development of the economy, the cheaper housing is.
This is 2016 data, and so Ireland’s GDP statistic is probably a bit dodgy, meaning we’re probably a bit lower down in reality. Regardless, you need over five years’ worth of a salary to buy anything, and with 2018 data I would imagine Ireland is moving towards Britain’s position. In Belgium, you need only 3.2 years’ gross salary to get a house.
In south County Dublin, you now need north of €80,000 in savings to put a down payment on a property. In Dublin city centre, it is €50,000. It is much lower elsewhere, but the substantial savings challenge remains, regardless of where you want to live.
We all know affordability is related to the price of the house you’re trying to buy and your income. The OECD computes standardised price-rent and price-income ratios that show the current price-income ratios relative to their respective long-term averages.
The long-term average, which is used as a reference value, is calculated over the whole period available, in this case 1980. Any number above 100 means prices are ahead of incomes and above their long-term average. I show the eurozone for comparison, and include the last quarter available. We can see that Ireland’s price-income ratio is climbing above its long-run level in 2017 and, with supply restricted, this will climb in the coming years.
This price-income trend deeply advantages older households, and disadvantages millennials. It is also the source of the ever-present Nimbyism which squats over every aspect of Irish life like a middle-aged lumbago patient with a stitch.
Anything that affects this long-run relationship is going to help millennials. Two policies will help most: increasing their incomes, either by collective bargaining or by the simple supply and demand of the labour market, and stabilising prices. Linking rental prices to the rate of inflation, and increasing the provision of social housing, creating truly mixed-use developments, is important.
Notice that the key changes I’m describing here aren’t economic. They are policy changes, regulation changes, cultural changes. This is the generation to make those changes. I’m sure of it.

Virgin Media Business has just announced the launch of its new mobile service targeted at small businesses.
Businesses can choose from a range of bundles that suit their particular requirements, with contracts that range from 30 days to 12 months, an online self-administration portal or dedicated customer service representative and current Virgin Media customers can avail of discounts also.
Bundles start from €25 with three varying options to choose from, with Voom Mobile International offering unlimited 4G Data, calls and texts in Ireland along with unlimited calls and texts to Europe, Canada and the US, and 10GB of data while roaming in the EU.
“This new mobile offering from Virgin Media Business is targeted at the likes of tradesmen, retailers, techies and the ‘small office/home office’ workers out there because, we know, for them, business is always personal and there is very little separation between their work and personal lives,” said Aidan D’Arcy, head of business division at Virgin Media Business.
“Because of the size and nature of their business, we’ve seen how other networks don’t bother communicating directly to them, ignoring them in favour of the bigger corporate accounts and/or offering generic services that are not tailored to their business. It’s no wonder, therefore, that many small business owners remain on personal plans.
“Every business deserves the best business services. Now with Virgin Media Business Mobile, we have plans to suit every business.
“We’re particularly interested in helping support Ireland’s up-and-coming businesses and want Virgin Media Business Mobile to become known as the business service provider for small businesses in Ireland.”

Warped values and stolen children

Highlight: Argentina has its version of stolen children: the infants of murdered women and political prisoners, given for adoption to supporters of the regime. Could it help us resolve our history of falsified birth certs and illegal adoptions? 
Body


The news last week linked in my memory the dark histories of Ireland and Argentina. It brought back a memory I can never forget. I was standing in a hidden corner of a small city cemetery in the Recoleta area of Buenos Aires at the excavation of a mass grave. The forensic anthropologists were uncovering the skeletons of some of the women murdered by the Argentinian junta during its dirty war in the 1960s and 1970s.
As the remains were carefully placed in empty fruit boxes (ironically bearing the inscription A Product of Argentina), a small bullet hole was visible in every skull. It was possible to see how each murder was arrived at with deadly and clinical exactitude, each forehead pierced in almost the same spot.
These tragic women - mostly young university students - were among the thousands of victims as the police and army ‘disappeared’ the regime’s political opponents. The ‘disappearance tactic’ where people were mostly snatched off the streets by plain-clothes security forces, tortured, killed and their bodies secretly disposed of, was invented to conceal this monstrous policy.
Like most of Latin America’s junta killers of the period, in countries such as Brazil, Uruguay and Chile, they had been trained by the US Army at the now infamous College of the Americas military academy in Georgia. Here they were trained in all of the dark arts, including torture and ‘disappearance’.
Apart from their left-wing views, the other crime of the unfortunate women being exhumed in that Recoleta cemetery was that they were pregnant. This posed a huge dilemma for the junta’s generals, self-styled upholders of good Christian values. In their moral conflation, while the unborn children were innocent, their mothers were not. So what to do with them?
The regime’s solution was to imprison the pregnant women and then execute them immediately after their babies were born. To further conceal this operation from wider public knowledge, the babies were secretly adopted by senior police and military personnel.
The children were to be told that their adopted parents were their real parents. But the grandmothers of the stolen children have campaigned ever since, across nearly 40 years, to recover their grandchildren and learn of the fate of their murdered daughters.
The world now knows them as the abuelas of the Plaza de Mayo - grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo. They began their extraordinary campaign by simply protesting always at the same time, on the same day and for about 15 minutes only, every week in the Argentine capital’s most famous location. Plaza de Mayo is the location of the presidential palace the Casa Rosada, which is famous, among other things, as the location of the Evita musical.
Back then, in 1977, the grandmothers simply wrote their murdered children’s names on white handkerchiefs and wore them on their heads as they slowly circled the square. So much for the regime’s attempts to secretly disappear its enemies.
Down the years, the grandmothers were threatened, attacked, arrested. But their unbreakable love and sense of loss for their murdered children and lost grandchildren sustained them. Slowly but surely they became the story Argentina could not silence nor ignore. It was not a story the world could ignore either.
In 1991, I made a Thames Television documentary telling the story of Argentina’s stolen children. It was at the beginning of the emergence of DNA technology and the programme offered the grandmothers’ organisation, for the first time, access to genetic fingerprinting as an aid to identifying the stolen children. Alec Jeffreys, who had discovered the process, was hugely helpful to us.
It is estimated that the grandmothers, thanks in part to DNA, have recovered and identified about 10 per cent of the stolen children. The recovery process is, as you can imagine, an encyclopedia of extraordinary personal stories. Every so often, a now middle-aged person will contact the grandmothers’ organisation asking a life-changing question. Others have been located from military archives, including some CIA files in the US.
Last week, back home in Ireland, we heard of serious doubts about the accuracy of Ireland’s 70,000 adoption records. It is perhaps helpful to know that the illegal adoption of children has been widespread in the world for years. Ireland is not unique in this child identity crisis. In fact, the Irish mother and baby homes and orphanages were typical of attitudes to children in many countries over a long period of time.
Britain probably illegally adopted and exported a greater percentage of its children - without their parents’ consent, and including huge numbers of orphans - than anywhere else. It is estimated that some 150,000 children in the years since World War I and up to the early 1970s were exported to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and various African countries.
The children were recruited by religious institutions from both the Anglican and Catholic churches, and the principal exporting organisers were charities such as Barnardos and the Fairbridge Society.
Their motivation, apparently, was to give “lost” children a new life, but there’s no denying that a racial element was also a factor, as the former British colonies and territories were actively seeking white migration.
In Australia, many of the children suffered abuse and neglect in remote military-like camps and the implications of that controversy continue to this day.
There was little public concern about these practices. The British royal family were both founders of and were actively involved with the Fairbridge Society. Today, hundreds of these exported children are returning to Britain, seeking their identities and their relatives.
The Irish child diaspora is little different, as arising from a variety of cruel and mistaken practices there are who knows how many unknown victims, children still seeking their parents and identity, as well as mothers seeking the children they lost.
We have all have heard these stories or met people still searching. One friend of mine has spent years trying to trace his mother beyond the little hotel near Paddington station in London, where she spent a single night. She was just off the Holyhead train, heavily pregnant with him and presumably en route to a secret mother and baby home. She disappeared subsequently after his birth, and what meagre records exist are no help.
Would it not be an idea if, like the Argentinian grandmothers who set up a genetic database specifically for identification purposes, we look at doing something similar here? In the Irish context, children seeking their mothers and relatives, and mothers seeking their children, could both voluntarily donate their DNA for potential of matching.
As those who run the Irish baby homes and orphanages die, and files disappear or were deliberately altered, as seems to be the case, the prospect of DNA matching would provide both permanent and undeniable evidence of family connections. There are adopted Irish children throughout Ireland’s global diaspora to this day, asking questions about their origins.
For unknown numbers, the heartbreaking search could end with a DNA match. At least it offers the real prospect of a resolution. Familial DNA finger-printing can reach for answers beyond the grave.
Like stories awaiting an end, the DNA samples from those skulls in Buenos Aires remain stored in the genetic database. Some have led to long lost children being recovered, the rest wait for a final act of justice. Like Argentina, we had our own stolen children.

The new legal services watchdog wrote to Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan late last year expressing “grave concern” that departmental interference was eroding the regulator’s independence.
Newly released correspondence between the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA) and the department shows tensions arose over the regulator’s perceived failure to deliver “early and visible” legal reforms.
While the LSRA opened for business in October 2016, following a legislative shake-up of the legal system, the regulator remains in start-up mode. The authority is far from being fully operational and is currently reliant on recoupable government funding. The most fundamental reform, the introduction of an independent system to handle complaints against solicitors and barristers, will not be up and running until the spring of next year.
Last December, the department warned the oversight body that it had missed the statutory deadline for introducing legal partnerships and that this could “potentially be seen as frustrating the will of the Oireachtas”.
Legal partnerships, which allow solicitors and barristers go into business together, are viewed by government as part of a suite of reforms that will help to reduce costs and remove outdated restrictions in the legal services market.
However, the department’s recommendation for a January target on partnership reform “drew a very strong reaction” from LSRA members, according to its chairman Don Thornhill.
Writing to Flanagan, he said it would be “impossible to continue to operate as an independent regulatory authority where the timetable for the progressive implementation of the Legal Service Regulation Act was being externally determined”.
He also expressed “surprise” that the Attorney General’s recommendations to the department on the introduction of legal partnerships conflicted with advice received by the LSRA.
The authority held to the view that legal partnerships could not begin to practise in the market without a new robust regulatory structure and a tailored insurance product.
Flanagan last year expressed the belief that the 2015 legislation, establishing the authority, provided a ready-made framework for partnerships. Independent consultant Tom Boland, a former civil servant and ex-chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, was hired by the authority to deliver a commencement schedule for the new body.
According to a recently released strategic plan, the LSRA will be ready to deliver legal partnerships this autumn.

Web Summit chief executive Paddy Cosgrave is seeking to raise $50 million for a new venture capital fund. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US, the fund will be called the Amaranthine Fund I LP.
The fund is registered in Delaware but based in San Franscisco.
The general partners in the fund are listed as David Kelly, a co-founder of Web Summit, and Patrick Murphy. Cosgrave is not listed as a general partner but he is involved in the new venture.
Patrick Murphy previously founded and ran Universal Music’s venture fund and he also worked as a technology investment banker with Goldman Sachs.
A website for Amaranthine disclosed little about its plans. It states simply: “We connect, support and invest in the world’s top technologists through the f.ounders platform.”
The fund is also thought to be intended to link the current generation of successful technology founders with the next one.
The word Amaranthine has various meanings, but its logo indicates that it is named after a mythical flower that never fades.
Companies that have attended Web Summit are estimated to have raised $50 billion and every year it attracts some of the world’s most successful founders and investors.
Last week, Web Summit said it planned to hire 50 more people, mainly in Dublin, and said it was introducing a scheme to help employees struggling with the cost of accommodation in Dublin.
Web Summit spin-out MoneyConf, which has moved from Madrid to Dublin, is due to take place at the RDS in two weeks’ time with speakers including Joe Lubin, the co-founder of blockchain start-up ConsenSys, which is creating 60 jobs in Dublin.
A spokesperson for Web Summit declined to comment when contacted about the new venture capital fund.

Highlight: Rather than dole out inspirational quotes or advice on breathing exercises, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett instead explain the impact of inequality on an individual level: on the way we feel, think and act
Body


Sociology: The Inner Level, By Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, Allen Lane, €23
The rise and fall of the Ugg boot – that staple of noughties fashion – is not a tale you might expect to find in a serious analysis of inequality. But the changing fortunes of sheepskin footwear are cited in this new book by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett as an instance of what others have sniffingly termed “prole drift”, or the devaluing of once desirable products as they find favour with the hoi polloi. While the decline of the Ugg is hardly cause for any grave concern, it speaks to a common impulse to maintain boundaries and status distinctions, according to their argument.
Living in a hierarchical, consumerist society, of course, we compare ourselves to others on the basis of everything from income and intelligence to attractiveness and, yes, even shoes on occasion. British academics Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett consider the effect of this relentless competitiveness in their latest joint study, The Inner Level, which, they stress, is not a self-help guide.
Rather than dole out inspirational quotes or advice on breathing exercises, the two epidemiologists instead explain the impact of inequality on an individual level: on the way we feel, think and act. As gaps between income increase, they contend, so does the destructive inclination to judge people on scales of best to worst.
The Inner Level follows up on the findings of The Spirit Level, a much-discussed 2009 study in which Wilkinson and Pickett connected rising inequality to a raft of social problems. This wellbeing-focused sequel turns to our psychological lives, arguing that both rich and poor suffer in the race for status under post-industrial capitalism.
Social anxiety is not merely a modern phenomenon, the authors point out. But while it has evolutionary origins, anxiety is objectively worsened, they say, by class divisions manifested not only in what we earn, but also what we eat, read, wear, drive, own. The significance of symbolic acts of refinement, like going to the theatre or presenting a tasteful home for dinner parties, is only heightened as societies become more socially stratified. Interestingly, inequality can also lead to greater narcissism, apparently to mask insecurities. For others, alcohol and drugs are the preferred props.
The Inner Level goes beyond vast swathes of the booming wellness industry by putting forward a radical vision for a better future. By redistributing income, class and power, Wilkinson and Pickett assert, we can forge a society that no longer generates such compulsive feelings of self-doubt.
Workplace democracy is a crucial component of the manifesto presented here. The focus of companies on shareholder profit, the book explains, for example, contributes to the lack of control felt by so many workers, which in turn increases stress and the likelihood of poor health.
There are non-economic causes of depression, of course, but the evidence suggests that meaningful improvements in our quality of life can go a long way towards alleviating stress and anxiety. It is fallacy, the book argues, for Thatcherite politicians to preach a gospel of classlessness, promoting social cohesion, while also dismissing calls to reduce income gaps as “the politics of envy”.
To support their case, the authors have produced charts linking income disparity to measurements as diverse as civic participation, child wellbeing and bullying. Their use of scatter graphs with generated straight lines running through points of data is a weakness of the book, though, sometimes suggesting unconvincing evidence of causation by connecting points that appear to be randomly dispersed rather than neatly supportive of an ideological framework.
But Wilkinson and Pickett do emphasise that the graphs published come from reputable sources, and that their own analyses have also been peer-reviewed. “Although readers will see that there are differences in the countries studied, the years for which data are reported and the measures used,” they write, “the most remarkable feature of this variation is that the overall picture we see is so consistent.”
Taken as a whole, the force of their evidence makes for a bracing and important read. We are hurt by existing economic structures and the insecurities they breed, and it’s both rare and welcome to find an analysis of mental health that takes this kind of damage into account. The conclusion here is straightforward: it feels better to be equal.

With the 182 reg rolling out, VW is so far top of the 2018 sales league

Body


Last Friday, the new car registration figures for May were released in full and they make interesting reading with the 182 registration in operation since that day. The overall picture is relatively unchanged, with 4.32 per cent fewer registrations so far this year in comparison to the same period in 2017. On the face of it, that doesn’t paint a rosy picture, especially as it seems the economy is booming in other quarters, but I reckon it’s far from disastrous, especially given the continued influx of imports from Britain and worries about the impact of Brexit on our future, not to mention all the uncertainty in the market surrounding the future of diesel power.
On that last score, there’s a clear reduction in demand for new diesel cars from the public. For the year-to-date, diesel registrations are down a massive 19.4 per cent on 2017, meaning a market share of 55.58 per cent (versus 65.97 per cent this time last year).
Petrol power, unsurprisingly, has taken up most of the slack, giving it a 37.95 per cent share against 30.27 per cent this time last year.
We need to be careful when assessing the importance of percentages, though, as electric car registrations have jumped 38.38 per cent and plugin hybrid electric vehicles a whopping 169.93 per cent, but those figures only represent 142 and 260 extra cars respectively in a market where 85,933 registrations have been recorded.
I don’t think we’ll have a clear picture of what’s happening until after the 191 period next January (and that could be affected by whatever the government does in the October budget, of course), though I believe we will see the diesel share drop another 10 per cent, which to me, makes sense, as, regardless of health worries about pollution from older diesels, more people are driving diesel than should be. Diesel power is completely unsuited to urban living or households that drive low annual mileages, even if they do carry out a few longer journeys a year.
In terms of most popular brands and models, Volkswagen tops the table for 2018 so far, with 9,345 cars registered. It’s ahead of Toyota, Hyundai, Ford, Nissan, Skoda, Kia, Renault and Peugeot, with Audi the only premium brand in the top-ten. The big winner in that lot is Peugeot, which has seen registrations jump a massive 53.58 per cent in the past year, thanks mostly to its new 3008 and 5008 crossovers.
And it’s crossovers that continue to top the best-selling models list, too. The evergreen Nissan Qashqai has overtaken the Hyundai Tucson for the number one spot, ahead of the Volkswagen Golf, Ford Focus and Skoda Octavia. Then it’s the Kia Sportage SUV, Toyota’s Yaris supermini and the Volkswagen Tiguan. The Ford Fiesta and Toyota C-HR crossover round out the top-ten.
A final dig into the stats for the new car registrations this year show that there were small improvements for April and May over the same months in 2017. Buyers have a wealth of choice in the market and every single manufacturer has tempting ‘182’ offers in place. Now’s a really good time to get a bargain new car.
I got into this line of work as much for my passion for motoring as for writing and, while I still genuinely enjoy driving all manner of cars, from the cheapest family vehicle to the most luxurious SUV, I’d be lying if I said I don’t get excited by the prospect of a week with a high-performance model.
The stars aligned for my time with the new Audi RS 4 Avant to allow me to spend a couple of days in West Cork and Kerry, taking in the famous Healy Pass and other just as scenic and spectacular parts of the Munster area.
The RS 4 Avant is based on Audi’s A4 estate, but it doesn’t take a motoring geek such as me to realise that it’s something special, as blistered wheelarches, large alloy wheels and big air vents hint at the performance potential underneath.
Power comes from a sonorous twin-turbocharged 2.9-litre V6 petrol engine, putting out 450hp and 600Nm of torque. That’s all kept in check by the quattro four-wheel-drive system, which makes this car devastatingly fast, regardless of the conditions.
And while you can’t really use much of this power on the public road in Ireland, it still manages to thrill the driver and feel like a real occasion at sane speeds. It helps that the interior is beautifully appointed in a sporting theme and yet is just as practical as any other A4 estate.
Though pricing starts at €102,350 and this would have been a good trip in a bargain basement hire car because of the scenery, in the Audi, it’s one that I’ll remember forever.

WordPress turned 15 years old at the end of May and the platform is now the engine behind 30 per cent of the world’s websites, powering major media and ecommerce sites, as well as small blogs — the personal projects that inspired its creation.
WordCamp Belfast was held to mark the occasion with sessions for users of all levels.
Blacknight backed the event and its chief executive, Michele Neylon, used the time to reflect on the growth of WordPress.
“The initial movement came from bloggers who had outgrown those services and wanted more freedom to develop their sites. But we soon saw small businesses and website developers turn to WordPress also, not just because it was free, but because it was powerful and flexible as well,” said Neylon.
“WordCamp attendees have that open-source, DIY attitude. They’re makers and creators: they don’t sit around waiting for things to happen. They make them happen. We love the engagement we get with our customers at these kind of events.”

Highlight: Each of the 20 show gardens at this year’s event comes carrying a message of some kind - but all of them are veritable feasts for the eyes 
Body


The show gardens at Bloom in the Park, Ireland’s biggest horticultural event, are like a catwalk. Designers strut their stuff hoping their gardens will strike a chord with visitors and be the talk of the season. Strong, accomplished designers have ensured the standard of the gardens is high this year with a range of garden styles inspired by a range of topics.
Whatever their size, each of the 20 show gardens is delivering a message or commenting on the world around us.
Andrew Christopher Dunne’s Sustainable Seafood Garden for Bord Iascaigh Mhara, winner of the overall best in show award, is a tour de force and popular with the other designers at the show.
It depicts a harbour scene that combines sentimental and sophisticated elements beautifully.
Getting a boat to fit the scale of the garden proved a challenge, and the boat we see moored to the harbour wall is a composite of three boats: the hull is from a river Thames police boat found in Donegal, and the wheelhouse is from a crabbing boat in Dundalk. The 60-ton harbour wall is made from reclaimed stone from a Presbyterian church in Belfast, and the artisan table is made of Irish elm.
“The reason we used elm is that all the elm trees died out 30 years ago, due to Dutch Elm disease,” says Dunne. It’s a reminder that if we don’t look after our natural resources, we can lose them, which ties into the sustainability drive behind the seafood industry.”
FBD Insurance’s Deep Play Garden, designed by Niall Maxwell and Marina Andreeva, is a contemporary, lush garden with contrasting edgy black water feature softened with skillful planting, and triangular sculptures under the shade of birch trees.
The sponsors were keen to highlight their move into the urban market from a traditionally rural base, and commissioned a garden to reflect this. Planted with yellow aquilegia, irises, epimedium, valerian, Angelica, eremurus, and Mukdenia ‘Crimson fans’, Maxwell and Andreeva have created a stunning tranquil space with a restful atmosphere suited to a family who like to spend time in nature.
[caption id="attachment_417838" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Monty Richardson and Peter Cowell Pic: Áine Keating[/caption]
Kevin Dennis’s design, the Fruit Juice Matters Garden, is confidently stylish with bold clean lines at an angle across the plot. Zingy orange accents and a purple and orange planting palette help to anchor the über-cool pavilion.
Oliver and Liat Schurmann have done it again with their A Different Outlook Garden for Savills – the skill of their creation becomes apparent when viewed from inside the office, where you get a worm’s eye view of nature.
Each view offers a different vista of pools and planting: a moss garden, Iris confusa, meconopsis, aspidistra, ferns, acers, larch and white St Daboecia heather make up some of the carefully considered and restrained planting. Never would you have imagined it possible to be so immersed in nature on the rooftop of a corporate building.
Brian Burke’s Moving Statues to Marriage Equality Garden celebrates Woodie’s 30-year anniversary, and is an engaging representation of how far we have come as a society over the last three decades. Along the walls are photos of seminal moments in recent Irish history, featured in a fun representation of a nation evolving.
With his garden, Life Is Rosé for Santa Rita ‘Living La Vida 120’, Alan Rudden has brought us the sunny, arid planting of a laid-back Chilean terrace. With a bright yellow wall as a backdrop, the planting consists of yucca, agaves, salvia, Pittosporum tobira nana and multi-stemmed strawberry trees that have been pruned back to frame the inviting space effectively.
Yellow is a big theme in the Marie Keating SunSmart Garden designed by Monty Richardson and Peter Cowell. It is an uplifting and fun garden with a serious message. Chief executive Liz Yeats said 11,000 people are diagnosed with skin cancer every year – more than 1,000 of them with melanoma, which can be fatal.
“The message of the foundation is about early detection and prevention, so we are encouraging people to be sun smart in the sun: wear a hat, go into the shade, wear long sleeves, avoid the sun between 11am and 3pm, wear sunglasses and apply suncream repeatedly,” she said.
The strong use of yellow reflects the positive fact that skin cancer is preventable. Also, new treatments mean that people can live in remission for longer. The twisting, undulating pathway reflects the highs and the lows of the cancer journey after diagnosis. There are tranquil areas in the shade reflecting the fact that people need to take their time.
“I’ve had cancer myself,” Yeats said, “and it’s a long journey. There are dark parts to that journey, but there are lots of bright twists and turns as well.”
The Sanctuary Nurture Garden by Dominic O’Donohoe with Sanctuary Synthetics is a delightful space that was created for the Phoenix Park Special School, which caters for children who experience social, emotional and behavioural challenges. At the centre of the design is a heart-shaped outdoor learning area complete with six throne seats and a stone teaching station, representing the 6:1 student-teacher ratio at the school.
Treehouses are becoming aspirational features in gardens now, and any child or adult who sees the quirky Dr Seuss-inspired treehouse in the little Enchanted Wood Garden, by Peter O’Brien of Plan Eden, will want one of their own. Complete with cleverly installed ‘stream’ and rope bridge it is an evocative woodland space on a very small scale.
And these are only half the gardens vying for your attention this weekend. Bloom is open today and tomorrow from 9am to 6pm. Under-16s go free; see bloominthepark.com for more details.

A butter mountain to climb for Aryzta as debts continue to rise

Highlight: With profit projections waning and a crippling debt that’s not going away, the Swiss-Irish company Aryzta is facing a period of uncertainty 
Body


When Kevin Toland moved from the Dublin Airport Authority to take over the Swiss-Irish bakery business Aryzta, he had a great many challenges to confront.
There was Aryzta’s problems in North America, its enormous debt mountain, the need to dramatically restructure the business, the tricky relationship with joint-venture partner Lion Capital and its desire to offload Picard, in which it had bought a stake to the chagrin of its shareholders.
Amid all of that, he can be forgiven for not expecting the price of butter to be his problem: and yet it is.
Since the start of the year, the price of 100 kilos of butter has risen from €455 to €565. While it’s still substantially lower than the €650 per 100 kilos that prevailed when Toland took the job, it’s a substantial – and material – rise.
Nor is it Aryzta’s only problem: it is also seeing a decline in the strength of two of its core markets, Germany and the US, with associated problems related to Brexit.
But the price of butter has become an emblem for the difficult market in which Aryzta is attempting to achieve this turnaround – and for how difficult a job it has become for Toland lately.
And while much of the bad-news momentum behind the company predates Toland, he is now the one tasked with reversing its fortunes. And his honeymoon period has been well and truly cut short.
In Aryzta’s last call with equity analysts, for example, he got yet another tongue-lashing over the news that the company was once again downgrading its earnings forecast – the company’s third time doing so since he was appointed chief executive – which implies a drop of about 30 per cent from 2017 for the beleaguered company. In short, where Aryzta was last year telling its shareholders it would make a profit of €420 million for the year, it is now guiding that it might make slightly less than €300 million.
Warren Ackerman of Société Génerale scalded Toland on the call, saying: “I’m still a bit surprised that you’re still saying that you’re underestimating the challenges in the group. You knew in your due intelligence the big issues and all the factors that you’re flagging today are the same factors as we’ve heard before. So, I’m still struggling a little bit to see another reason for the double-digit downgrade.”
As he pithily put it: “The question still is, how can we be confident that there will not be a further warning before the end of the year?”
Toland still can’t answer that question and the markets are betting against him. Aryzta is one of the most heavily shorted companies in Switzerland, with nearly a quarter of its shares out on short trades by funds which anticipate the share price will drop lower.
All of which has led several market observers to wonder whether the end result for Aryzta will not be a heroic turnaround, but ultimately a sale.
The problem for Aryzta is not butter alone, but butter tells you about the company’s health.
As Ian Hunter of Investec pointed out: “Some of the issues that are impacting Aryzta are impacting everyone else and you have to be flexible to deal with it.”
The problem for Aryzta, he said, was that the butter issue was like a winter flu virus – robust and healthy companies can survive it with very little problem, but weakened companies like Aryzta get walloped by the infection.
“Let’s say you’re a stable, solid business with a strong relationship with your clients: most people would be able to pass a price increase through,” he said, meaning they could encourage their clients (other businesses) to simply raise their prices to offset Aryzta’s higher costs.
“They’d be able to say to Lidl, Aldi or McDonalds, ‘You know our situation, can we pass some of this through?’ But in a weakened state they have less flexibility.”
Worse, they’re now operating in much more competitive markets – and the most recent figures prove this.
Before Toland took over, North America was its only substantial problem market, and the company was working through those problems by selling off assets and withdrawing from the ill-judged effort to sell direct to consumers – in direct competition with the businesses it was also trying to sell to.
However, since the start of the year, Europe has become unexpectedly weak.
As Hunter put it: “Some of their clients in Germany are insourcing their production.” This means that, instead of asking Aryzta to produce their baked goods, they’re producing them in-house.
“The impact was slightly higher than the market was projected. They’re thinking now that it’s economically viable to do it ourselves, which is another competitive threat to an outsourcing bakery model in this highly competitive market.”
This comes very close to being an existential problem, along with the move by consumers away from the type of products Aryzta sells – high-sugar, high-fat and full of gluten. Hunter is not alone in his views.
Fintan Ryan of German bank Berenberg pointed out that while Aryzta managed to eke out some small gains in North America – the decline was 1.3 per cent rather than 7.5 per cent, largely down to the sale of loss-making units like its Cloverhill bakery – Europe suffered a decline in business of 2.6 per cent compared to a growth of 1.7 per cent the year before.
This was partly due to tough market conditions in Britain, but also because of a “step-up in German customer insourcing”, and he pointed out that “these pressures are likely to continue to drag into 2019”.
A great chunk of the problem is those very recent changes at the very top of the company. Not only have they been recent and wholesale, but the existing management team was replaced by executives with little or no experience in the bakery industry.
Toland, for example, came from the Dublin Airport Authority; chief financial officer Frederic Pflanz is formerly of L’Oréal; while its North America boss Dave Johnson is from chocolate and cocoa maker Barry Callebaut.
None of those three have been in the job longer than eight months, while both Pflanz and Johnson have only been in place since January.
For Fintan Ryan, it means they have less than two years’ combined experience in trying to guide a struggling business in a challenging market – and they simply may not have seen the problems coming.
“It’s like trying to catch a falling knife,” he said of the company’s fortunes. “There are so many moving parts we have zero visibility on them. Even on the inside, the visibility seems quite poor.
“I wouldn’t have any conviction that this is the bottom and that things are going to be fine from now on – we’ve had false dawns before.”
Meanwhile, the restructuring – which is supposed to allow the company to grow again – has been slow and opaque.
Even the cost of the necessary cuts is not clear. The company says it intends to cut costs by €200 million, but has given no clear indication from where in the business.
As Patrik Schwendimann of Swiss bank ZKB said in a recent note, it wasn’t even clear how much the cuts will cost, calculating himself that it would cost €150 million over the next four years.
The biggest issue, though, is the company’s debt, which is currently four times earnings and causing it real trouble, since it has a covenant arrangement with its bankers to reduce that ratio year by year.
According to Schwendimann: “The covenant as per July 31, 2018 (net debt/[earnings] of 4.00x) is likely to just about be satisfied as Aryzta can obviously count the Picard special dividend of €91 million to [earnings].”
Excluding that special dividend, though, the covenant for the following year is far out of reach and will require major divestment, rising earnings or fundraising of some sort – none of which are particularly appealing to a weakened Aryzta.
In the short term, the company will be able to meet the terms of its debt covenants, but in the longer term it will have to either grow revenues dramatically or cut back even more dramatically to get rid of the heavy debt burden entirely.
And that may well be on the cards. Ian Hunter pointed out that news of a major disposal is likely to be very close, especially given the management team’s bullishness about meeting the covenant terms. “Several times [on the last analyst call] they said they would meet covenant levels at the end of this financial year,” he said. “At the moment we’re sitting with them having to inject around €335 million of cash into the business to get the covenant level down to four times net debt to earnings.”
“We have Picard valued at €365 million at full value, so if they got that away within the next two months, then yes, they’ve cleared it.
“Because they’ve said it several times, you can conclude that either that deal is close to completion, or they have something else that they are looking to sell.”
That may lift the storm clouds for a while, but solving the debt problem is only part of the solution to Aryzta’s problems.
According to one person familiar with the company – who didn’t want to be named in this piece – the company is unlikely to see any real improvement in the market conditions before the end of the summer, which raises the possibility of a sale.
“The only thing that will reassure the markets is numbers. The underlying business will either stabilise in spring/summer or it will not,” this individual said.
“If you look at this warning, it implies that trading into spring and summer is poor – roll that forward and how bad will it be?
“If it gets tougher and they can’t deliver the numbers, key shareholders will get restless and one of the options open to them is to put it up on the block and see if there are any bidders.
“A major global food company could potentially refinance the debt, get things done quicker and change the tenor around Picard.”
Even if the company doesn’t sell itself wholesale, it’s going to have to make some major cuts – and that will include large sales of some of its business units.
According to Ryan of Berenberg: “With high debt levels and poor returns, the clear focus is on deleveraging by €1 billion by 2020.” Many market observers feel that could be achieved by flogging off assets such as Picard in Europe and its two North American businesses, La Brea and Otis Spunkmeyer.
Whatever happens, Aryzta faces a prolonged period of major turbulence, and most analysts are convinced that a turnaround for the Swiss-Irish bakery giant will de facto mean radical restructuring.
As Schwendimann of ZKB pointed out in a recent note: “In the worst case scenario, customer orders will be lost to a large extent and Aryzta would not be able to survive in the form in which it exists today.”
Only time will tell what that form will take.

A hatful of Hollow from Yeats at Bonham’s sale

Highlight: After a long dry season, Jack B Yeats painted a series of major canvases in 1936, one of which pays tribute to a half-forgotten Irish sporting hero 
Body


An Irish masterpiece leads Bonham’s Modern British and Irish Art Sale in London next week. Jack B Yeats’s Donnelly’s Hollow, 61×91.5cm, is expected to fetch £300,000-£500,000.
Painted in 1936, it features a self-portrait of the artist and another man standing in a verdant landscape gazing at the stone obelisk erected in 1888 to commemorate the celebrated 19th-century Irish boxer Dan Donnelly.
In 1815, Donnelly took up the challenge to fight the English champion George Cooper. Twenty thousand people travelled to Co Kildare to see the fight – and witnessed Donnelly’s victory in the 11th round when he knocked out Cooper and won the prize money of £60.
Because it took place within a few years of the Act of Union, the defeat of an Englishman on Irish soil was significant, and overnight Donnelly was a national hero. Alas, his good times were short-lived. Having succumbed to alcoholism, he died aged 32 in 1820. Legend has it that his body was disinterred by medical students and his right arm was displayed in a Kilcullen pub for many decades.
Boxing was one of Yeats’s many passions. He owned a copy of the 19th-century ballad Donnelly And Cooper, and his illustrations of the boxer appeared on two occasions in the Cuala Press. So far, so good - but, Yeats being Yeats, there’s more to the painting than Donnelly.
In the early 1930s, due to the increase in his literary output, he completed very few paintings. Then, in 1936, he executed a series of major canvases, of which Donnelly’s Hollow is one. All are concerned with the role of memory, Yeats’s own but also national, and communal sense of memory.
This explains the contemplative stance of the two figures, far apart, each lost in his own reverie, possibly meditating on their own mortality, and oblivious to the gaggle of young girls passing by – the next generation ready to pick up life’s baton and run with it.
A regrettable side-effect of progress is the way it has industrialised the countryside. Four works in the sale by Paul Henry include a charming oil entitled Hayricks. When you think of the modern equivalent – round bales of hay, machine-wrapped in black plastic – it’s hardly an image you’d want to hang on the wall.
Hayricks and a second Henry, Achill Cottage, Lough Corrib, both reveal that although the location looks idyllic, life in the West was harsh before progress – note how, in both paintings, the Atlantic gales have distorted the trees. Hayricks, unsigned, measures 24×36cm and has an estimate of £15,000-£20,000. Achill Cottage, Lough Corrib, slightly larger at 25.7×40.8cm, and signed, is expected to fetch £60,000-£80,000.

Acknowledging the contribution of the NFP sector

In the fast-paced world of business, voluntary organisations and charities can easily be overlooked; their presence acknowledged, but not taken as seriously as the big movers and shakers in the business world.
But not recognising the huge role that not-for-profit (NFP) organisations play in the running of the country, and indeed our economy, is a mistake.
There are currently 9,932 charities operating in Ireland (a subset of the country’s 29,000 civil society organisations). Every community in the country has an army of volunteers, with over a quarter of adults aged 15 years and above volunteering every year.
If these huge numbers were paid even the minimum wage, the cost to the economy would be astronomical.
“The work the legion of unpaid volunteers does amounts to a huge input into the economy,” said Ivan Cooper, director of public policy with The Wheel. “Recent figures from CSO research has shown that if these volunteer hours were applied to the minimum wage, it would amount to €2 billion per year of work being done around the country.
“The NFP sector is hugely significant and the contribution of volunteers is massive, but it is not appreciated. Not many people realise that the annual turnover from non-profit organisations is €12.1 billion and this very significant sum is under the control of the 50,000 volunteer trustees who have responsibility for overseeing the public service work done with this money.”
Of this turnover, just under half comes from the state and the rest is either earned or raised by voluntary organisations themselves. Unsurprisingly, The Wheel, which is the national association for community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises, is keen to make people aware of the massive contribution its members make to the country.
[caption id="attachment_417991" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Ivan Cooper, director of public policy at The Wheel[/caption]
“One of our jobs is to raise awareness of what the sector does for the country and to make sure that there is a supportive national policy environment for all this work,” said Cooper.
“While the sector has been through a challenging period in recent years with funding reductions, a corner has been turned, and the future is bright. Fundraising income is up since 2014, the government is developing a strategy to support the sector and to support social enterprise, and the Charities Regulator is up and running at full speed ahead.
“There is a comprehensive range of new regulations in place with published guidance around fundraising, and shortly we will see a governance code and new standardised financial reporting requirements for charities. These are all very positive developments that will help maintain the public’s trust and confidence in the vital work of the sector – but we need to recognise that compliance comes at a cost.”
Cooper noted there has always been a focus on ‘what’ charities do and what’s changed in recent years is that there is now an equal attention paid to the ‘how’ they do it. This is good and right and the highest governance standards are always required in charities.
“What has changed in recent years is the huge investment the state has made, rightly, in regulation and compliance requirements, processes and systems – so charities, especially those funded in large part by the state, now work to a whole range of quality standards, regulatory requirements and reporting requirements.
“The problem is that meeting these requirements comes with costs, and there’s been no equivalent investment in charities to enable them to meet the cost of compliance. Also, many charities find themselves reporting the same information to many funders and regulators over and over again. A typical charity will have to report to the Companies Registration Office, Charities Regulator, their funders, and comply with requirements and code of governance for whichever field they are in - for example the housing agency or the HSE. Therefore, we are calling on government to streamline and rationalise the compliance and reporting requirements and that state bodies make funds available to the charities they work with to meet the costs of compliance.”
Additionally, Cooper noted that many state funders were moving towards commissioning for services. “We need to make sure that the added value that our charities bring to the work that they do, the commitment of volunteers and staff, the assets that they make available in communities and the additional funds they raise, are valued and taken into account when state agencies are commissioning services,” he said. “This will ensure that that the ethos and values of the community and voluntary approach are reflected in the commissioned services.”
Another issue addressed at The Wheel’s conference, according to Cooper, is the increasing reluctance of people across the public service to take chances and trust those frontline organsiations and personnel on the ground who have the best understanding of local needs, and who are as a result increasingly waiting for approval from the top on even the smallest of decisions.
“The problem is that everyone in the system is accounting upwards to bureaucracy instead of accounting downwards and outwards to the people and communities they serve, so we think there is a great opportunity for the charity sector to show leadership for the public service as a whole,” he said.
“We are asking charities to look at how they communicate and share information. We want them to see if they can better model ‘downwards and outwards’ accountability and service-innovation and show leadership around meeting people’s needs. The system needs to encourage that and put as much emphasis on that type of accountability as it does to reporting upwards. The challenge is that public services are increasingly becoming too centralised and bureaucratic. This is resulting in a culture of fear with people being reluctant to innovate and take risks.
“No one wants to be accused of making a mistake, but we need to reconnect and be responsive to human beings at a community level and provide an antidote to the overly risk aversive bureaucratic approach that is currently in evidence. We are calling on the government to let charities and community and voluntary organisations get on with what they do best, namely innovating to meet people’s needs. In addition, state agencies should commit to working with the sector to map the comprehensive service that people and communities require and then fund those services in full.”
Irish people have always been altruistic and willing to donate both time and money to help others, but in order for the sector to continue to thrive, Cooper said the government needed to offer more support, and the public sector needed to trust charities and voluntary organisations to respond to local need and to manage local affairs.
“Our sector is an incredible national resource which is available to everyone,” he said. “We need to support volunteers and charities as much as possible and allow the sector to give a voice to the spirit of altruism in the Irish people. Volunteering is part of our identity. We need to find a way of harnessing this for the common good.
“We also need the government to reform the public sector around downward and outward accountability, particularly in relation to governance. At the moment, public servants understand their job to be to execute the will of their ministerial masters, rather than to represent the needs of the people. We need to turn this on its head and provide a new framework so that all state agencies, and the charities they work with, can reorientate themselves to responding and accounting more directly to people’s needs.
“The Wheel believes we need a new framework for participatory governance in Ireland. Charities are ready to co-operate and collaborate with the government, so we can serve our citizens to the best of our ability.”

Alcohol bill raises concerns

Body


The director general of Spirits Europe met Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed last month to express concerns about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. The bill would allow for minimum pricing, the labelling of health warnings on alcohol products and restrictions in relation to the advertising and sponsorship of alcohol.
Ulrich Adam, director general of Spirits Europe which represents the spirits industry in 24 European countries, said national initiatives like the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill can undermine the common achievements in the internal EU market, adding that Spirits Europe was in favour of harmonised EU approaches.
“We have grave concerns about what the law could mean for the functioning of internal markets. We see the potential trade barriers and what it could mean for the free flow of goods and limiting choice for consumers in the Irish market, but also limiting the ability for smaller spirits producers to be present in the Irish market,” he said. “While we fully support national initiatives to address harmful alcohol consumption, we very much stress that these measures must be taken in a way that do not undermine or hamper the proper functioning of the internal market.”
Adam said there was an “encouraging reaction” from the Minister for Agriculture about Spirits Europe’s concerns around the draft law, which is currently before the Dáil, having taken two years to make its way through the Seanad. “They are aware of the potential problems that this law could cause. There was of course no clear answer as to where things are going to go, but there was a clear awareness about these problems.”
There has been a renaissance in the Irish alcohol industry, he said, although it is operating against a difficult global trade climate with Brexit and US tariffs. China offers a huge opportunity for the sector, Adam said, as it is such a large market and has a favourable import regime as it cut tariffs by 50 per cent in January for whiskey, brandy and cognac.

Beware the allure of high-income bonds

Length: 1389 words

Highlight: They may seem like a tempting alternative to cash or other asset classes, but investing in corporate bonds is a complicated business 
Body


Brokers, wealth managers and, dare I say it, wide boys in the ‘wealth management’ and ‘personal financial advice’ field will never be short of a good, convincing story. But without jumping to conclusions, or putting everyone in the so-called wealth management industry in the same box, you should always be wary and questioning.
Selling equities over the past three years hasn’t been much of a problem for stockbrokers. The charts have been good and the rising tide has lifted most boats. The Iseq is up 75 per cent, the Ftse 250 is up 68 per cent, the CAC40 is up 38 per cent, while the DAX is up 57 per cent and all the key US indices climbed strongly too. But the time will come, and it may not be far off (note last week’s mini tremor), when equity markets soften after a very long, strong bull run.
It’s not surprising that so many investors, even some of the more experienced, have become hooked on the feelgood factor of a rising equity portfolio, be it within a pension fund or held directly. The longer this goes on, the more shocked – maybe even panicked – they are likely to be if they see the nicely growing nest egg of equities they have built up suddenly shrinking in value – and perhaps shrinking at a high-teen or more percentage rate over quite a short time scale. There was a wobble last week, but it had reversed by the end of the week, reflecting the volatile reaction of the markets to single events, which often get dramatised and resolved in double quick time, but not always.
At some stage, equity investment will begin – temporarily – to seem less attractive than other asset classes. Then equity investors are likely to be tempted to turn their attention elsewhere and seek out alternative asset class opportunities – perhaps the superficially more attractive and (sometimes) superficially safer bond markets.
There are, of course, lots of other options, property being traditionally the most popular among Irish investors despite the crash of a decade ago and also despite the fact that a neater, more convenient and arguably much cheaper route to exposure to the property market is through the equity market, ie buying well-managed property company shares. That’s because shares in listed property companies usually trade at a discount to their net asset value per share of the company in question.
That discount usually reflects the existence of a dilution of earnings from the property assets of the company by virtue of the expense of management of the property and of the company that owns the listed property company in whose equity you have invested. You could say that the share price discount to the net asset value of the company per share is compensated for by management’s value added contribution to maximising returns from the portfolio and hence enhancing the net asset value per share.
Investing in the shares of a property company whose management is proven and experienced should, more often than not, deliver better returns, more liquidity, greater diversity and less risk for an investor than buying one or two individual properties on his or her own.
But timing and gearing considerations are as important as management calibre when investing in property as an asset class, be it directly or through a listed stock market company.
As for other asset classes, cash has been almost universally regarded as “trash” at least for the past decade due to the near-zero interest rates that it earns in nominal terms and less in real terms. And if rates rise it may well be due to the cold comfort of emerging inflationary pressures or, as at present, a severe disturbance in the eurozone as euro members (Italy is not alone) disregard the disciplines required under the stability and growth pact.
That aside, even with interest rates a point or two higher than now, a real return from cash above inflation will continue to be hard to sustain over a long period. The accessibility of some other asset classes, such as agricultural land or commodities (hard and soft), is limited and they will usually only be remotely sensible for most people via professionally managed funds. This dilutes returns materially as such funds usually carry expensive fees .
All of that brings me to an obvious and easily accessible asset class that can offer a decent prospective return over and above the return from cash and that is normally lower risk than equities. The asset class I refer to is corporate bonds. These bonds come in many different forms and sizes and have varying risk characteristics and risk profiles, but they have two important advantages over equities. The first is an annual coupon which is usually much more certain than the fluctuating – and usually lower – annual dividend from an equity. Even in a very weak trading period a quality company should continue to be able to pay the coupon on the bond, whereas a sizeable percentage of companies’ dividends get substantially cut or totally eliminated in a weak industry/economic environment.
By contrast, the interest payment on the bonds takes precedence over dividend payments, hence its greater reliability. Suspending those interest payments will invariably constitute a breach of contract and the bond issuer then goes into default.
But while most investors know that an interest payment obligation to bondholders as outlined in a company’s bond prospectus must be paid as contractually scheduled, and must rank ahead of dividends payments to shareholders which will often get cancelled or cut in a downturn, there can nevertheless be a number of nasty shocks for bondholders that may not be specifically obvious to the uninitiated. Specifically, I am thinking of two shocks that can arise from the structure of very many bond issues and from some clauses in the fine print of many bond prospectuses.
There is a general assumption among bond investors that they will rank ahead of equity investors in a meltdown scenario and they usually will. But in such a scenario that may be cold comfort. The question is: will they get paid out ahead of other creditors? And the answer to that question is: “maybe not’’.
To a significant extent the answer will be determined by from where within the corporate group structure the bond has been issued and to what extent, arising from that, the bondholder will have a priority claim on the assets of the group ahead of other creditors. The reality is that bond issues can often be made in an entity within a group structure of companies where the most valuable assets are not in the corporate entity in which the bond is issued nor in the entity or entities where the majority of the operating and financial assets of the group are held.
In those circumstances, unless there are specific guarantees for the bondholders from those latter entities, then the direct bank lenders to those asset holding entities and the company’s trade creditors will probably have priority claim over those assets in a wind-up, unless the bond holder has guarantees from those entities and security over their assets that would rank in priority to other creditors.
In many instances, this is not only not the case, but there is another aspect which can weaken the position of the bondholders as well: frequently, the prohibition clause included in bond documentation on the granting of security to third parties is a very limited prohibition. Often it involves a prohibition only on the granting of security to issuers of other bonds, but not on the granting of security for, for example, bank debt. This can prove a big negative for bond investors when it comes to claims, enabling bank debt and perhaps trade creditors to get ahead of, or rank on equal terms with, the claims of the bondholders.
So the “takeaway” from all of this is that bond investing is far from simple: the quality of the documentation, the domicile of the bond within the group structure, the existence or otherwise of inter-company guarantees, the extent of third-party debt and creditors, and the claims they may have across the group entities – all of these things can make a very material difference to the real underlying risks for bondholders. And, as the last financial crisis showed, you can’t rely on even the world’s most prominent rating agencies to assess the risk of default for you. When it comes to corporate bonds, it’s a case of caveat emptor.

Bill Gross was awake for his nightmare

Highlight: Bond guru plotting his next move after suffering steepest loss since the inception of $2.1 billion organisation 
Body


Bond guru Bill Gross had a really bad day on Tuesday. In fact, it was the steepest loss for his $2.1 billion Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund since its inception in 2014.
And, on the face of it, that’s fine – all investors have their victories and setbacks. But what’s strange is that Gross seemed to be positioned against his own advice and suffered greatly because of it.
Some numbers just jump off a screen, and an effective duration of minus 4.58 years certainly qualifies.
Usually a positive number, duration measures the gain or loss for a given move in bonds.
In Gross’s case, an increase in yields would net a substantial profit. It boils down to a big bet against the overall market. (For context, the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index has a duration of more than six years.)
Worst. Day. Ever. Bill Gross’s flagship fund has plunged as safe-haven assets like Treasuries and bonds have rallied
Sure, Gross made headlines by calling the start of a bond bear market in January, when the ten-year Treasury yield broke through 25-year trend lines. But ever since, his public comments sounded as if he was walking that back, all the while apparently taking his duration down even further. His fund is down 5.9 per cent for the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Here are just a few of his statements, from the Janus Henderson US Twitter account, his investment outlook and interviews:
January 29: “As predicted weeks ago, bonds are now in a bear market. You should expect, however, for only gradual increases in 10-year yields from here. Perhaps 2.90 per cent by year-end 2018.”
February 2: “Bond bear market will be “relatively mild”.”
March 22: “Investors should therefore look for 3 per cent plus or minus on the ten-year for the balance of 2018. That level should ultimately force German bunds and UK gilts to higher yields, perhaps 1 per cent on bunds and 1.75 per cent on gilts. Still, in my mind, this is a hibernating global bear bond market, not a beast.”
May 2: “Supply from the Treasury is a factor in addition to what the Fed might do in terms of a mild, bearish tone for U.S. Treasury bonds . . . I would expect the ten-year to basically meander around 2.80 to perhaps 3.10 or 3.15 for the balance of the year. It’s a hibernating bear market, which means the bear is awake but not really growling.”
As a reminder, the ten-year Treasury yield crossed 2.9 per cent in mid-February, broke 3 per cent in late April and peaked at 3.126 per cent on May 18. Given that movement, and his comments, how does that justify a massively negative duration? (Note: some of the fund’s performance may have also been tied to bets against bunds; the German ten-year yield fell to an 11-month low on Tuesday.)
Even Franklin Templeton bond chief Michael Hasenstab, who says the ten-year Treasury yield can reach 4 per cent, isn’t so gutsy. His $38.2 billion Templeton Global Bond Fund had an average duration of minus 0.85 years as of March 31, a record low.
He said earlier this month that he’s “comfortable with where it is”. As he should be. The cost of being short in the bond market is high, regardless of whether it moves against you, as it did on Tuesday. That’s because investors effectively give up some income – or “carry”, as some call it – which is a crucial component of their total return. There’s a reason the aggregate US bond index has posted only three annual losses since the 1970s.
Gross also relies, in part, on selling the equivalent of insurance against big-market moves, which isn’t exactly a winning strategy when volatility climbs.
And that probably added to the fund’s losses. But at least it makes sense in the context of his mild bear market call.
He declined to comment to Bloomberg News on the performance.
In the end, he’s mostly hurting only himself. Almost $700 million in the Janus unconstrained fund was Gross’s personal money as of June 30, 2017, according to filings. A bad day, indeed. Pic: Bloomberg

BMW M3 is singing its swansong
Sunday Business Post
June 1, 2018

Length: 597 words
Byline: Post Reporter
Body


My, the BMW M3 has come a long way. The original, based on the ‘E30’ BMW 3 Series of 1985, was a boxy two-door coupé powered by a naturally aspirated 2.3-litre four-cylinder petrol engine sending about 200hp to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual gearbox.
That car is revered by car enthusiasts and it’s an appreciating classic, as much for its upright period styling and ‘box-flared’ wheelarches as its handling prowess. It was also one of the first BMW M road cars as we know them today.
And today we’re at the wheel of the latest, probably the last iteration of the current generation M3. The ‘F80’ BMW 3 Series will be replaced by a brand-new car by the end of 2018 and that will no doubt spawn an all-new M3 before long. To send the current one off in style is the new limited-edition M3 CS. Compare its vital stats with its forebear: it’s a four-door saloon powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine, sending 460hp to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch M DCT gearbox.
Like the limited-edition M4 CS that preceded it, there’s more performance, less weight, more equipment and a visual makeover to help the M3 CS stand out, though it all comes at a rather large premium.
In Ireland, the M3 CS is €154,700 on-the-road (excluding the current 9 per cent discount offer BMW has in place across the range), while the already-upgraded M3 Competition Package, with the M DCT gearbox, is ‘only’ a little over €110,000.
Can the newcomer really be worth more than €40,000 extra? The numbers might suggest not. Along with a mere 10kg weight reduction, BMW has recalibrated the twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine to liberate 10hp more, which is negligible, though it has another 50Nm of torque, which is far more useful.
Straight-line performance is, therefore, improved a tad, though if you ever considered the M3 underpowered, you need to have a word with yourself. Nonetheless, the extra torque gives the M3 CS a little more eagerness on the exit of corners.
Corners are important to this car, or rather the driver’s experience in the corners is important. And BMW’s M division has further enhanced the chassis to that end. At the centre of the changes are lighter (and simply stunning) forged alloy wheels, shod in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tyres, which are, shall we say, not optimised for damp Irish winters, but absolutely amazing on a dry road or race circuit.
The BMW M’s engineers tweaked the suspension to make the most of the stickier tyres and reduced ‘unsprung weight’, resulting in a car that is even faster than before around a track, yet also somehow more engaging than ever, so the driver doesn’t just feel like they’re along for the ride.
The most remarkable thing about this car’s driving dynamics is how the front tyres find and keep grip, even under duress. But that doesn’t mean it takes a herculean effort to keep the lively rear end of the car under control, as it’s incredibly stable and trustworthy too. Everything we liked about the M3’s chassis is present and correct, with high limits and adjustability, but it has all been enhanced a fraction, making the CS the most satisfying version of the genre yet to drive.
Aside from the driving experience, the CS gets a unique carbon fibre reinforced plastic bonnet and rear spoiler, plus a slightly pared-back interior, giving it a unique look.
Most people will probably still think it’s not worth the premium, but given that the European allocation of the 1,200-odd examples that will be manufactured is almost gone, it doesn’t matter what “most people” think, does it?

The Code Institute is making inroads in the North American market, where it has signed up third-level partners in Canada and the US.
The Dublin company has partnered with private colleges Lynn University in Florida Circleville, Ohio Christian University and Canadian Business College in Toronto ahead of plans for further expansion in the US and Europe in the months ahead.
“The purpose of these partnerships is to allow us to get our course certified and acknowledged for college credits in the US,” said Jim Cassidy, chief executive at the Code Institute. “US students looking to complete their degrees also take external courses that provide them with additional college credits and that’s an opportunity for us.”
The Code Institute was established in Dublin in 2015 by co-founders Anthony Quigley and Brendan Nevin, who were inspired by the emergence of bootcamp-style software development courses in the US.
Nevin is chief executive at AA Ireland. Quigley founded the Digital Marketing Institute and also runs conference and events company 3XE Digital.
“The idea of the bootcamp, or ’accelerated learning’, is to teach you how to become a software developer in three months,” said Cassidy, who joined the company in 2016, having been managing director at digital agency Isobar Dublin.
“We believed the model could work in Europe, but we wanted to take the in-class experience and bring it online, so we needed to create our own courseware.”
The Code Institute assembled an advisory council with industry representatives from companies including Accenture, GlaxoSmithKline, PayPal, Redhat and Project Foundry.
On foot of their advice on sought-after tech skills, the start-up developed its accredited Fullstack Diploma in Software Development course.
“We give our graduates the skills they need to get a job as a software developer on completion of our course,” said Cassidy. “Our course is academically validated. It’s recognised on the European Quality Framework and qualifies for college credits in the US.”
The Code Institute has 1,000 students in 27 countries and partners in ten countries. The company’s primary markets are Ireland, Britain, the Netherlands and the US.
“Technology is moving faster than companies can learn it,” said Cassidy. “In the Netherlands, for every 26 available jobs, there’s one available candidate. The supply and demand ratios are off the charts.”
The Code Institute has raised €1 million in funding to date over two rounds from investors Kernel Capital and Enterprise Ireland.
“Enterprise Ireland has offered us amazing support since the beginning,” said Cassidy. “One of the biggest challenges when entering a new market is understanding the cultural and economic differences and nuances.
“Enterprise Ireland typically have people on the ground, or have access to people who can answer the hard questions.”
The Code Institute employs 25 people directly and has 50 part-time subject matter experts on its books.

Construction industry is slowly but surely getting back on its feet

Highlight: Following a generation that will be remembered for bad builds, the dawn of a new era could be upon us, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body


The spectre of the housing crash still looms over the construction industry, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. The industry needs a “north star” for both cultural and professional standards, to ensure it moves in the right direction.
Speaking at the Building Regulations and Standards Summit at Croke Park, founder and chief executive of i3PT Certification Eoin Leonard said that simplicity should be the key to how the construction industry can move forward.
“As construction professionals, we have to act professionally,” he said. “There was a point in our society where construction professionals were held up in positions like surgeons and everyone else . . . because people relied on us to do something they couldn’t do - and we probably lost that place.
“Aside from all the complexities around standards and regulations, there has to be a very simple north star that if you’re a construction professional operating in the industry, you should do nothing that could result in harm to others.”
The events of the housing bubble have led to many changes to regulations and accountability among the industry. The introduction of CIRI (Construction Industry Register Ireland), an online register containing certified construction companies, sole traders and builders – and the decision to make it mandatory in 2017 – are steps towards regaining credibility.
“It was a small few that damaged the whole reputation of the industry and that’s why we said we needed a process to ensure that the reputation of good-quality builders is retained intact,” said Hubert Fitzpatrick, the director of development housing and planning services at Construction Industry Federation (CIF). “The registration of builders will do just that by preserving that integrity.
“The regulatory environment is continuously changing [as is] the need for continuous professional development and training. If we look at the regulatory environment compared to ten years ago, it’s a totally different ball game. If someone had not been involved in the industry in the last 10 to 15 years, they will be at a total loss.”
Leonard warned against the idea of treating different departments as if they’re the same thing, as the complexity would prevent solutions from being reached.
“The problem with building control, liability, insurance and consumer protection is that they are often lumped together, which makes a sensible debate difficult,” he said. “It’s important to take them at their constituent parts… it will never be 100 per cent fixed or resolved. It’s like saying you’re going to fix homelessness or mental health, it’s not something you can do. You can only make it better or worse and those are the types of goals we need to pursue.
“Anyone claiming that they have an overall solution or silver bullet solutions is either deluded, selling something or trying to raise their profile. While this is all true, we can’t be fatalist . . . and there are some common sense solutions to mitigate the more significant risks.”
Another part was the human element that plays through all parts of life; any initiative will fail unless cultural and professional standards are held to account.
A similar message was mentioned by the Minister for Housing and Urban Development, Damien English TD, who mentioned how the entire industry is aware of the effects low standards can have on it and the wider public.
“I think many in this room are familiar with what can go wrong – we can’t go back to that space,” he said. “It’s just not a place to be, to sit down with a family and see a house around that’s not fit for purpose, a place where they can’t raise a family, a place they invest hundreds of thousands into.
“It’s a duty we all have, that we never go back to that again, and we don’t see those failures in the system as well. Together we’re all working through it, dealing with those properties, and we’re making sure, with regulations and reforms, that it can’t happen again as well.”
Making the current situation more challenging is the demand for affordable housing.
English added: “There’s an urgency there to deliver housing as quickly as we possibly can. We’re very clear on this – they have to be of high quality and high standard that can conform to the conditions [required of them].
“We’re not just building houses; we’re building communities. So the urgency is there and the pressure is there in the system to make sure that we’re doing our job right. It is priority number one to bring back the supply of housing to deal with the market and give people the choice of where they want to live at the right price.”
One element that hangs over the construction industry is to ensure that regulations strike a balance between allowing those in the industry to work and grow while ensuring that bad actors are kept in check.
As part of his work across Europe, the OECD’s Daniel Trnka mentioned that Irish regulators could take inspiration from other sectors when looking for ways to improve.
“We are aware that there are significant differences among sectors when it comes to inspections. Enforcement in the area of environmental protection is different from food safety, different from construction, and building is different from occupational healthcare and safety,” he said.
“We also believe that there are many elements that are similar in all of these sectors. There are many things that can be shared across those sectors, [and] there is significant room for improvement.
“When I said that in many countries, governments are trying to reduce regulatory burdens and reduce administrative costs, enforcement and inspections are an important source of the administrative burdens.
“This cannot be reduced completely, it can’t be cut to zero definitely, but still there is a lot of potential room for improvement.”

Company: NRG Awareness
Done Deal: €2m investment
The clincher: “We have significant plans for growth over the coming years, which will result in major investment into the Irish economy” - Patrick Hogan, MD, NRG Awareness
NRG Awareness, the Cork-based home heating company established 20 years ago by plumber Harry Rea, will begin exporting to Britain and the US having secured funding of €2.5 million from Sea Box, the US-headquartered shipping and storage container company.
Rea and his son David, a mechanical engineer, started the company 20 years ago to develop efficient heating systems.
The pair developed the NRG Zone system, a rapid design and construction method for heating system that incorporates all of the different types of heating equipment in new-build and retrofit projects.
The company’s patented products include NRG Link, which can be used to interconnect open solid fuel systems to sealed heating systems, and NRG LEX, a simple wiring system for connecting electrical components in central heating systems.
The investment from Sea Box EMEA follows its recent acquisition of NRG Awareness, which saw managing director Patrick Hogan join the Reas in the dual role of managing director of NRG Awareness.
They plan to increase the number of plumbers they partner with in Ireland to 500 by 2020.
The company’s headcount is expected to increase from seven to 30 people in the same period.
Patrick Hogan said the company would launch a new heating product in Britain next month. He said the same product was at prototyping stage in the US.
“Everything we do will come out of Cork and there is a lot of potential there for jobs and exports,” said Hogan.
“When we acquired NRG, we came up with a focused plan to invest into different areas of the company.
“That includes new product innovation, new jobs and investment in e-commerce functionality for plumbers and installers. It’s all about saving time and making everything streamlined for the plumbing industry.
“On the mechanical side, we’re developing new systems for businesses and we’ll be able to offer them finance through any commercial entity up to €500,000.”

Dublin food company is sweet on low-sugar snacks and goods

Dublin food company 250Kal has closed a €400,000 funding round with investors including state agency Enterprise Ireland and private sources. The company was established three years ago by siblings Robert and Denise Hallam,
The company will launch a new range of low-calorie baked goods made with natural alternatives to sugar this year for the retail and convenience snack markets.
The Hallams came up with the idea for 250Kal ten years ago after Robert was diagnosed with diabetes.
“Sugar was taken off my menu, and I couldn’t find a treat that wasn’t stuffed full of artificial sugars or didn’t taste bland,” he said.
“Denise and I started fine-tuning some treats I’d been experimenting with. We persevered with all types of natural sugar alternatives until we managed to produce something we felt could stand up against the full sugar versions of similar products in the market.”
250Kal products are sold in more than 20 SuperValu outlets in Dublin and Wicklow. Hallam said the company was in discussions with a distributor with a view to rolling out nationwide distribution in the months ahead.
“We plan to enter international markets in the first quarter of 2019,” he said. “We’re looking at the US because, as a market, it has significant issues with sugar consumption, but there aren’t a lot of natural sugar alternatives in the sweet treat market over there.”
With external funding on board, 250Kal also has plans to bring new low-calorie treats and snacks to market.
“We are releasing a new chocolate range in the coming months and an even lower calorie range of cakes and treats that will compliment our 250-calorie range,” said Hallam.
“We will have products available in the on-the-go market later this year and we’re working on a range of treats that parents have been asking for, for their kids. They will be low in sugar and will contain a sugar that is ‘tooth-kind’ and doesn’t strip enamel.”
250Kal is a client company of Enterprise Ireland (EI). “Gaining their support has been a game-changer for us,” said Hallam.
“We can finally add talented people to help us in our innovation and put in place the strategies we have been building over the last three years. EI continues to connect us with experts who have helped us avoid costly mistakes.”
250Kal employs two people full-time and two part-time. Hallam said the company was in the process of moving production from Wicklow Enterprise Centre to an outsourced facility in Dublin.
“Working with alternative natural sugars has required lots of trial and error, because baking is something of a chemical process,” he said.
“The flavour profile has to be spot on, and the texture, colour and visual appeal have to be exactly in line with what customers expect.
“We completely reworked the mixing process, and we’re continuing to fine-tune and expand our recipes.”

Dublin office rents could drop in 2019, says expert
Sunday Business Post

Length: 895 words
Byline: Donal Buckley
Highlight: Gearóid Collins of IWG believes the market has reached a tipping point, writes Donal Buckley 
Body


Dublin office rents may see declines next year as the market is undergoing a major change with increasing resistance to long-term onerous leases.
That’s according to Gearóid Collins, country managing director in Ireland for IWG, the international serviced office provider which is both a tenant and a landlord, with about 27,900 square metres of offices in 15 locations in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.
In ten years, the Dublin property market “has gone from boom to bust to boom again”, Collins said.
“There is a change coming, though, and I believe that we are at the tipping point where we will see these [Dublin office] rents level off and reduce over next six to nine months,” he said.
Collins believes a key gauge for rental trends will be the amount of space leased over the next few months for those offices under construction and ready for occupation.
“If these percentages are slipping it will point to slowing down of occupier demand. We know there are some really big companies active in the market, and if there are significant transactions as a result, this will delay the slow down inevitably. Overall, I feel we will see a slowdown in take-up within the next six to nine months, as well as rents reducing,” he said.
Collins was speaking after IWG recently signed a deal to take a 25-year lease on 77 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay in Dublin 2, where it has been reported it would pay initial rent of €1.8 million or €538 per square metre.
This 3,195 square metre south Dublin Docklands venue, owned by Hibernia Reit, will be the location for its first Spaces serviced offices in Dublin.
“Spaces tends to suit a more tech-type company or start-up, and offers a club floor where customers can benefit from a wide range of amenities and break-out areas,” he said.
It is quoting €299 per month for a co-working desk and €899 per month for a two-person office at Spaces South Docklands.
Another IWG brand, Regus, offers corporate-style serviced offices. It has been operating in Ireland for decades and has nine locations in Dublin Ormond, Pembroke House, Regus House Harcourt, Alexandra House in Ballsbridge, Santry, The Chase in Sandyford, Regus Dublin Airport and the Gables in Foxrock. Another is expected to be signed soon.
IWG’s global brands also include Basepoint, Open office, Signature and Nr 18 at 3,000 locations around the world.
Collins is aware that the challenges which face landlords also present opportunities for IWG, as occupiers are increasingly wary of the risks of committing to long-term onerous leases.
“In this market, terms offered are unpalatable to tenants with not only high rents, but also long-term leases being demanded. The difference now, as opposed to the previous peak of 2007, is that companies want more flexibility, not less,” he said.
Collins believes that fast-changing technology has been one of the drivers of these changes in tenant attitudes.
“Technology has driven flexibility in business and digitalisation over the last ten years,” he said. “Companies now live in more agile and flexible business models. There is no going back.”
He is also somewhat critical of new developments. “The market is seeing a lot of offices being built to sell, as opposed to meeting occupier demand which can have a negative effect on take-up from companies looking in this size range [280 to 1,400 square metres].”
“When this happens, the principal objective does not have the end user in mind, but instead an end buyer in mind. As a result, companies are often presented with what they perceive as onerous lease terms, which are simply too costly in the long run and hamper the required injection of agility into their real estate portfolios and business models. The rise in flexible office space providers like IWG is meeting this demand for companies seeking smaller space,” he said.
But Collins also expects that even large companies will opt for more flexible space, following changes next year to international accountancy standards, which require rental leases to be included on company balance sheets. “I believe this will change how multinational businesses look at their global lease portfolio,” he said.
It is also his opinion that office landlords may be curtailed in how they respond to occupier requirements. Landlords, he said, “have made huge investments and they have to get their returns . . . and they are adding to the attraction of Ireland as a destination for businesses. Some of the product I see is really top quality, [but] they simply cannot become more agile overnight because that is not the model which formed the basis of how they received their funding”.
“What we see globally is that they are much more likely to partner with us than take this route themselves. We can take on these lengthy lease terms, take on large space and through our business model for more than 30 years we have been a consistent supplier of office space of all sizes on flexible terms across the globe.
This trend is also being seen increasingly in Ireland, as evinced by recent research in Savills’ Skyline survey.
It found that, in the last two years, the amount of space let by landlords to serviced office providers in Dublin increased from 1,072 square metres in 2015 to 17,503 square metres last year.
Even more dramatically, the serviced office market share has increased from 0.4 to 20 per cent of office take-up in the first quarter of this year.

Company: Enterpryze  Solutions
Done Deal: UOB contract
The clincher: “Banks all over the world will be looking at this move by one of the biggest players in the industry to support their customers” – Morgan Browne, chief executive,  Enterpryze Solutions
Software start-up Enterpryze Solutions is headed for revenues of €12 million this year on foot of a major international deal with United Overseas Bank (UOB) in Singapore.
Under the contract, software developed by the Dublin company will be made available to up to 20,000 UOB customers over two years.
UOB will make the Enterpryze platform available to its business customers as part of an initiative it is launching to help them enhance their digital capability.
UOB plans to invest €4 million annually in the BizSmart project, which will see the Enterpryze platform offered at a discounted rate to the bank’s business customers in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.
As one of two partners selected for the project, Enterpryze will handle invoicing, inventory management and expenses.
A separate payroll system will be handled by Singapore-based Hreasily.
Enterpryze is a spin-out of Milner Browne, the Irish-owned company established in 2003 to implement business management software by SAP.
Its mobile platform has been developed for the German multinational’s SME product SAP Business One. The SAP-partnered solution was launched in 2016 and is aimed at SMEs and sole traders.
The platform has several business management applications. These include service and delivery; expenses; purchasing; sales; timesheets; and credit control.
Commenting on the UOB deal, Enterpryze chief executive Morgan Browne said: “This is a very big moment for Enterpryze. Having launched less than a year and a half ago, it is a global validation of our solution.
“It opens us up to a market of 40,000 companies and 200,000 users by the end of 2019, which in its own right is a huge opportunity for the business, but it’s also what will flow from this thanks to the global recognition the partnership will give Enterpryze.
“Banks all over the world will be looking at this move by one of the biggest players in the industry to support their customers.”
Enterpryze announced plans to create 200 jobs over three years in late 2016, having secured €3 million in private investment.
Prior to that funding round, Milner Browne invested €3 million in the development of the Enterpryze platform over two-and-a-half years, with support from Enterprise Ireland.
Enterpryze Solutions is now working with 30 banks globally in partnership with SAP, having gone live in seven countries in east Africa last August.
“As small businesses implement digital solutions to reap the benefits of technology, it is important that they use a solution that has the ability to grow with their business without the need for further significant investments,” said Lawrence Loh, managing director and head of group business banking at UOB.
“As such, we are working with Enterpryze to offer UOB BizSmart, a suite of cloud-based business applications, to enable small businesses to manage business processes such as payroll, invoicing and inventory management more efficiently and cost-effectively.”

Edwardian residence in Limerick is a beguiling blend of old and new

Body


The Edwardian-era homes on Limerick’s Ennis Road speak to the wealth of the middle classes living in the surrounds of the city a century ago. Among the most substantial period properties on this still much sought after street is Springdale, a detached house set well back from the thoroughfare behind a stone wall with electric gates.
The two-bay, two-storey residence was built in 1910 by William Clifford Smith, the English architect best known for designing the distinctive Shannon Rowing Club on nearby Sarsfield Bridge, as well as Adare Town Hall.
Newly on the market for €1.2 million through DNG Cusack Dunne, Springdale today blends modern and period features across two levels of accommodation, as well as offering 0.6 of an acre of gardens to the front and back. It was last sold in 2011 for €750,000, according to the Property Price Register.
The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage describes it as displaying English Revival features “typical of the domestic suburban architecture in Limerick at the time”, with alterations that manage not to detract from its “architectural significance”.
The house is approached by a tree-lined driveway leading to parking space and an open porch.
Double front doors with stained glass panels open into a wide entrance hall with parquet flooring, wainscoted walls and ceilings, picture rails and an original timber and cast-iron fireplace. The ceiling extends to double height over the staircase.
Off the hallway is a drawing room that overlooks the front lawns through a large bay window and interconnects with another reception room, which in turn has a door leading out to the front gardens. Both have timber floors, fireplaces, dual-aspect windows, tall ceilings and picture rails. A parquet-floored study with a fireplace and feature window provides a smaller space, as does another reception room with period features.
The more contemporary kitchen/dining/living area was added to the house around 30 years ago, according to the agent. Velux windows ensure plenty of light in this extended open-plan room, which has access to a patio at the side of the house, as well as gardens to the rear.
The split-level kitchen is fitted with a four-door cooker and painted timber in-frame units with a coordinating breakfast peninsula and dresser, while the seating area is centred around a solid fuel stove. A separate fitted utility room is plumbed for a washing machine and dryer, and also has a door out to the gardens. The downstairs accommodation is completed by a tiled WC.
The period ceiling details and picture rails continue upstairs in the landing, which is well lit by a wide window over the staircase. There are three bedrooms upstairs, including a master suite covering what was previously two bedrooms. The carpeted, dual aspect master bedroom has coving, an original fireplace, a dressing-room with Shaker-style built-in wardrobes and a tiled, contemporary en suite shower room. The two other bedrooms are double-sized and also have period fireplaces. The family bathroom is timber floored and fitted with a free-standing cast-iron bath and a separate shower.
Outside is a garage and several outhouses, along with a large lawn circled by mature trees, shrubs and a garden path. Springdale is a few minutes’ stroll from Limerick city centre, University Maternity Hospital Limerick, Thomond Park and Limerick Lawn Tennis Club. Limerick train station, with regular services to Dublin and Galway, is about a 20-minute walk away, and the nearby M7 also provides a direct link to the capital.
The University of Limerick campus is just over five kilometres away, while a 25-minute drive gets you to Shannon Airport. Other local amenities include Adare Manor Golf Club and the walking trails at Woodcock Hill.

Body


Buyers within the horsey set who are on the hunt for the bucolic charm of a well-presented period home accompanied by rolling paddocks, a stabling barn and close to both Kilcock and Maynooth, should consider Ballykeelan House in Donadea in north Co Kildare.
The early Victorian residence sits on six acres of well-tended and mature grounds. It has been completely refurbished, extended and modernised to offer 345 square metres of contemporary living space, and is on the market with joint Co Kildare agents Sherry FitzGerald Brady O’Flaherty and CME, guiding €1.2 million.
The current owners have brought the mature country house into the 21st century, sensitively and seamlessly combining existing period features with mod cons, topped off by a respectable B3 energy rating. Wrought iron gates open onto a long gravel driveway bound by mature hedges and specimen trees, which culminate in a generous gravelled area at the front of the house.
A modest period front door with a slim window overhead opens to a wide and welcoming entrance hall with solid oak floors, original coving and a centre rose, and dado rails.
An original reception room to the left is still used as a formal drawing room. The same oak floors continue into this space, which has two generous sash windows with fitted white roll-blinds and which overlook the front of the property. Retaining typical period features of high coved and corniced ceilings, the room has flocked coral wallpaper and an open fire with a wide mahogany surround and a slate and tiled hearth and inset.
Double timber-framed glass doors at the rear of the entrance hall open to a spacious and bright inner hall with the same oak floors and a feature, hand-carved staircase, a guest WC and understairs storage. A second set of doors opens to the open-plan, double-height kitchen/dining and living room, the heart of Ballykeelan House, and a triple aspect space filled with natural light and charm.
The country-style kitchen area has an extensive range of Shaker-style cream base and all-mounted units with granite worktops and upstands, pale cream splashback tiles, slate floor tiles and an oil-fired cream Aga. The space has a full complement of integrated appliances, including an electric oven for the summer months.
A rear hall off the kitchen leads to a plumbed utility room with a large Belfast sink and fitted shelving, an adjacent guest WC with a tiled floor and access to the courtyard. Opposite the kitchen area is an expansive living-room area with solid American oak floors and a vaulted ceiling with exposed beams. A focal point of the room is an impressive carved York sandstone fireplace, which envelops a wood-burning stove and which is flanked by two tall, arched sash windows overlooking the side gardens of the house.
[caption id="attachment_417880" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] An outdoor seating area at Ballykeelan House in Co Kildare[/caption]
One set of French doors leads directly out to the gardens, while a second set of timber-framed glass double doors opens to the family/garden room at the rear. The mezzanine gallery space overlooks this end of the open-plan room.
Seeped in natural light, which streams in through wall-to-wall windows at one end and a series of tall sash windows, the dual aspect, south-facing family room has solid oak floors, a generous seating and dining area, matching brass chandeliers, garden access and a cosy solid fuel stove.
Upstairs, there are four large first-floor bedrooms, three of which have en suites, and the main family bathroom.
Two of the bedrooms overlook the front of the property, one has access to the family bathroom set between the rooms. The other is a dual-aspect room with an original fireplace and carpeted floors. The family bathroom has both a bath and a separate shower, tiled floors and wet areas, and partial wainscoting in deep cream.
The dual aspect master bedroom overlooks the rear gardens and paddocks. The room has cream carpets, sash windows and a large walk-in wardrobe and a Jack & Jill door to its en suite.
The fourth bedroom, which overlooks the side of the house, also shares access to the master en suite.
The residence also incorporates a self-contained one-bedroom annex at ground-floor level which includes a kitchenette, a living room with a stove, a bathroom and access from the rear patio. The space would be ideal for perhaps an elderly family member or an au pair.
It should be noted that all carpets, curtains, blinds and kitchen appliances are included in the sale.
Outside, the house is surrounded by extensive mature lawned gardens interspersed with well-stocked, colourful flower beds and shrubs. There’s a generous, south-facing Indian stone paved patio area with views of the countryside and multiple access points from the rear of the house. Beyond that are an expansive courtyard with ample parking and a 232 square metre American barn with provision for stabling.
The grounds also include a herb garden, a mature orchard and four fenced paddocks, all located less than a ten-minute drive from Kilcock and the M4 motorway.
The 650-acre Donadea Forest Park is close by, Clongowes Wood College is less than ten minutes’ drive, Dublin City and airport are about 40 minutes away and the area is home to some of the country’s busiest and best known racecourses: Punchestown, Naas, Fairyhouse and the Curragh.

In the latest phase of her long career in fashion, Mayo-born entrepreneur Ann Marie McDonagh launched online boutique Serenity & Grace in London in 2016.
A former model, McDonagh set up the business having been global commercial director for British menswear brand Fred Perry and head of merchandising for both Gant UK and Ghost.
“I’d worked for fashion brands for more than 25 years. Before Ghost, I worked with Monsoon and Fenn Wright Manson and I understood the importance of occasionwear,” said McDonagh.
“That said, when I worked for Gant during the recession, I witnessed the pull-back on occasionwear.
“There was a shift to conservative dressing and that left a gap in the market that, I think, still hasn’t been filled.”
Serenity & Grace specialises in womenswear for special occasions, such as weddings and family occasions, race days, black tie events and graduations.
The site also stocks tops, skirts, trousers, coats, jewellery, lingerie and childrenswear for girls and boys. Prices range from £30 (€34) to £500 (€571).According to McDonagh, Serenity & Grace has 4,000 customers a week, including 60 per cent from Britain and more than 20 per cent from Ireland.
“We’ve really focused on Irish brands, so we have Marc Angelo, Fee G and Jennifer Rothwell. We have Pia Rossini accessories and Absolute Jewellery,” she said.
“We sell So Amazing clothes under Serenity by Serenity & Grace and we also have Special Day and 1880 Club boyswear.
“I could have chosen an easy route straight through British brands and new international brands but I want to make a difference for Irish fashion and help designers and labels in Ireland sell internationally.”
In the past year, Serenity & Grace has secured partnerships with British Airways, the National Film Awards and the National Reality TV Awards in Britain.
McDonagh has now launched a fundraising campaign on Irish crowdfunding site Sparkcrowdfunding.com and will open a Serenity & Grace concession at House of Fraser’s flagship Oxford Street store in London later this month.
“We want to raise €50,000 at a pre-money valuation of €300,000,” she said. “We’re raising funds for the first time to accelerate our growth in British and other international markets.
“We’ve got to a stage now where we can achieve accelerated growth online by increasing our digital marketing expenditure and it is for this reason that we are raising funds.
“The beauty of this business is that our data analytics allow us track the return on investment of every cent we spend on online marketing, so we can be incredibly effective with our online budget.”

Founder of Vroom Digital on a journey towards expansion

Highlight: From Trinity student to Mater Hospital care assistant, Shane Curtin has taken a roundabout route to his current role – and it’s made him extra motivated to turn his company into a roaring success 
Body


Irish businesses are still struggling to get their heads around the point of online advertising, but Vroom Digital is betting it can steer them in the right direction.
The business is creating 15 new jobs over the next two years, bringing its total staff number to 25, as part of a €750,000 investment.
“We hitched our cart to Google three years ago. Google has a premier partner programme. We built our team around the offering they had and that has helped us bring in clients. We’ve delivered better results,” Shane Curtin, managing director of Vroom Digital, told The Sunday Business Post.
“We’ve been around for six years now. When you go in to pitch for business, it’s a different story to year one or two. We have the client list and the bigger brands now.
“The new roles are to help us scale up and go after bigger clients that we know we can look after. We’re doing a lot of work with Irish clients that are exporting.”
The business specialises in work on pay-per-click, search engine optimisation (SEO) and conversion rate optimisation. Vroom’s clients cover a broad base of sectors, and include Phone Watch and Weir & Sons jewellers.
The challenge Curtin sees at present in the sector is helping companies to understand what’s not working more than finding what will work.
“You kind of have to be a bit like a doctor – diagnose the problem before treating it. We’d do video analysis, then develop a proposal for the client, look at the data and see what works rather than trying to solve 20 things at once,” he said.
“A lot of people come to us and they haven’t even got tracking on their site properly. We’re very much data-driven. The data leads the argument because it tells you what went on and what to do going forward.”
On the whole, Curtin has found that clients coming to him now are more informed than in 2012, but there’s still work required.
He said: “It’s improved but SMEs are quite unrealistic in their expectations. They might come to us looking to spend a small amount and they don’t really understand that, a lot of the time, it’s the website that’s letting them down.
“The first thing we’d look at is the website. We’d often say to somebody in a pitch that the website should be the best salesperson. If you wouldn’t put someone out in a shoddy suit, why would you have a shoddy site?”
Curtin said this was particularly relevant when it came to working out the elements of campaigns as, he explained, businesses often don’t understand the mix required.
“We get it all the time where people say they don’t want to try one thing because they see it as a waste of money,” he said.
“If you stop filling up a funnel, you get nothing out the bottom in a while. A lot of what we do is education around what we’ve learned.”
The data-driven nature of Curtin’s business has meant it is naturally affected by the newly-arrived general data protection regulation (GDPR). He sees it as a potentially massive headache for smaller firms.
“My inbox has gone very quiet since May 25. I’m very happy. For SMEs, it’s huge. If you’ve got 5,000 email subscribers, your list could be annihilated,” he said.
“It’s tough, but it’s a good thing for the industry. It cleans up the crap coming into your inbox.
“Anything that pushes the market forward is a good thing. If it makes the landscape better, marketers are all for it.”
Curtin took a rather roundabout route to setting up Vroom. Working for a year as a care assistant in the Mater Hospital after finishing studying in Trinity, the Laois native did a crash course in sales before working in publishing and eventually digital marketing.
He said: “I kind of didn’t know what I wanted to do after college. Then I figured I’d better start using my degree.
“Before I set up Vroom, I worked for a company called Just Search. I trained in Manchester and opened their office in Dublin. Two years later, I moved on and started Vroom. Before that, I hadn’t a clue what SEO or pay-per-click was.”
As the firm looks to grow, Curtin said he was finding the market challenging in terms of finding suitable people for roles.
“It’s so hard to compete. We’re competing against LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google and the like. Everybody wants to work in those big glass boxes,” he said.
“We’re looking for senior people, and it’s hard to find the level of person we’re looking for. We spent five months looking for our conversion rate optimiser.
“To find the right person takes time in the Irish market. We’re using three different recruitment agencies and it’s been really tough the last couple of weeks: we’ve not got everyone we’ve wanted, for a variety of factors.”

Company: Neurent Medical
Done Deal: €9.3m funding
The clincher: “This investment will ultimately get our technology into the hands of ear, nose and throat surgeons” - Brian Shields, chief executive, Neurent Medical
Neurent Medical, the Galway-based medical company developing a device to treat a common nasal inflammation, has raised €9.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Fountain Healthcare Partners.
Neurent will use the funding to commercialise its device for treating rhinitis in the US market, advancing product development, carrying out clinical trials and hiring up to 25 people.
“This investment will help us to advance our product development and ultimately get our technology in the hands of ear, nose and throat surgeons,” said Brian Shields, chief executive, Neurent Medical.
Shields established Neurent in 2015 with co-founder David Townley. The pair met through NUI Galway’s BioInnovate Ireland Programme.
During the clinical immersion phase of the programme, they spent time with clinicians in ear, nose and throat clinics nationally and internationally, including one run by NUI Galway professor Ivan Keogh.
Having developed an early version of their device in response to their BioInnovate experience, Shields and Townley worked with Keogh, other NUI Galway teaching staff and the university’s Translational Medical Device Lab, to validate the concept.
According to Shields, rhinitis is thought to affect up to 40 per cent of the population, with 25 per cent suffering from allergic rhinitis and 15 per cent from non-allergic rhinitis.
It is the fifth most common chronic disease in the US and the most common chronic disease in children overall.
The device Neurent is developing will give ear, nose and throat surgeons a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with rhinitis.
“It will mean they can alleviate the two primary symptoms of rhinitis, rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction, without surgery and using only local anaesthesia,” said Shields.
In addition to Fountain Healthcare Partners, other participants in Neurent’s €9.3 million funding round include Atlantic Bridge Capital, the Western Development Commission, Enterprise Ireland and a syndicate of Irish and US Medical Device veterans.
“We are excited that our latest investment provides an opportunity to expand our internal teams working across both primary and applied research,” said Townley, who is Neurent’s chief technology officer.
“This is important to inform the company’s technology and product development and deepen our collaborations with leading experts to advance our treatment of rhinitis.”

Company: Health Care Informed
Done Deal: Medical Council contract
The clincher: ““We are delighted to be working with the Medical Council to develop a set of world-class standards that can support effective and beneficial training for doctors,” – John Sweeney, chief executive, HCI
Galway company Health Care Informed (HCI) is expected to have revenues of about €3 million for the current financial year having secured a 12-month contract with the Medical Council, the privately-funded regulatory body for doctors practising in Ireland.
Under the terms of the contract, HCI will develop best practice standards designed to smooth the transition between the various stages of a doctor’s professional development and training.
More than 21,000 doctors in the Republic are registered with the Medical Council. HCI will work with the council to develop a single coherent set of standards for the management and delivery of education and training at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
“We are delighted to harness HCI’s international expertise as we aim to create a supportive learning environment to enable good professional practice,” said Una O’Rourke, Medical Council director for education, training and professionalism.
“This includes incorporating international best practice to ensure accreditation activity is of the highest standard and meets the changing needs of the medical profession.”
HCI specialises in patient safety and quality improvement support services for health and social care organisations. Established in 2005, the company employs 30 people in Galway and Dublin.
“We are delighted to be working with the Medical Council to develop a set of world-class standards that can support effective and beneficial training for doctors,” said HCI chief executive John Sweeney.
“We will work with the Medical Council to ensure they can provide a supportive learning environment to enable good professional practice.”
HCI provides regulatory, accreditation, risk-management and quality improvement services to hospitals, nursing homes and people working in disability and social care settings.
The company was appointed adviser to the Supreme Council of Health in Qatar in 2015, offering guidance on the development of a national healthcare licensing and accreditation system to regulate the country’s health and social care services.
The contract followed a similar arrangement, agreed earlier that year, in which the Galway company was appointed to act as technical adviser to Brazilian healthcare body Organização Nacional de Acreditação (ONA).
HCI’s software partners are Ideagen and VCare International. Its clients in Ireland include Tusla, the Mental Health Commission, UL Hospitals Group and Ireland East Hospital Group.

Helping the not-for-profit sector to help others

Highlight: Deloitte’s broad experience means it is ideally placed to help the not-for-profit sector navigate the transition to the Charities Statement of Recommended Practice, writes Arlene Harris 
Body


Deloitte is a leading adviser to the not-for-profit sector in Ireland. Every day the firm rises to the challenge of doing what matters most – for clients, for staff and for society.
Marguarita Martin, head of not-for-profit (NFP) within the organisation, believes its broad experience across the sector is what sets it apart.
“From international NGOs to large national hospitals, social housing providers, representative bodies and trusts – we provide a multidisciplinary approach across audit and assurance, risk advisory, tax, financial advisory and consulting,” she said.
“This ensures our clients have access to professionals with the right expertise and experience. We are committed to joining Irish NFPs on their journey to make a positive and tangible impact for their service users.
“Over the past year, we have assisted our clients within the sector with transitions to the Charities Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP), provision of advice and guidance on improving annual reporting to make an impact.
“We have also provided corporate governance reviews, assisted with GDPR readiness programmes, and worked with our clients to provide sector-specific tax advice as well as completing many external-audit and internal-audit engagements.”
And with all the new regulations in place, Martin said there were many challenges facing the sector over the next 12 months.
“One of the major challenges for fundraisers is GDPR which came into effect on May 25,” she said.
“This marks a significant change in previous data protection laws in Ireland and NFP organisations continue to face challenges for full compliance to gather, store and use service users’ and donors’ personal information.
“In addition, technological changes such as online fundraising platforms and donation apps are already having a dramatic impact on how charities fundraise and the way people choose to give and support causes they care about. Furthermore, challenges in maintaining appropriate levels of funding to provide services as well as covering general administration costs continue to be significant issues for many parts of the sector.”
And maintaining a good reputation is also a key challenge for the sector.
“Negative press publicity may impact fundraising initiatives and the sector needs to continue to uphold the principle of transparency by publishing high-quality, clear information including the outcome of any negative issues they encountered, in their directors’ or trustees’ report and on their website,” advised Martin.
“While the sector must focus on and celebrate successes, it is equally as important to spend time measuring ourselves against the targets we set in our strategic plans.”
The main advantage of Irish NFP organisations using an integrated audit and tax offering is twofold - expertise and efficiency - and Marguarita Martin said Deloitte has every aspect covered.
“Deloitte Ireland’s multidisciplinary capability to serve the NFP sector ensures all our people have a deep insight to the issues and challenges which arise and we have the required specialists on the team to address our clients’ needs,” she said
“Whether dealing with a Vat issue or due diligence for a potential combination between NFP entities, our team of specialists is on hand to provide sector-specific advice and guidance.
“In addition, utilising a single professional service provider ensures the right people can be mobilised quickly and our integrated teams can provide an efficient sector-specific response.”
The reporting requirements for NFP organisations in Ireland is dependent on the structure of the entity and directors of all NFP organisations which are incorporated as a limited company, designated activity company, or company limited by guarantee are required under company law to prepare financial statements for the company in respect of each financial year which give a “true and fair view”.
NFP organisations which are not incorporated under Irish company law are not required to follow the Companies Act 2014, but do need to comply with their governing instrument (ie a trust deed, rule book or constitution).
“Best practice reporting in Ireland for NFP entities is considered to be the Charities SORP, although it is not yet mandatory,” said Martin.
“While there are significant technical accounting differences between standard Irish reporting requirements and the Charities SORP, more and more Irish NFPs have either adopted the Charities SORP or are preparing for transition in their annual reports and financial statements.
“The Charities SORP requires transparency and balance in not-for-profit entities’ annual reports and financial statements. This provides an opportunity for Irish NFPs to promote, advertise and celebrate their achievements. At Deloitte, we believe now is the time for Irish charities to take the lead in this regard, to tell their story and find their own annual reporting style, consistent with the framework of the Charities SORP.”

How to make retirement work for everybody
Sunday Business Post

Length: 802 words
Byline: Melanie Crowley
Highlight: Economic and other factors mean that many people want to work past traditional retirement age. Here’s what employers can do to make both staying and leaving as effortless as possible 
Body


A changing age demographic, economic necessity, the pension pay gap and changes to the state pension age have meant that many people will want to continue working past the traditional retirement age of 65.
The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) has, in consultation with various interest groups, prepared a Code of Practice, setting out best practice for employers on how to engage with employees in the run-up to retirement age.
The code provides guidance to employers on maximising the skills and experience of older employees, objectively justifying retirement and retirement arrangements.
It also provides guidance on managing requests to work beyond retirement age and maximising the skills and experience of older employees.
Examples of measures that can be taken by employers to maximise the skills and experience of older employees include training management on age diversity and its benefits, and encouraging the sharing of knowledge and experience to utilise the skill and experience of employees of all ages.
Additional measures include ensuring that age bias does not exist in policies and procedures, fostering a culture that appreciates the need for training and development for employees of all ages and objectively justifying retirement.
From a legal perspective, the setting of mandatory retirement ages will not constitute age discrimination once it can be objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.
The code provides guidance in relation to the types of factors that might constitute a legitimate aim, such as:
- intergenerational fairness;
- motivation of employees by providing increased prospects of promotion;
- health and safety;
- creation of a balanced workforce in terms of age;
- personal and professional dignity, and;
- succession planning.
In addition, an employer can offer a fixed-term contract to an employee who has reached mandatory retirement age.
This will not constitute age discrimination if the giving of a fixed-term contract is objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are proportionate and necessary.
The code sets out guidance for employers on how to approach retirement arrangements with employees.
This can include opening a dialogue with individual employees on their plans around retirement, particularly where no contractual retirement age exists, so that there is a clear understanding between the parties.
It could also include providing supports such as pre-retirement courses, flexible working arrangements and/or counselling to facilitate the transition to retirement, and providing clear information to employees on retirement procedures, both at recruitment stage and at regular intervals during employment.
The code indicates that, in order to facilitate planning on both sides, it is good practice for an employer to notify an employee in writing of its intention to enforce a contractual retirement age, where one exists, six to 12 months in advance of the date.
The code recommends that this initial written notification be followed up with a face-to-face consultation.
The code states that requests to work beyond a contractual retirement age should be considered carefully by employers and that the following issues be considered by the employer:
- grounds on which the request should be accepted or refused;
- the factors that are impersonal to the employee;
- the contractual form any extensions might take; and
- whether flexible working arrangements are more appropriate in the circumstances.
The code also sets out a recommended procedure for dealing with requests to work beyond a contractual retirement age, which can be summarised as follows:
- requests should be made in writing at least three months in advance of the retirement date;
- an individual consultation meeting should follow the written request;
- the employer’s decision should be communicated in writing to the employee as soon as reasonably practicable following the consultation meeting.
If the decision is to grant the request, it should be clearly stated in the decision letter that the decision is based solely on the individual case made by the employee. It must state that the decision does not have universal effect. This is to minimise the risk of other employees seeking to rely on an implied contractual right to work beyond retirement age on the basis of custom and practice.
If the decision is to refuse the request, the decision should be communicated to the employee in a meeting, at which the employee may be accompanied by a witness or representative. Emphasis should be placed on factors that are impersonal to the employee. The employee should also have access to an appeals procedure.

Boys + Girls invests in The Bot Platform
Dublin-based creative agency Boys + Girls has invested in communications tool The Bot Platform. The platform allows agencies and businesses to build bots, which are automated communications, on Messenger and Workplace by Facebook. Companies including BBC, Sony Music, Red Bull, Samsung, and Johnson & Johnson use The Bot Platform to communicate with large audiences. Patrick Meade, partner and managing director of Boys + Girls, said it was virtually impossible for a successful creative and marketing programme not to feature bots as an essential component.
Syd Lawrence, a co-founder of The Bot Platform which was founded in Britain in 2017, said: “As self-professed pioneers in automation and the future of communications, we’re delighted that Boys + Girls have come on board as both an investor and as our Irish agency partner, offering access to The Bot Platform for their clients.”

Publicis London has been re-appointed by Tourism Ireland to develop its global creative work, while OMD has been appointed as its global media agency. The appointments follow a statutory requirement to re-tender for the services every seven years. Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing the island of Ireland as a holiday destination to a global audience.
Nick Farnhill, chief executive of Publicis London and POKE, said: “We’re thrilled to have been awarded the opportunity to continue working together and showcase all that the island of Ireland has to offer and bring even more new visitors to this exceptional country.”
Guy Marks, chief executive of OMD EMEA, said of the appointment: “Ireland is a vibrant, exciting and cultural destination, and tourism is an incredibly important sector with 10.65 million visitors each year spending around €5.78 billion. We are delighted to be working with Tourism Ireland in partnership with Publicis London to deliver next-generation communications.”
Meanwhile, Wilson Hartnell has appointed Oisin Langan as account director in its sports marketing and sponsorship practice.
Langan spent over a decade as a sports broadcaster with Off The Ball and Newstalk’s breakfast programmes before leaving the media company to take up the role at Wilson Hartnell. In his new role, he will lead on strategy and content development across a number of leading Irish and international brands.
Newspapers are trusted more than other media channels, according to a new study from NewsBrands Ireland, the industry body which represents Ireland’s national newspapers.
The survey, which was conducted by international research company Research & Analysis of Media, found 45 per cent of people ranked newspapers as having the most trustworthy news content compared with TV (22 per cent), radio (15 per cent), internet (13 per cent), and social media (3 per cent).
Of the 1,300 respondents to the study, more than half (56 per cent) said that information from newspaper titles was more reliable than from other media channels, while nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) believed that newspapers were the most trustworthy source for news.
In addition, newspapers were found to be one of the least intrusive media outlets for seeing advertisements. Some 20 per cent of respondents said that they found newspaper advertising to be intrusive compared to 66 per cent of respondents who said that they found advertising on social media to be intrusive. The research was launched at NewsBrands Ireland’s reAction event last Thursday. NewsBrands chief executive Ann Marie Lenihan said: “The RAM study confirms what our industry has known for some time – that newsbrands are an action media. The report is intended to help marketers and agencies determine their media choices by responses to advertising, and not simply by audience numbers.”

Is this a rent subsidy I see before me?

Highlight: Paddy Cosgrave indulged his Shakespearean side last week, but his decision to subsidise rents for some of his employees could have a knock-on effect for the rental market 
Body


Paddy Cosgrave fancies himself as a new Mark Antony, if his remarks in Dublin last week are anything to go by.
At the announcement of Web Summit’s last batch of new jobs, 50 announced across eight locations, Cosgrave opted for flip-flops instead of sandals, and it was a high chair rather than standing before the body of Caesar.
Still, he was clearly going to the Shakespearean playbook with his approach regarding his quietened corruption campaign. He made mention of the many people of influence and power who came to him in the hours and days afterwards to inform him of how there is no corruption in Ireland. All he was short of doing was crying out that they were all honourable men to hammer the lack of subtlety home.
It’s become the norm at Cosgrave’s announcements in recent years - even since his triumvirate split with Daire Hickey going off to pursue other ventures - where he lists off the assorted top-line items around jobs and expansion before taking the opportunity to discuss his cause du jour.
The top-line items had a lovely spread to them this time, the type of global look that is easy to present well because it points to more future growth. A pair of new offices in Toronto and Hong Kong, along with jobs going to other spots like Berlin and Dusseldorf. Then there’s the small matter of locking in his Collision conference with Toronto for three years, a similar deal with the one made in Lisbon for Web Summit.
As for the flagship event, despite it being just over five months away, the home for it going forward remains up in the air. Cosgrave was open about meetings in other European cities, pointing out London and Paris in particular, but was clear that he didn’t have a timeline on when he’d be announcing what would happen after this November’s event in Lisbon.
Dublin’s position is a touch more secure. There’s no deal, but the numbers registered by having MoneyConf here rather than Madrid later this month seem to have made Cosgrave happy to stick around for the foreseeable future.
The top-line stuff is working well for Cosgrave, given the deals he’s made in recent months. It’s where his causes come in that things get a tad more complicated. It’s seeing those causes actually get anywhere that seems problematic, although the move for Web Summit staff around housing certainly seems focused in the right place.
Anyone within a two-kilometre radius of the firm’s office in Dartry will receive rent and mortgage support in the range of €800 to €1,200 annually to offset the cost in Dublin.
It’s a localised gesture towards his own workforce, and one being recognised by the broader tech sector. But the natural knock-on problem with this is that it could add to the already steep rent issues in the capital and elsewhere.
Cosgrave’s business, particularly when it comes to staff numbers, isn’t a dial-mover on rent. But for a Google or a Facebook, such an action has to be seriously on the agenda. Living and sleeping in Ireland are becoming prohibitively expensive. The tech sector, however, is still trying to get bodies here. Going by the way multinationals usually address issues, it’s going to lead to a clear leg-up for staff with such supports, but also an issue for those without.
If large employers roll out subsidies, landlords are going to raise rents. Those without subsidies will come under more pressure. Cosgrave is within his rights to look after his own, but it’s also a warning sign that bigger moves in such a manner could hit the rental market even harder.
Of course, we may see the even more radical move - one that is beyond the means of Cosgrave’s business right now - of employers building their own houses for staff. It wouldn’t be the first time such a move happened in this state.
As for the corruption campaign, Cosgrave kept saying he hoped that those telling him there is no corruption in Ireland were right, but also to wait for two weeks when his MoneyConf event is at the RDS in Dublin.
Mischief, thou art afoot. Take thou what course thou wilt.

Landscapes and Luftwaffe raids lead de Vere’s latest sale

Highlight: Sharply contrasting works by Paul Henry and Colin Middleton are sure to drum up plenty of interest 
Body


Surrealism leads at de Vere’s sale next week with Paysage des Rêves Mauvais, Colin Middleton’s prescient fantasy nightmare, 46×61cm (€50,000-€70,000). From the collection of George and Maura McClelland, it dates from 1940 when Germany had invaded France, prompting fears that Belfast could be the next Luftwaffe target. The following April, four bombing raids devastated the city.
Paul Henry’s love affair with the Irish landscape was lifelong. A Road in Connemara, probably painted towards the end of his career, has all the key elements of Ireland’s archetypal rural lifestyle: the thatched cottage dwarfed by the glowering mountain, the peat stack, and skies such as only Henry could paint. It’s a small work, 25.5×32cm, but as so often with Henry, its intimate size gives it a magical quality (€40,000-€60,000).
[caption id="attachment_417814" align="alignright" width="329"] Click by Rowan Gillespie (€20,000-€30,000)[/caption]
Interpreted by the right eye, magic can also be conjured up in an image of the most mundane streetscape. A superb example is John & Denis Mangan’s Shop, Killorglin, Co Kerry by photorealist John Doherty, 108.8×179cm (€30,000-€50,000).
An abstract highlight is William Scott’s monumental Painting 1959, 212×135cm (€25,000 -€35,000). Through the 1950s, Scott’s focus had been abstract still lifes but, towards the end of the decade, the pots and pans had given way to full abstraction where the impact depends on his masterly use of paint. Scott often used paint sparingly, but here it is packed on with dynamic strength and confidence.
Coming down in price, the sale also offers a Scott lithograph of those familiar kitchen implements, Still Life With Pan, 67×88cm (€3,000-€5,000). Other notable abstracts are William’s Crozier’s Roaring Water Bay, 51×61cm (€8,000-€12,000), and John Shinnors’ diptych Scottish Kites, Banna Strand, in his signature red white and black, each 52×29.5cm (€10,000-€15,000).
A tribute? Or a poke in the eye? In the case of Daniel O’Neill’s Portrait of a Poet, that’s for the viewer to decide, 49×71cm (€8,000-€12,000).
Affordable highlights include three coastal scenes: Mary Lohan’s seascape diptych, each 46×46cm (€1,500-€2,500), George Russell’s playful In the Sand Dunes, 40.5×51cm (€2,000-€4,000), and a watercolour by Jack B Yeats, Near Ballycastle, Co Mayo, 24×33cm (€3,000-€5,000).
A strong sculpture section kicks off with Rowan Gillespie’s Click, a depiction in bronze of an elongated female figure , 112cm high (€20,000-€30,000). It was inspired by a visit to a Dún Laoghaire festival in 2003, where he observed a graceful dancer weaving her way round the stage, clicking her fingers – hence the title.
A second headline bronze sculpture is Patrick O’Reilly’s four-foot-tall Marching Bear (€25,000-€30,000). O’Reilly’s talent for whimsy can also be seen in his 1,250cm galvanised steel and larch wood Pitchfork (€4,000-€6,000).
Anyone who has ever counted a horse as a pal will instantly recognise what’s going on in the head of Anthony Scott’s endearing bronze, Etain 6, 46×51cm  (€6,000-€9,000).
A few of the larger sculptures will be on view in a south Dublin garden – by appointment only, call 01-6768300.

In a city full of tourist spots, it can be hard to stand out, so David O’Connor, head of sales and marketing at new Dublin tourism attraction The Vaults, has been thinking outside the box.
“There’s talk of a few branded Vespas with Bram Stoker and a Viking flying around town on them,” he said. “Something different to create a stir and get us noticed.”
Located in the old Augustinian St John’s National School in the Liberties, the Vaults is a live theatrical attraction inspired by Irish history.
“It is situated in an old school. The building has been gutted on the inside, and we have refurbished it to include a modern lobby area. The show takes place over the four floors of the building,” O’Connor said.
The various scenes in the show will depict different parts of Irish history, including life after Cromwell, Viking rule, Bram Stoker and Molly Malone. The live performances will include special effects, dark humour, lighter moments and lots of audience participation.
“It is historically accurate. It is all based on real things in Irish history, but they put their own spin on it. It is not a museum. It is not a history lesson. But you will come out of it knowing something about Irish history that you didn’t know before you went in.”
The Vaults is privately owned by broadcaster and entrepreneur Paul Blanchfield and producer Gerald Heffernan. They funded the €5 million project, with some other private investors and some cash from Fáilte Ireland. Some 50 jobs have been created by the company, including 28 actors and 22 front-of-house, food and beverage, retail sales and merchandising assistants, technical specialists, make-up and wardrobe.
The attraction will open at the end of June, although it will undergo several dry runs to ensure the experience is perfect before it is open to the public.
“We finished casting the actors last month,” said O’Connor. “Offers to the actors have gone out. We are waiting on confirmation from them, and then we will be good to go for rehearsals.”
The Vaults is targeting 130,000 visitors in its first year. If it hits that target, it will break even in year one. O’Connor said its target for year two was 180,000 visitors. Its target market was broad, he said, as it is open for everyone regardless of age.
“Research has shown that the Vaults is the kind of activity millennials are looking for,” he said. “It is so diverse that families are a huge target as well, because it is for all of the family.”
It will be targeted at tourists coming to Dublin from overseas as well as from across Ireland.
O’Connor has planned an extensive marketing campaign encompassing traditional and digital media. He will run a radio campaign across Dublin and national stations and several outdoor adverts across Dublin for two months including billboards, buses, the Aircoach and so on.
It will invest €30,000 in the radio campaign. It is investing more than that in digital on adwords, social media, and display advertising. Casting and auditions were filmed and those clips will be used to promote the Vaults.
It will do partnerships with other tourism companies like open-top buses and its brochures will be available at the airport and in hotel lobbies, O’Connor said. It will also run some on-street activation.
“I’m looking at a few different options for some on-street activity that would cause a scene,” he said - hence the idea of Bram Stoker on a Vespa.
With the millennial market in mind, the Vaults has been designed to include many photo opportunities.
“We are targeting people who are always on their phones,” he said. “The Vaults does lend itself to shareable content. Even the retail section at the end of the show, we call it our seventh scene because of the detail that has gone into it. It is based on an old-style Parisian café and it is highly detailed, so there are even photo opportunities in there.”

HBAN launches new London syndicate
The Halo Business Angel Network (HBAN) has announced that its new London syndicate will invest €3 million in Irish start-ups over three years.
HBAN partnered with New York’s Digital Irish Angels (DIA) syndicate earlier this year, making the London syndicate the second of HBAN’s international business angel groups.
The syndicate has been established to support the creation of a sustainable and driven international network with an affinity to Ireland. HBAN will supply high-potential, investor-ready early-stage and scaling companies to the network.
“The international syndicates are a testament to the quality of Irish start-ups with an international market focus,” said John Phelan, national director, HBAN.
“The launch of a second overseas syndicate is a significant step towards HBAN establishing a global business angel network that has an affinity to Ireland.”
The syndicate aims to invest in up to six Irish companies over 12 months with ambitions to expand into export markets, including Britain.
More than ten investors have signed up to the British syndicate, which is being led by experienced entrepreneur and angel investor Harry McDermott.

O’Brien’s treehouse is now in full Bloom

With his first ever show garden at Bloom Festival, taking place this weekend at the Phoenix Park in Dublin, landscaper Peter O’Brien is returning to his carpentry roots with a unique treehouse inspired by the American children’s author, Dr Seuss.
O’Brien began to design the treehouse and surrounding garden last February, inspired by the first treehouse he designed for a client in Westmeath seven years ago.
O’Brien moved into landscaping in the 1990s, having worked initially in construction, and established Plan Eden Garden Design in Kilpedder, Co Wicklow, in 1996.
“I’d run my own design and build company for 20 years, but I wasn’t feeling creatively fulfilled,” he said.
“I’d had a lifelong love of horticulture, coupled with structure and design, and that’s really what led me to a new career to garden design and landscape contracting.”
It was when an existing client asked O’Brien to design and build a treehouse for his children that the landscaper spotted a potential market niche for his varied skill-set.
“That really rekindled my love of carpentry and allowed me to explore architecture within a garden or landscape setting,” he said.
“It gave me an outlet to use all the skills I had collected over my career, from carpentry to architecture and horticulture to design.”
O’Brien designs treehouses for children and adults, as well as children’s play towers and play gardens, priced from €15,000.
He uses sustainable materials and his bespoke treehouses are fully insulated, wired for heating, light and electricity and incorporate double-glazed windows.
His Enchanted Wood show garden at Bloom has earned the designer a gold medal at this year’s festival.
Set on a woodland slope, the garden combines informal planting with elements of stone, water and wood. The treehouse can be reached by a rope-bridge suspended over a stream.
“It’s about imagination, but when I’m talking to clients generally about treehouses, I advise them to build a sustainable structure that’s durable and will grow with their children as they become adults,” he said.
“A treehouse can have more than one use. Children can use it to study as they get older, and parents can relax there with a glass of wine. It’s important to think carefully about the long-term function.”

RBK can guide charities through the regulatory maze
Sunday Business Post

Highlight: The accountancy firm has almost six decades of invaluable experience in the field, writes Arlene Harris 
Body


For almost six decades, RBK has provided accounting, audit and taxation services to businesses both at home and abroad. As Ireland’s largest independently branded accountancy firm, this established firm looks after clients in every sector, including not-for-profit (NFP) organisations.
Like all companies, not-for-profits also require auditing, financial reporting, tax and advisory services and RBK has a wealth of experience in dealing with these issues.
Ronan Kilbane is head of the charity and not-for-profit division within the firm, which has offices in Dublin, Athlone and Roscommon. He explained what the reporting requirements were for charitable organisations.
“The Charities Act 2009 contains eight sections which address financial recording and reporting matters for charities,” he said. “In addition, for incorporated charities [companies limited by guarantee], their reporting requirements are also derived from the Companies Act 2014.
“All organisations on the Register of Charities are required to provide information to the Charities Regulator CRA on their activities on a yearly basis. This is done by logging into their charity account and completing a template which requests financial information and facts about what activities were carried out by the charity.”
Kilbane said financial information and documentation required by the Charities Regulator for the annual return, varied, depending on the gross income of the charity and also the type of organisation.
“An incorporated charity must follow the requirements of the Companies Act 2014 as well as the Charities Act 2009,” Kilbane explained. “Generally, all incorporated charities with income greater than €100,000 prepare full audited accounts for the CRA and these are also filed with the Irish Companies Registration Office.
"Incorporated charities with income of less than €100,000 can avail of audit exemption but often, in reality, charities with income of less than €100,000 can also prepare full audited accounts if their constitution so dictates.
“An unincorporated charity with a gross annual income of €100,001 or more must provide a full set of audited accounts for the reporting period in question. While an unincorporated charity with a gross annual income of between €10,001 and €100,000 must provide a profit and loss account (or income and expenditure account and statement of assets and liabilities) for the reporting period in question.”
A specialist in this area, Kilbane went on to explain that an unincorporated charity with a gross annual income of less than €10,000 could choose to submit a profit and loss account (or income and expenditure account and statement of assets and liabilities) for the reporting period in question - but this is not required.
Education bodies (primary and secondary schools) and incorporated companies listed with the CRO may choose to submit a full set of audited accounts for the reporting period in question but, again, this is not required.
With many issues including GDPR and indeed Brexit impacting Irish businesses, Kilbane explains what challenges may face NFPs over the course of the next 12 months.
“There are ongoing viability and going concern issues such as ability to increase income and funding base and provide the desired level of frontline direct services,” he said. “The ability to fundraise and diversify income streams can be challenging so as to not place over reliance on only one source of funding.
“Rising general administration costs, support costs and governance costs will make it more difficult to allocate funding to front line direct costs. And sectoral reputational damage from recent charity frauds and scandals has led to enhanced public cynicism and apathy which continue to make fundraising more difficult.
“Regulatory compliance may also be an issue, especially if NFPs and charities are not currently SORP Compliant. And, lastly, staff retention and recruiting new staff are an issue for all sectors with a tightening labour market.”
With so many different factors to consider, NFP’s routinely need the input of experts and the accountancy firm, which was established in 1958, covers all of the areas which may require assistance including:
Statutory audit and assurance services
Bespoke internal controls and governance reviews for charities and NFP’s
Risk training and assistance in formalising a risk register
Governance training to boards on statutory roles and responsibilities of trustees of charities/NFPs
Internal audit services
HR solutions
Payroll solutions
IT solutions
“We offer experience and expertise, as we are dedicated specialists with a specific charities and not-for-profit team within RBK of around ten people,” said Kilbane.
“Being a larger firm, we have access to wider firm departments all under one roof such as tax, HR, IT and payroll, as well as bespoke accounting software to ensure compliance with SORP [accounting and reporting framework]. And given the volume of our NFP clients we have access to a wide database of best practices so we can see clearly what works successfully and what doesn’t.
“It is more advantageous to use an integrated accounting, audit and tax consultancy like ours, rather than individual expert consultants, as synergies can be obtained when all are under one roof and certain duplication of effort can be avoided. And more value can be added by the collaborative process of various departments bouncing ideas and solutions off each other.
"Also, there can be obvious cost benefits by just having one service provider, which can also cut down turnaround times, as deadlines can be more easily managed.”

The possibilities are there - just grasp them

Highlight: Willie O’Byrne, chairman of Retail Ireland, believes that the sector’s future looks bright despite a myriad of challenges, writes Graham Clifford 
Body


Rather than mourn the dilution of traditional retail in Ireland, the sector must do what it can to embrace technological change, cater for different customer needs while also maintaining its authenticity. That’s according to Willie O’Byrne, chairman of Retail Ireland.
Referring to the recent strategy document entitled ’Shaping the Future of Irish Retail 2020’ from Retail Ireland, O’Byrne told The Sunday Business Post that the future of Irish retail is brimming with possibilities, but they must be grasped.
He said: “The growth of foreign-based online retail is, of course, a concern for some retailers, but online retailing itself also presents so many possibilities. Online retail is certainly not our enemy, it is the future and we have to adapt to a changing world and embrace a path of progress where we move from being a traditional ’bricks and mortar’ business to a ’bricks and clicks’ one, where retailers offer consumers a consistent, high quality service, both instore and through online platforms.
“It’s also very important to understand that there’s only so much that online retailing can provide. During the recent Storm Emma, it wasn’t the online retailers who kept Ireland fed. No, it was the local retailers who did as they’ve done for so long: serve their customers, come rain or shine.“
Speaking ahead of the Inaugural Retail Ireland Lunch on Friday, June 8 at Dublin’s Conrad Hotel, O’Byrne acknowledged that Irish retail is already feeling the ill wind of Brexit, and that the outcome of negotiations on the Customs Union debate with Theresa May’s government will have a significant impact on Irish retailers’ bottom line.
“In the immediate aftermath of Brexit the value of sterling fell by over 20 per cent,“ he said. “This in turn strengthened the hand of British-based online traders, who almost overnight experienced a dramatic improvement in their relative competitive position.
“Irish retailers reacted by cutting prices and heavily discounting key lines. A deflationary trend in retail prices was already well established, however, with retail prices falling consistently over the last decade. Intense competition in the sector has driven prices down to the point that they are now on a par with prices from the year 2000. That’s a problem.
“In contrast, we’re seeing price inflation in key input costs. All of this creates concerns for the long-term competitiveness of Irish retail. Our government, and its European allies, must do all they can to try and protect Irish retail and ensure our supply chains, via Britain, are not severely disrupted as a consequence of Brexit.
“We have a relatively small manufacturing base here, and depend on a modern international supply chain where products are long-lined every day into the country and through hub and spoke distribution systems reach their end destination. Rather than storing them in warehouses for weeks, we successfully operate a just-in-time supply chain system which runs smoothly. It works for Ireland.
“But if the movement of goods from, or through, Britain slows down considerably after Brexit that will impact Irish retailers. That’s the outcome we really don’t want to see. The wider impact of Brexit on agriculture and our export economy will also impact consumer confidence and, as a consequence, consumer spend.“
Retail, unlike many other sectors, has managed to ride out waves in the past. Many retailers operate agile and adaptable business models, now offering professional advancement and varied careers to employees.
Indeed, careers is one of the four pillars of the recent strategy plan, as O’Byrne explains.
“In many ways the potential for career development and progression in the retail sector has been undersold. There are incredible professional opportunities in both back office and front of store retail: well-paid and rewarding positions which require a varied skills base. Our Retail Ireland Skillnet programmes help people acquire a wide range of internationally accredited qualifications and we’re in the process of developing an apprenticeship scheme unique to the Irish retail sector. There’s so much scope for development and sideways movement in retail which you’d struggle to find in other sectors. But we must continue to work to shout that from the roof tops, so people are aware.“
And the other three pillars of the strategy? Competitiveness, confidence and community.
“Clearly, competitiveness is crucial no matter what field of business you are in,“ says O’Byrne. “In Ireland there is so much which could be done to assist retailers. The government has an important role to play with issues such as insurance and local authority rates - two areas of major concern.
“We’re competing with online retailers, often based overseas, which aren’t paying rates – how is that fair? And the current local authority rates system is antiquated and needs close scrutiny. In terms of insurance, it’s a very opaque sector which, almost always, seems stacked against the retailer. From rising employer and public liability insurance to transport insurance, the retailer is constantly paying vast sums, though it’s often impossible to understand why premiums are so high or why they are rising.“
That said, O’Byrne is fully aware of the retailer’s responsibility to reduce risks and consequently incidents and accidents.
Support for the retail sector, which employs 280,000 people in Ireland today, is crucial according to him, not just from an economic point of view but from a social one as well.
“Social hubs in rural areas throughout the country are built around the local shop and other such businesses,“ he says. “Take those away, and the fabric of these areas is lost. Consumer confidence in these areas is so very fragile. The closure of one shop can have a massive ripple effect, and we have to be conscious of that. Retail delivers much more than just the product to the consumer.“
But despite the challenges, the possibility of further economic flux, and the growing shadow of online retail, O’Byrne believes the future for a transforming and thriving Irish retail sector is bright.
“I’m very bullish when it comes to areas like convenience retail which we do better than anyone else in the world,“ he says. “The little retailers in Ireland are exceptional with a renewed focus on freshness and food to go you just don’t experience elsewhere.
“There are many other examples where Irish retail stands head and shoulders above its international peers. The retail sector provides 14 percent of national employment and delivers around €7 billion in tax take to the exchequer. Retailers take pride in their delivery in Ireland, and our standards of customer service are excellent.
“I believe the retail sector will continue to grow despite everything, at a rate of between 1 and 2 per cent a year. That really is impressive, in a time of such change and uncertainty.“

Volvo’s new V60 is a real super trooper

Highlight: Stylish but practical, the latest Volvo model is the best Swedish news since the ABBA reunion 
Body


There’s no denying that Scandinavia is currently at the forefront of our minds. Agnetha, Benny, Björn and Anni-Frid are getting back together to create yet more catchy pop tunes and, if you prefer their old hits, there’s an upcoming sequel to Mamma Mia! in which Pierce Brosnan will once again attempt to croak out some ABBA classics. Ahem. Elsewhere, there’s The Bridge, the dark and dangerous Scandi-noir TV drama, and Jo Nesbo’s inventively gruesome crime novels.
Then there’s Volvo, a company that seems to have finally found its feet, in a business sense. The Swedish brand has certainly had its moments over the years, from its invention of three-point safety belts to its inimitable square-rigged estate car design of yore.
But with backing from Chinese car-making giant Geely, Volvo has in recent times suddenly moved from the periphery into the mainstream of the premium car world. Its sales are growing fast, and it’s opening new factories in China and the US.
Its cars are, in sales and quality terms, now nipping hard at the heels of the likes of BMW, Audi and Mercedes; and it enjoys a rating for reliability that isn’t far away from Toyota’s.
For years, Volvo’s combined dedication to the causes of safety and environmental friendliness (it essentially invented the technology that allowed for catalytic converters) has seemed at odds with buyers’ increasing devotion to German sportiness and aggression.
But now it seems Scandinavian practicality and style are in fashion, and Volvo is gaining in popularity. Sales are up, and what was once a two-model company now has eight model ranges, with more on the way.
It has also built conspicuous success on the back of increasing SUV sales, starting with the first XC90 way back in 2003, which has recently been named as the safest car ever tested by British-based crash test experts Thatcham.
In fact, according to Thatcham, not one single vehicle occupant has been killed while driving or being driven in an XC90 since it was launched. The more recent XC60 and XC40 crossovers are achieving similar sales and safety successes, but now, with this new V60, we return to Volvo’s heartland – the safe and sensible family estate.
Neither ‘safe’ nor ‘sensible’ are words that immediately spring to mind when one sets eyes upon the new V60. Sensual would be more like it. The V60, which copies many of the lines and shapes from the larger Volvo V90 – is a very handsome car indeed.
Even our Inscription-spec test cars, which are not as sporty to look at as the upcoming R-Design models, look very striking, and when a car can carry off a dour colour such as Volvo’s new ‘Pepper Grey’ (which is really metallic beige) this well, you know it has fashion-model good looks.
The cabin is equally handsome, and again lifts copiously from the larger V90, along with the closely mechanically related XC60. The 12.3-inch TFT screen digital instrumentation is standard for Irish buyers, as is the nine-inch ‘Sensus’ satnav and entertainment touchscreen, which is a model of simplicity and ease of use.
The rest of the interior is little short of lovely – great comfort, very good space (Volvo claims class-leading rear legroom) and sweet touches such as the tactile surface of the optional Lime Wood trim, or the subtle Swedish flag sewn into the side of a front seat.
Many premium-brand estates sacrifice rear load space on the altar of styling, and glancing at the V60’s sculpted haunches, you’d assume the same applies here. Not so, though. In fact, the V60’s boot trounces rivals such as the Audi A4 Avant and the BMW 3 Series Touring by around 30 litres, with a 529-litre seats-up capacity. There are also flip-up-divider panels in the floor and numerous hooks and tie-down points for securing shopping or luggage, so clearly Volvo has not lost its flair for making useful, usable load spaces. The tailgate is, as standard, electrically operated too.
Up front, what you won’t be expecting to find, given that Volvo swore off diesel power for the related S60 saloon, is a diesel engine. Yet here one most definitely is, and when the V60 arrives in Ireland for the first time in June, there will only be the option of D3 150hp and D4 190hp diesel engines. Petrol T4 and T5 engines, and two plug-in hybrid options (a 340hp T6 and 390hp T8) will follow in time for 191 registrations.
The reason for the split decision on diesel? Simply because the S60 is primarily designed to be sold in the US and China, where diesel power is essentially non-existent, whereas the V60’s primary arena is Europe, where both family and fleet buyers are still expected to crave diesel in sufficient numbers for it to be worthwhile.
While it might be unfashionable to say it, the D4 diesel engine is the pick of the V60’s line-up right now. It’s a familiar engine, and you’ll find it in most other Volvo products, but here in the V60 it seems more refined and quiet than it has done for a while.
If the 190hp and 400Nm of torque don’t add up to electrifying performance, then the V60 D4 is at least swift enough for most purposes, and should easily bust through the 50mpg barrier in daily driving. On basic wheels and tyres, with the optional eight-speed automatic gearbox fitted (Volvo’s own design), emissions are kept to a reasonable 119g/km, but be aware that bigger wheels and sportier tyres will drive that up quite significantly.
But fitting bigger wheels and tyres would really kind of defeat the point. They might look good, but bigger rims and lower-profile rubber are not going to turn the V60 into an aggressive driver’s car. Like the bigger S90 and V90 (with which the V60 shares a chassis and engines), the V60 is essentially quite a languid car to drive.
Its steering is numb, but nicely weighted and accurate. Its ride is comfortable and, if that means that the body’s movements through corners are not as tightly controlled as in a BMW, then the trade-off is greater comfort when you’re trying to relax, which will be most of the time.
Contributing equally to the relaxation are exceptional levels of silence in the cabin, and Volvo’s safety reputation, which this time includes Pilot Assist that helps keep you in lane, while using radar to adjust the cruise control on the motorway. There’s also an updated autonomous emergency braking system which can help prevent a collision with a car or pedestrian, and which now can brake hard to avoid an oncoming vehicle too.
Selling any estate to an Irish audience fixated on SUVs and crossovers is never going to be an easy day’s work, but the V60 is most definitely a car that deserves some attention. With a combination of high quality, safety, reliability, comfort and desirable styling, it’s a Scandi without the drama.

‘If you are honest with people, you form good relationships’

Byline: Post Reporter
Highlight: Each week, we profile one of Ireland’s corporate leaders, tracing their career to date and exploring the lessons they have learned along the way. This week, we meet Mark O’Rourke of Bibby Financial Services Ireland 
Body


Mark O’Rourke was appointed managing director of Bibby Financial Services Ireland (BFSI) last January.
The company provides invoice funding, finance and discounting services to business in Ireland. It is part of Bibby Financial Services Group and a member of the Asset Based Finance Association.
BFSI recently announced that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland would be extending an existing lending facility by €25 million.
The company employs 30 people. O’Rourke joined in 2006 and was head of business before taking up his current role.
Tell us about your career to date.
I qualified in sales and marketing and, after a short stint working in a garage, I applied to Bank of Ireland. These were the days when a job in the bank was viewed as a job for life.
After two years of various contract positions, I secured a permanent position with BOI Commercial Finance.
Over the course of eight years, I worked my way up to a junior management position. I was hungry to progress, but there were people ahead of me who had great pensionable roles and weren’t going to give them up, so I looked outside the bank and found Bibby Financial Services Ireland (BFSI).
I’ve held a number of operational and commercial roles at BFSI, including head of risk, which gave me insight into geopolitical events like Brexit and its potential consequences for Irish SMEs.
Are you where you expected to be in your career?
It’s a very interesting question, and the honest answer is no. As a young man starting out, I knew I wanted to be successful in the commerce world and that I wanted to repay the sacrifices my parents had made to put me through college.
So that was my driver – the specific area that I wasn’t worldly-wise enough to have figured out at that point. The bank seemed like a great place to start the journey as, in those days, it was a permanent and pensionable post.
Moving to BFSI provided me with the opportunity be part of and help influence a growing business.
I was working towards leading a business, but that takes time and requires experience – I am very fortunate that Bibby Financial Services was prepared to offer me the opportunity to gain these experiences and support me on my journey.
What was the best career advice you got along the way?
The person in question wasn’t actually giving me advice, but taught me a great lesson. Around ten years ago, I went into a meeting with a preconceived notion of how it was going to go. It didn’t go as I had planned, and I felt like a fool at the end of it. I carry that meeting with me to this day, and ensure I always prepare for all eventualities. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.
Also, although it’s not directly career advice, something I learned from my parents is that honesty is the best policy.
If you are honest and consistent with people, you form the best working relationships.
Based on your own experience, what are your top career tips?
n Never think you know it all: be prepared to listen and gain from others.
n Be fair in your dealings with people.
n Bring solutions to the table – it’s easy to find a reason why something can’t be done.
n Add value, whether to the company you work for or the clients you service.
How would you define your work style, and how has this evolved over the years?
I always talk in terms of “we” and “our”. This is our business and we don’t have staff or employees, we are colleagues. It is very important that people feel part of the team and that they can share in any success.
In terms of managing teams and individuals, what are your insights?
My overriding message to my colleagues is that we are fair to each other. The business is fair to them, they are fair to the business and each is fair to each other.
Encourage your team to contribute. You don’t have to take on every suggested change, but you will find some gems along the way.
Which brings me to empowerment – trust your colleagues to make decisions. Empowerment gives a real sense of belonging to something, that your opinion really counts. We spend so much time in work that it has to feel more than 9 to 5 and robotic functioning in between.
What about communication and negotiating the typical ups and downs of working life?
Back to honesty is the best policy. It’s always good to hear feedback from colleagues about their insights into business performance, what is going well, maybe not so well and how they feel they can contribute.
I am the leader, but I can’t pretend to be an expert in everything that makes up the business. My colleagues are the experts, so why wouldn’t I listen to them, take on board their opinions and encourage them to give their views? A suggestion mightn’t work for now, but once you can be clear as to why it won’t work, then people can understand, and won’t be discouraged from contributing again.
Has networking played an important part in your career?
I have benefited enormously by listening and learning from colleagues, clients, advisers and contacts over the years. One big ‘no’ for me with networking is making selling the sole purpose of the conversation. Placing yourself in the right environment to enable others achieve their ambitions will help you achieve yours.
I always abide by the mantra that I should be adding a net benefit to the person or company I am dealing with. Any other approach is too short-sighted, in my opinion.
If you had to choose another career tomorrow, what would it be, and why?
Now there’s a question. This would only work if I was free from any financial responsibilities. My family and I (my wife and I have four boys) moved from Dublin last year to rural Kildare. If I had the chance, I’d like to spend more time fundraising for the local GAA club – I think it’s an invaluable resource in any local community.

Highlight: If you aren’t glued to Love Island, you’re missing out. Come for the bikini bodies and onscreen hook-ups; stay for the unexpected true romance 
Body


You probably think Love Island isn’t for you, but you’re wrong. Please let me convince you, I beg of you. Let me convince you before it’s back on our screens tomorrow night. You won’t regret it.
“What is it?” I hear you ask. “People riding on telly? Big Brother in bikinis? Nah, sounds shite.” It does sound shite on paper, I’ll give you that. And yes, there are people riding on telly, and it is a bit like Big Brother in bikinis, but it’s also so, so much more.
Love Island was my favourite TV show of 2017. I missed out on the first few weeks, but as the hype grew so did my interest and I tuned in. And then I tuned in every evening for the remaining two months, closing the curtains against the last of the 9pm summer brightness and longing for each episode to be two, nay THREE hours long.
It was broadcast on ITV2 in Britain and 3e here in Ireland, but for those of us who are slaves to ye olde UPC box, ITV wasn’t an option and 3e was a day behind, leading to frantic VPN hook-ups and – I’m not ashamed to admit – dodgy streaming.
I just couldn’t wait a day. I couldn’t risk the spoilers. But this year, 3e has confirmed that it will be broadcasting Love Island concurrently with ITV2. No more furtive searching for ITV2 streams. Hallelujah.
Love Island’s premise is simple. A bunch of perma-tanned, super-attractive, fame-hungry fine young things are sent to live together in a Majorcan villa for two months.
They must “couple up” with someone, and then endeavour to stay in a couple until the end. Producers throw spanners in the works by organising regular “recouplings” and anyone who’s dumped gets sent home. It’s brutal, calculating, thrilling and . . . weirdly romantic. The cast of characters chosen for the 2017 series was perfect. There was puppy dog Kem, who’d never been in love before. There was the misunderstood villain Olivia, who tried but failed to deny her feelings for the lovable but flawed Chris.
There was Disney princess Camilla, who has a date with Prince Harry under her belt. She had her heart broken by the evil Jonny in the villa, and it’s fair to say his reputation will never, ever recover. Never fear, though, because impossibly handsome Calvin Klein model Jamie swung in on a vine to save her and, get this, they’re still together!
Last year’s Love Island was the third series, and they managed to get it just right. While the show isn’t groundbreaking, the beauty of 2017’s run was that among all the reality show tropes and twists, there was that cast of funny, enthusiastic, horny young people who really did seem to forget the cameras were there and really did feel like they were falling in love.
Their inhibitions went out the window and there were undulating duvets as far as the eye can see, but rather than seeming exploitative or crass, it was funny. You were rooting for them to get the ride. You were rooting for the couples you liked to stay together. You were rooting for the hilarious bromance between Kem and Chris to endure – and if Instagram is to be believed, it has.
Of course, it’s not without its problems. Love Island is heterosexual to a fault: something that came up again and again in criticism. Would the introduction of bisexual contestants do something to address the concerns? Maybe. Or what about a gay Love Island?
I’d put money on those conversations having already happened in production meetings, but with the 2018 cast already revealed it’s not looking likely for the fourth series. Among the contestants are Danny Dyer’s daughter Dani, A&E doctor Alex, model Hayley and student Niall. Smoking was another big headache for the show last year, and there were actually more complaints about smoking than there were about sex scenes.
And of course, there’s yet to be a plus-sized person in the villa. “Curvy” is about as close as they’ve come, but abs and traditional bikini bodies seem to be more the order of the day.
Problems aside, Love Island 2017 was one of the most written about shows of last summer, and the fourth series is one of the most anticipated programmes of 2018. I have everything crossed that they’ve managed to get the cast right again, and that the perfect blend of drama, humour and friendship prevails.
Have I convinced you yet? Will you give it a go? It’s on 3e/ITV2 tomorrow night at 9pm. Go on.

This week, I will mostly be:
Ireland’s very own Chelsea Flower Show is back in the Phoenix Park this weekend, running until tomorrow. Deep down we know that the likes of Bloom and Taste of Dublin are just expensive ways for desperate middle-class parents to have a sanctioned afternoon drink while their children are somewhat corralled. But having visited the Bloom setting during the week I can see the appeal. Lovely plants and the promise of a bit of sun? Pass me the overpriced wine.
Recommended by a friend months ago and dancing around in my Netflix ‘recommended’ stream for nearly as long, I’m ashamed to say that this show is into its fourth season and I’ve only just clambered onto the bandwagon. A rich family loses everything and has to move to a rural backwater and make nice with the residents. It’s unexpected and funny and features the always brilliant Catherine O’Hara as the melodramatic matriarch.
I wrote a few months back about the greatest of all the rom-com genres: Sexy Seniors. Book Club is finally hitting cinemas this weekend and stars Diane Keaton being vulnerable, Jane Fonda as a sizzling seductress, Candice Bergen as an uptight judge and more Viagra jokes than you can shake a stick at. Sign me up!

Highlight: It’s time to stop stigmatising the singleton – and instead to learn to see people for who they are 
Body


We live in a post-referendum world now. Thanks to Ireland’s decisive vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment and end an oppressive abortion regime, women are a lot more equal these days. Like men, we now have control over our own bodies, and it feels good. Unsettling and disorientating, if truth be told, but good.
But it all makes me wonder: considering how overwhelmingly people voted to usher in this new era, what other anachronisms are still at play in Irish life that we would also do well to repeal; to chase out with a broom and few choice insults?
Personally, I’d love to see a change in our fusty old attitudes when it comes to the traditionally fraught topics of sex, dating and relationships.
Take it from me – speaking as someone who has spent many years in long-term relationships and plenty of time more recently being single too – the pen portrait for singletons is still the tired old caricature of Bridget Jones wailing into her blue soup about her inability to attract Mr Darcy, or a strained Carrie Bradshaw agonising about her romances in Sex and the City.
We may have moved on from the crinolines and ballgowns in Pride and Prejudice, but our attitudes have not evolved in tandem.
A singleton – particularly a female one – is regarded by society as a problem to solve. That’s the situation even though all the evidence is there to show that, in fact, both sexes are far more likely to be single for longer periods than in previous generations. Surveys reveal that we live longer, marry later and do terribly foolish things on Tinder in the meantime – and yet, in polite society, when the conversation turns to relationships, we still wheel out the same old thundering tropes.
Singletons are constantly on the defensive, forced to explain away solo holidays and their lack of a plus-one at weddings, even as they can be entirely joyful and content. Meanwhile, no matter how miserable you are in a relationship, you are forced to keep that mouth zipped, because society has ordained it so: couples are by default happy, single women are Bridget Jones in a bad frock. And it’s all such nonsense, such grating cliché.
Of course, I hear you say, there are times when being in a long-term relationship makes sense. After all, who wants to feel lonely, particularly as you go into your more senior years? Agreed. But haven’t we also made too much of a bogeyman of loneliness? In Viv Albertine’s new book, she writes of how loneliness should be regarded, rather splendidly, as similar to having a cough or cold, and seen as a fleeting condition rather than an endless state of being. The author Decca Aitkenhead is even more interesting on the subject. “Loneliness is not an absence of company, but of meaning,” she writes in her memoir All At Sea.
A relationship, then, is one way to generate meaning, and not the only way. But still there are couples who would rather stick together like a badly assembled bookcase from Ikea than admit to the world that they’re horrifically incompatible and would do better to separate.
Their fears have taken them over, and society is complicit in that; complicit in stigmatising the singleton and valorising coupledom. It’s remarkable to think about how far we’ll go just to avoid having an empty seat next to us at a wedding. The whole way to the altar ourselves, in fact.
To my mind, the best argument to get into a long-term relationship early is for those people who want to have children. If you’re not fussed about having kids – and truly, despite being in my late 30s, I’ve spent more time in life contemplating where I’ll get my next coffee than the parlous state of my eggs – then it might be worth considering your options carefully.
Marriage was an institution designed for people who conked out in their 40s, not their 80s. Now that we’re around for longer, it simply makes sense to get hitched later.
This was exactly the point that Chelsea Handler made in her Netflix series a few years ago. The chat show host had dated Fifty Cent and hotelier Andre Balazs, and had a great time – and now that she had hit her early 40s, she felt she had arrived at an age where it might be nice to meet someone for a long-term relationship. I loved her attitude. Handler wasn’t trying to look down on anyone for their coupled-up status; but neither was she demeaning herself, à la Bridget Jones from the 1990s. She was just being real about her situation, and it was refreshing.
Perhaps as we continue on into 2018 and beyond, we can learn to start recognising each other more properly, and stop stigmatising according to mothballed and exhausted ways of living and thinking. Is that kind of revolution in our mindset possible? If we’ve learned anything from this year, it’s that anything is.

Taking silk

Length: 502 words
Byline: Elaine Prendeville
Highlight: From pillowcases to pyjamas, eye masks to robes, it’s all about the exquisite luxuriance of silk as far as Dublin-born designer Eva Power is concerned 
Body


The very definition of self-appreciation? Two words: silk pyjamas.
If your sleepwear wardrobe - like mine - is more tired than inspired, it may be time to make the transition. Dubliner Eva Power is a firm believer in the benefits of nocturnal silk: she sleeps on a silk pillowcase, wearing silk pyjamas of her own creation. It’s a habit formed from childhood, when Power’s aunt would send silk scarves home from India, and her mother would encourage a young Eva to sleep on them. Glossier hair, smoother skin, and more . . . the many virtues of sleeping on this luxurious fabric were to make her a lifetime convert.
[caption id="attachment_417710" align="alignright" width="701"] Mulberry silk camisole and shorts set in coral/ grey, €120[/caption]
Power set up her Ethical Silk Company in 2009, following a twentysomething-dom spent travelling along the Silk Road. “After completing an Arts degree,” she tells me, “I spent a good chunk of time travelling to China, Mongolia, Pakistan, Iran and countries in Central Asia. The abundance of colourful fabrics and textiles started me thinking about producing some textiles of my own.”
Silk pillowcases came first and remain a best-seller. “They’re a go-to gifting choice,” Power says. Last year, a capsule collection of luxury loungewear was supplemented by silk pyjamas, eye masks and robes. That offering is now bedding down, with this season’s iterations of mulberry silk hand-printed sleepwear proving an international hit.
“The majority of our orders come from the US, where I’ve had some great press,” Power says, “and the vast majority of our customers are females over the age of 30. The silk pyjamas are seen as quite a personal purchase, and a carefully considered wardrobe staple.”
A star performer has been the mulberry silk pyjama set in ‘Jaipur Gold’, with French seams, mother of pearl buttons and natural ivory piping. At €245, it’s an investment, but one Power assures will hold appeal for years to come. Care is crucial, meaning no heavy-duty washing, ironing or tumble drying allowed (detailed care instructions can be found on Power’s website, theethicalsilkco.com). Also selling well are eye masks, €30; lounge pants, €120, camisole sets, €120 and silk robes, €195 in a variety of colour ways including skin-flattering corals and teal.
Better yet, the ‘ethical’ tag withstands scrutiny. Power uses a sustainable supply chain, working with a trusted tailoring and printing unit in India, and donating 5 per cent of her profits to charities in India and another 5 per cent at home, to Focus Ireland. “I’ve always wanted to support the dedicated work they do,” she says.
As her business grows, she offsets the professional with life in Kimmage in the company of her husband and their two young boys, aged four and six. “I do enjoy getting over to India when I can,” she says, “but with a young family, it’s all a bit of a juggle.”
Busy the days may be, but one thing’s certain: Eva Power is sleeping in a little more style than most.

The ten Cru that saved Beaujolais
Sunday Business Post
May 31, 2018


Copyright 2018 Post Publications Ltd. All Rights Reserved

 
Length: 992 words
Byline: Tomás Clancy
Highlight: The family wineries of Beaujolais have made the region the hipster’s choice by staying true to their roots 
Body


The wines of Beaujolais have become France’s hippest wines over the last couple of years. This stunning transformation has been brought about by the work of Beaujolais’s ten brilliant and unique Cru, the distinct small appellations that sit at the top of Beaujolais hierarchy.
Within this, dozens of artisanal and often family-run wineries have managed to transform Beaujolais into the hippest sommelier’s choice, the darling of the Michelin set and the poster child for a European-wide artisan producer revival.
They have done this by remaining loyal to their local and unique grape varietal, gamay and the myriad, subtle ways it responds to the very diverse nature of the soils and microclimates of each of their Cru. In addition, they have embraced organic, biodynamic and natural wine-making techniques and the almost wilfully uncommercial diversity of styles and tastes in wines produced in each Cru.
The idiosyncracy and the quirkiness of each Cru seem to have struck a chord, with sommeliers and adventurous wine lovers bringing Beaujolais to such widespread acclaim today.
1. Saint-Amour
This appellation is located just to the south of the town and wine region of Mâcon in Burgundy. Many Mâcon producers, who make only white wine, use Saint-Amour as a location for light red wine from the gamay grape. The soils are a similar granitic and clay mix to Mâcon. Very little gets to Ireland except for around St Valentine’s Day.
2. Juliénas
This claims to be the oldest vineyard region in Beaujolais, and is named for Julius Caesar who is said to have ordered planting here. This is highly unlikely, as both Saint-Amour and Juliénas are very exposed, militarily, and are relatively low-lying areas. The best contemporary claim to Roman origin planting is Cru number 9, Côte de Brouilly with nicely defensible landscape and Roman remains. The wines here are often a little rustic and benefit from plenty of decanting.
3. Chénas
One of the smallest Cru. The wines tend towards the rough, stalky and tannic. However, with several years of age, they are earthy honest delights.
4. Moulin-à-Vent
The tenderloin of new Beaujolais, the soils here are brittle with clay, some pink granite and plenty of shimmering quartz. Deeper down, there are patches of manganese which produce low-yielding, stressed vineyards of immense concentration, exotic violet flickers and fuller bodied tannins.
These wines can feel like very aged pinot noir after just a few years, and have decades of evolving potential. This is gold-rush central.
5. Fleurie
This is probably the best known of the Beaujolais Cru in Ireland, famously offering delicate wines with a perfumed nose of violets over a medium bodied but quite firm finish. A delicate delight of a wine.
6. Chiroubles
Difficult to source in Ireland, these wines tend to be very delicate, quite game-like and medium to light-bodied, with pointed acidity. Chiroubles is located high above Fleurie, just to its west, but the winding, near-vertical roads make it feel further away.
7. Morgon
The town of Morgon is home to a few of the region’s superstars such as Jean Folliard and Marcel Lapierre. The vines here sit on a high plateau of iron-rich orange soils, not unlike Australia’s Coonawarra. The tenderloin potion is called Côte du Py, which you should look out for on labels. The wines here are beefy and age well over many years.
8. Régnié
Another of the smaller Beaujolais Cru. The vineyards here sit in ridiculously beautiful countryside, full of hidden hamlets, endless twisty roads and mystical forested slopes. The soils are granite again, of the pinkish kind. The wines are fruity in youth, which is when they are best.
9. Brouilly
The AC Brouilly is the largest of the Beaujolais Cru with portions sitting on volcanic soils and some on granite. The wines are varied, from beefy to floral and delicate, so knowing your producer is key with stars like Château de Pierreux or avant-garde players such as Jean-Paul Brun being the names to look out for.
10. Côte de Brouilly
This is the Pomerol of Beaujolais. That is to say, Côte de Brouilly wines are the more polished and opulent wines when compared to its neighbours’ admitted beefy charms. The vineyards here sit on a spectacular dormant volcano and its dome. The wines share a deep, low-noted intensity, have a muscular dark-fruited palate and can be profound with age.
Embracing the diversity of these ten Cru, ambitious and meticulous producers have kickstarted Beaujolais’s renaissance. These producers embrace the quirkiness of flavour and vintage variation their Cru brings. They see it as a riposte to international varietals, and homogenised, commercial wines, making them pioneers on a new frontier of authenticity and excitement.

Bring on the bling
Amid all that murky and murderous intent, the TV series The Assassination of Gianni Versace has featured one very important thing: bling. For summer 2018, Donatella Versace has plumbed her brother Gianni’s archive to produce ‘Tribute’, a clothing and accessories collection that celebrates his bold, iconic style. “Each year Gianni lived, he lived to its fullest,” she says. “Throughout his career, he created collections that to this day are considered a cultural point of reference and inspiration to many.” Pick up a little piece of the legacy with a pair of ‘Tribute’ collection sunglasses, priced from €235 at Brown Thomas Dublin now.

TO TRY: Delheim Wines, Chardonnay Sur Lie, Stellenbosch, South Africa 2014, €24.95 from O’Briens Wines stores and online at obrienswine.ie nationwide (92)
This is a meticulously made wine that uses traditional techniques of hand-picking, wild yeast fermenting and ageing on lees, that is letting the wine rest on grape pulp and old yeast, rather like leaving a teabag in a cup to extract more flavour. This has produced an opulent chardonnay with toasty brioche-like notes and flickers of honey and hazelnut, evoking the flavours of an expensive Meursault. This is a daring move, as many wine critics have over the last decade dismissed New World attempts as over-oaked imitation. This must-try wine destroys that argument.
Somewhat surprisingly, I found myself tasting two wines from Columbia Valley in Washington State in one week. I do not think there is any large push afoot by the Washington winemakers to break the Irish market, but it is very clear that there is real value to be had there. This is a rich, luxurious Riesling with heady petroleum and lime like notes that you occasionally find on aged German Riesling. It is a very particular taste profile that goes well with creamy pork dishes and charred or barbecued chicken. A leftfield delight.
Winemaker Pierre Chermette is one of the most progressive of the new wave Beaujolais producers, and makes some brilliant wines within the ten great Cru we examine in the main article. However, like many pushing at the limits, Chermette also makes some fascinating wines outside the Cru and their legal and technical rules. The experimentation here produces a startlingly rich and complex chardonnay. Touches of baked apple, soft hazelnut and a slightly opulent finish make this a very Burgundian charmer at a discount.

Cloud journeys and detours

Highlight: Organisations are still reluctant to migrate big parts of their businesses to the cloud and are not always convinced by the benefits. Ian Campbell reports  
Body


Some ten years after the concept of cloud computing as we know it today began to take shape, it’s clear it triggered a paradigm shift in the way IT is delivered and consumed. Almost every type of organisation has undertaken some kind of cloud journey, though the destination is not always clear and the benefits sometimes uncertain. Some argue that it means so many different things to different people that it gets in the way of vendor/customer conversations.
‘Cloud’ is certainly not a word that Michele Neylon, chief executive of Blacknight Solutions, likes to use. The main customer base for his domain registry and hosting business is small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and he’d rather have a conversation with them about outsourcing. “That’s what it is at the simplest level — essentially it’s about using someone else’s resources. It’s a very attractive alternative to having to buy and manage physical servers,” he said.
Blacknight started in 2003 and has mirrored the way the market has evolved, all the time adding services to capitalise on a growing demand for hosted solutions accessed over broadband connections. Two years ago Microsoft Office 365 was added to its catalogue, a move that made perfect sense for its target market because it solves a lot of SME headaches.
“Not so long ago, if you wanted the office suite and antivirus, you had to buy a box of disks and install it yourself, and do it all over again when the new version came out,” Neylon said. “Now you come to a company like Blacknight, tell us what you want and we will give it to you on subscription.”
Neylon shares a long list of the benefits: software that’s always up to date, patched and secure, always available remotely on any device, that can be scaled up or down as required by adding or removing users. This agility is key to everything that Blacknight provides. In the case of infrastructure and servers, it can be CPU, disk space or Ram.
The benefits are clear but Neylon is quick to point out that they are not for everyone. “For some people, a cloud service might not be suitable; they might be better off talking to us about co-location or having a dedicated server. It all comes down to total cost of ownership. Every business has to look at the value they are getting from a particular service because it will always depend on who you are and what you do,” he said. “Value isn’t always easy to define.”
He gives the example of local GPs. They are responsible for collecting and processing a lot of sensitive patient data and need to ensure it’s managed securely. Similarly, highly regulated financial services companies have to be circumspect with customer information.
“The value of securing data is much higher to both of these than it might be for other types of business. What’s the cost of medical records that are breached or of an insurance broker having client details stolen?” asked Neylon. “What’s really scary is that people in both of these environments are probably using email accounts like Gmail that are not as secure as they could be.”
His argument is that every type of business needs to carry out a risk assessment based on the cost to the company if something bad happens — reputational as well as financial. This is an important way to determine the real value of cloud services to a business and it will also inform the kind of services that are required.
Andrew McDaniel, sales director for cloud client-computing at Dell EMC, still meets a lot of Irish organisations who are reluctant to entrust critical business applications to the cloud. “They’re keeping them in-house, sometimes because they’ve built up the knowledge and capabilities to be able to control the applications themselves without having to rely on an external vendor,” he said.
More worrying are the businesses he comes across that migrated applications to the cloud only to change their minds and take them back on premise.
Expectations are clearly not being met. In McDaniel’s experience, it’s often to do with cost. It’s well documented that organisations are attracted to the idea of replacing hefty capital costs — money spent on systems infrastructure — with operational expenditure via subscription services.
“The problem is that the costs can spiral out of control and get to the point where the CFO wants to bring some of it back in-house to save money,” he said. “It can be down to fast-growing storage requirements, or wanting better SLAs [Service Level Agreements]. Quite often it’s adding more applications, doing something that hadn’t originally been planned. When they add up the costs they are sometimes substantially higher than on premise.”
[caption id="attachment_417592" align="alignright" width="575"] Joe Roche of Blueface[/caption]
The upshot of all of this is that McDaniel expects a hybrid approach to remain the predominant strategy. Companies are happy to take low-hanging fruit from the cloud, like Office 365, but will keep other applications and services closer, particularly if there is highly sensitive data involved. He believes GDPR has made organisations even less inclined to trust data to a third party.
Dell EMC always argues that hybrid plays perfectly into its hand, claiming to be the only vendor that can deliver a “true end-to-end solution” because its technologies span all environments, from the data centre to the desktop. One of the areas where the company is expecting growth is around its virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) portfolio. The idea of hosting a desktop operating system on a centralised server in a data centre has been around for many years, but it’s struggled to gain traction.
Dell EMC believes that’s about to change. “We’re now seeing it adopted as part of a hybrid configuration. VMware Horizon View helps manage both on premise and cloud-based VDI sessions and we frequently pair it with infrastructure run on our VX Rail appliances, that include powerful GPUs [Graphics Processing Units],” explained McDaniel.
As organisations advance their digital transformation strategies, it’s essential to ensure that customers and employees have the best possible digital experience. This is why McDaniel believes faster GPUs are now essential for more than just high-performance applications like CAD. “The reality is that GPUs benefit every type of application. A faster chip will solve lag problems in something like an Office 365 document. If you can’t deliver 30 frames-per-second in a VDI scenario, then you’re a dead duck,” he said.
Returning to Dell EMC’s end-to-end theme, McDaniel is also keen to push the power of the Wyse thin clients it deploys to manage, optimise and secure the user endpoints in VDI environments. “We sell the idea of secure access to data from pretty much any location using any device, but when a customer brings data on to a local device they are leaving themselves potentially exposed,” he said. “Companies are starting to see that leveraging our thin client suite is a good security play.”
The cost-saving benefits of the cloud may have been called into question, but there are undisputed benefits of the virtualised platforms that provide highly scalable platforms for public and private cloud environments. “When I talk to companies, the number one reason they choose to move to the cloud is the agility and speed they get. With cloud computing you’re able to spin up a complex environment in hours as opposed to the weeks it takes with on premise infrastructure,” said Antonio Pogliani, head of hosting and managed services at Viatel.
There are many use cases for this newfound agility. Pogliani has customers leveraging it for everything from increasing workforce productivity and data centre consolidation to projects driving cost reduction. “There are companies looking to completely reimagine their business model using modern technologies,” he said.
In his view, Ireland is rapidly becoming a dominant force in cloud computing. “Thanks to a comprehensive strategic approach to develop the sector, cloud adoption is growing faster than the European average and I’m sure will continue to be an area of significant growth as businesses embrace digital transformation programmes and their cloud requirements become more and more complex,” he said.
Pogliani stressed, however, that the cloud should always be treated as the means to an end, rather than the end in itself. He warned that some organisations are going to struggle with the journey. “Many companies find moving from traditional IT services to a cloud-native approach a real challenge, and it significantly impacts critical aspects of their business, including security, costs and even their culture as a company,” he said.
Neither is there a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Viatel is careful to listen to each client’s needs because there are always going to be unique business requirements. “We built our enterprise cloud infrastructure with flexibility in mind to enable the cloud journey that’s right for each customer and whatever their business needs, whether it’s a private or public cloud configuration, on premise, or a combination of them all,” he said.
Fabio Douek, head of cloud delivery at Singlepoint, is seeing similar trends to Pogliani, a greater focus on agility and less on cost savings. “Cost was the main motivation but now it’s a small part of the decision-making process. Today it’s all about agility — it used to take two to six months to get the hardware and create a production environment for a new project; if it’s in the cloud you can do it in a few weeks,” he said.
Attitudes to cloud security are something else that’s changed since the early days of the cloud. Basically, they’ve flipped. “In the beginning, there were a lot of misconceptions and there was an idea that the cloud was somehow weaker than what companies had on premise. Now it’s the other way round,” he said. “In fact, you see companies going to the cloud for specific security requirements like PCI compliance.”
A big part of Douek’s job is consulting with businesses about their cloud strategies. Goals vary enormously from firms going cloud-first who want to re-architect everything on to public and private platforms, to businesses looking to keep core functions on premise and try something new in the cloud.
Engagements usually start with an audit assessment where Singlepoint looks at what infrastructure and applications could be made cloud-ready. A by-product of this process is that 15-20 per cent of servers and systems are typically revealed to be under-used or not used at all. “They’ve been there so long that nobody can remember what they’re for, so cloud migration becomes an opportunity for consolidation,” said Douek.
Audits will usually conclude that between 70-80 per cent of systems and services can be made ready to “lift and shift” to the cloud, depending on their processes. But he stressed that not everything will go, nor should it. He’s worked with financial services that are tied to proprietary infrastructure. “They are running mainframes; systems that in some cases have been around for 30 years and aren’t going anywhere. They see the cloud as place where they can innovate or host new micro services,” he said.
For large companies with lots of legacy, cloud migration is about breaking down monolith systems into micro services. “These are much longer projects, more complex and time-consuming, and we wouldn’t recommend doing all of them in one go,” Douek said. “Moving the integration layer is the catalyst to start migrating everything else.”
[caption id="attachment_417589" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Antonio Pogliani, head of hosting and managed services at Viatel[/caption]
Another change is that cloud service providers like Singlepoint are increasingly called upon to integrate with Amazon Web Services, Azure and Google Cloud. “Most companies used to look for one specific public cloud when they started their journey; now they realise that they don’t want to be dependent on a single provider and their specific technologies,” he added.
Singlepoint advises client to mix it up because different cloud providers have different capabilities. “So you might use AWS for specific workload sand Azure for big data analytics. What you choose to do, and where, may be determined by the need for particular features or it could be influenced by the skillsets you have in house. If you have Microsoft development skills, for example, it might make more sense to go with Azure.”
Douek has no doubt that innovative new cloud solutions will continue to fuel the market and inform migration strategies, but some may take longer to land than others. He believes it’s still early for widespread analytics-as-a-service adoption, even though it’s much easier to analyse data in the cloud than spinning up a data warehouse from scratch.
Another slow burner he identified is contact centres in the cloud. AWS launched a service last year but it’s going to take time to catch on, according to Douek. “A virtual contact centre with phone numbers in different countries is going to be extremely disruptive, but it’ll be hard to convince CEOs to migrate from something they know so well,” he said.
In online accounting, a fast-growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) segment, there is a clear distinction between those that will move to the cloud and those that won’t. “It comes down to age demographics,” said Marc O’Dwyer, CEO of Big Red Cloud. “There is a young market and a mature market.”
He sees a 100 per cent push for cloud-first strategies from people under 30 and more reluctance from older accountants who cling on to what they know. “Younger people don’t want to spend a huge amount of money upfront purchasing equipment or even offices; they’re usually in startups looking for free space and SaaS solutions,” he said. “They’ve grown up on the cloud in the last five to six years and that’s their world.”
By contrast, anyone over 30 will have worked in a world of business where servers and infrastructure were necessary investments and they are still reticent about trusting company data to the cloud. O’Dwyer knows accountants and bookkeepers who use Big Red Book, the original on premise version of Big Red Cloud, who can’t be persuaded to adopt the more agile subscription version, even though it’s the same basic product.
There are, however, signs of a change. “Malware threats and ransomware have persuaded some of them that there may be advantages in moving to secure cloud environments, where providers have thrown more money at security than they ever could,” he said.
It was O’Dwyer’s own experience on a visit to Microsoft’s Dublin data centre, where Big Red Cloud would eventually be hosted, that persuaded him to change his business model and become a SaaS company. “I knew small businesses couldn’t afford to put in the structures and security you get with Microsoft with the amount of money that they pay me,” he said.
Younger customers were never going to need much persuading. He made the point that a generation that has adopted internet banking and regularly shares information about themselves on Facebook is not going to have any security concerns about the cloud. But the same customer demographic is not without its challenges. “They are very demanding,” he said. “They don’t want to have to do the mundane bookkeeping and accounting; they want more automation that allows them to focus on parts of the business that matter more to them.”
Big Red Cloud and other online accounting companies are under pressure to keep adding features that enable customers to get more from a rapidly evolving banking sector. Since the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) came into force in January, mandating that banks share their APIs, accountancy firms are expected to deliver tighter integration.
“Instead of having to enter direct debit details manually, we’re developing a way to make it happen automatically with automatic bank reconciliation. We’re cutting out the basic bookkeeping entries that people have to do,” explained O’Dwyer. “There’s also a demand for pushing invoices though the system with no manual input. Eventually, AI will be operating seamlessly in the background and companies won’t need a bookkeeper.”
O’Dwyer believes the disruption will be significant enough to force accountants to re-educate themselves and offer different business services. He thinks this is why many of them have been reluctant to recommend the cloud to clients. “They realise automation is coming and the endgame is not good for them,” he said.
Other changes are coming to the Big Red Cloud, including the use of “bots” for handling website FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions). “Our competitors offer it so we’ll be providing the options. If a customer is hanging on the phone for more than 30 seconds they can just hit a button and the answer will be automated,” O’Dwyer explained.
The next plan is to add multi-currency functionality and build out the reporting capabilities. Big Red Cloud already provides Book Enquiry, a reporting service that utilises Microsoft’s Power BI to generate different types of analysis from the same data. “Accountants love it because it impresses their clients,” he said.
Further out, O’Dwyer is preparing for the payroll changes that the Revenue will bring in from January next year. All P45s, P60s and P35s will become electronic which means the Revenue will know immediately what’s being paid. “Small businesses will no longer be able to treat the Revenue as a line of credit. They are going to have to use a payroll packages, which is good news for companies like ours that provide them,” he said.
IT services companies like Codec know first-hand how transformational the cloud can be, enabling smaller firms to do things that were impossible before, and allowing larger companies to try something new. “Take an application like Skype for Business,” said Brian Smyth, cloud and platform technical lead. “With traditional infrastructure it would have been quite a big project to deploy and you would have needed a team to maintain it going forward. Now, delivered as a service, you literally check a box.”
SaaS means no more patching servers or sorting out disk failures; in-house teams can focus more on the business and developing new projects. Here, too, the process is much simpler, according to Smyth, who believes the days of building out services, on premise or in the cloud, are almost over. “Sooner rather than later, companies will be consuming more SaaS offerings. The cost models are so good that it doesn’t make sense to build your own any more,” he said.
Smyth has clients that used to rely on vast compute farms for test and development. Now, Codec can spin them something up in the cloud for a fraction of the cost.

Another benefit is the way that the cloud lets companies try different things. Customers are steered towards apps and services from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace where it costs nothing except compute power to experiment.
“You can try out a network scanning appliance, for example, and if you like it and it does what you need, you can buy it. You can fail quickly if doesn’t and move on to something else,” Smyth said.
Is there a danger that it’s too easy to experiment and fail, that multiple projects can distract from core business? “If you’re careful to run environments in a controlled manner, you should be safe,” said Smyth. “What you don’t want is people running around like crazy putting IP on servers that’s publicly exposed. You have to take a look at your permissions and determine who can do what. You have to keep an eye on good governance.”
Now that it’s so easy to activate a new service, it’s not surprising that things sometimes go wrong. Smyth tells the story of a client who accidentally deployed onto an Azure platform in Amsterdam, instead of Dublin.
“It wasn’t a big problem; it worked fine, but it shows you how easy it is to make a mistake,” he said.
Companies don’t always understand the potential for cloud pitfalls, which is why Codec runs workshops to show them the ropes. One lesson is the importance of having a top-down cloud strategy. Another is to nurture a DeVops team.
“One of the main tenets is that you have a lot of people with different skills who cross-pollinate. We’ve seen huge advantages and turned projects around completely using DeVops,” Smyth said.

Back in March, online British accounting firm FreeAgent was bought for £53 million by Royal Bank of Scotland. A pillar bank acquiring a SaaS company speaks volumes about how the sector has been disrupted by cloud service. It’s also an indication of banks fighting back, according to Big Red Cloud’s Marc O’Dwyer.
“Startups like Fire Financial Services and Transfermate are chipping away at banks, hiving off the profitable banking parts, so banks are trying to protect themselves,” he said. “If they partner or acquire an accounting product, they can have access to small business data. They will be able to offer invoice discounts, loans, credit cards — it opens up a whole new ecosystem.”
While O’Dwyer said that there is no sign of his company being bought, he did admit that he was having conversations with banks about partnerships. It’s the latest chapter for a company that transitioned from traditional software distribution to a SaaS model six years ago.
“It took four and a half years to really cement a cloud based-company; we really noticed a difference last October,” he said. “Growing a SaaS business is all about marketing and frontloading the customer acquisition process. You work out what it costs to land a customer, then try to get the length of time to make that customer as profitable as possible, as low as possible.”
Blueface, the cloud-VoIP telephony company, has developed an open API around its unified communications-as-a-service platform, anticipating a new appetite from customers for integration with different applications in the pursuit of even greater collaboration. Joe Roche, head of communications, describes it as a transition from passive to active cloud use.
“Before, demand for cloud-based phone systems was driven by cost, but increasingly it’s because firms want integration. We’re reaching a tipping point where we expect companies to come to us looking to integrate our platform with accountancy packages, CRM and ERP systems,” he said.
Blueface is on a mission to help businesses understand new technologies and specifically how its UC Platform can add value to their existing systems. Application integration is one part of it; facilitating remote working is another.
“The benefits of remote working with hosted UC are clear. Companies can attract, retain and train remote talent in satellite sites. They can also establish new territories remotely and test new markets,” said Roche. “Virtual numbering allows them to make and receive calls from anywhere in the world. They can dial out from an office in Baltimore, Cork, for example, using a Baltimore, MA extension.”
Taking telephony and UC to the cloud frees businesses from “line-dependency”, according to Roche, and being tied to particular premises. An easily managed cloud communications system means companies can achieve a global presence with less equipment and more manageable capital expenditure. “A cloud-first communications infrastructure allows your voice services to grow with your business without system restrictions,” he said.
Data centres are a key component of cloud journeys and their role shows no sign of abating. In fact, the top priorities of CIOs in 2018 are like a checklist of reasons to talk to them: security, GDPR and hybrid IT.
“This is an exciting time to be in the data centre industry, there is a real opportunity for providers to challenge how we manage information to best effect as part of GDPR,” said Tanya Duncan, managing director of Interxion Ireland.
The company’s bespoke cloud access service, Cloud Connect, enables a secure way to connect to multiple, private and public cloud providers. “One developing trend is the move to digital and hybrid cloud, and moving IT infrastructure off-premise,” she said. “Interxion are seeing enterprises moving to the cloud and data centre providers because of requirements around compliance, backup and risk particularly around GDPR and other regulations.”
The central focus for data centre providers, however, is data security. One specific way in which Interxion helps address the challenge of GDPR is in the area of encryption key custody. “We have developed a solution to effectively be the custodian of encryption keys for our customers through the use of hardware security modules,” said Duncan. “This way, the encryption keys are situated in close proximity to, but not within, the cloud.”

From the dull to the dramatic

Highlight: Róisín Kiberd on a volatile process that can catch companies off guard 
Body


There’s a PC game called Papers, Please that was released in 2013, which immerses the player in a bureaucratic, gently-pixelated hell. You play as an immigration officer, working at border control in an imaginary country, ‘Arstotzka’. A succession of immigrants appear at your window; you must process their documents and decide whether or not to let them in, suffering the consequences if you refuse them, or if you take pity and allow in those who lack the correct papers.
It’s a repetitive yet increasingly stressful task: in Papers, Please events can escalate from dull to dramatic in seconds, necessitating vigilance and high-stakes moral decision-making. The game might sound bizarre, or even deliberately boring, but today it is regarded as an indie classic.
In day-to-day life, most of us deal with a very different kind of ‘document security’ to that of Papers, Please, but the process is similarly volatile. In a climate where data breaches, hacks and malware attacks are only increasing, maintaining a consistent, safe and ‘boring’ approach to data security is paramount. Yet under GDPR, finally a reality since May 25, businesses are expected to prepare for the worst, and must make every effort to limit the damage of a data breach — not if, but when it inevitably happens. The contradictions within this challenge — plan to fail, but fail safely — make document security an especially daunting task in 2018.
“While most organisations are conscious of the threat of cybercrime, some can overlook the importance of document security,” said Karen O’Connor, general manager of service delivery at Datapac.
“Modern printers and connected networks are capable of storing large numbers of documents, and unless they are treated like servers or client machines, the print network could end up being the least secure connection in the business.”
[caption id="attachment_417645" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Michael Conway, director of Renaissance[/caption]
Devices in general — including printers, scanners, removable USB sticks and hard drives — often pose an unseen risk to an organisation’s security strategy, with multinationals like IBM even banning removable storage entirely in early May this year. Dr Vivienne Mee, founder of VMGroup and a specialist in cybersecurity and IT forensics, explained that this has long been a problem for larger organisations. “In the financial sector we have seen our clients ban removable media for years now. There are many factors why this was introduced in the financial sector in particular, the predominant one being for data leakage prevention, with malware attacks a close second,” she said. While the ban is inconvenient for some, these drives can easily be replaced with more recent and secure technologies. “There are many other forms of technology out there that can be monitored and maintained correctly that will aid in the transfer of documents, such as encrypted email and secure FTP.”
As ever, security measures applied to computers apply to mobile devices, too, where documents are composed, edited and stored by an increasingly mobile workforce. “Mobile device management also needs to be carefully considered,” said O’Connor.
“If your employees are using their mobile devices for work, make sure that the devices are encrypted and that they employ multi-factor authentication. There should also be processes in place to protect the privacy of all critical business data and documents. A synchronised encryption system that encrypts documents as soon as they are created is advised. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a hacker being able to gain access to confidential documents.”
O’Connor also recommended careful use of access rights management solutions, which can prevent unauthorised users from accessing certain documents without clearance: “This can significantly reduce the risk of sensitive documents falling into the wrong hands and can improve overall document security within an organisation.”
Document security can seem almost impossible given the sheer number of documents stored by the average business in Ireland, and GDPR has only served to highlight the task’s complexities. Your document security strategy should tackle past, present and future data, minimising excess, and refining how information is gathered and stored.
Mee said: “A lot of organisations are realising right now that they have a lot of data, and a lot of it is unclassified data. They cannot just apply a quick data retention policy to cull it down.” Organisation methods are crucial. “Data classification on historic or legacy data is a large project in any organisation of any size. Another problem is that organisations don’t want to just get rid of legacy data for fear they may need it again in the future. I believe that this will be the biggest issue in most organisations, ensuring they are compliant and that they remain compliant, going forward.”
One area businesses should focus on is that of permissions, and access. Putting security measures in place now can limit damage later, protecting your business even if documents are stolen or lost. “Documents rights management, and electronic signatures are what you’ll see a lot of in future, I believe,” said Michael Conway, director of Renaissance.
“We’re seeing better, more sophisticated management of documents, where the user can create a document, encrypt it and send it, and even if they accidentally send it to the wrong person through an autofill error, that recipient won’t have the encryption key so they can’t open it. We’ve nearly all made those autofill errors; this dramatically limits the damage.”
Not only can you encrypt documents in the cloud, or those sent over email — it’s possible to change permissions later, limiting the risk of data loss when staff leave the organisation. Conway explained: “You can give an encryption key to someone and later withdraw it, after their contract expires. In terms of document security, the confidentiality of the document can now be managed, granted and withdrawn, with the person who owns and creates the document in the first place managing rights to its security.”
Documents with electronic signatures are another of the most widely used innovations; most of us will, at some point, have used DocuSign to fill out a digital form. Conway said: “Digital signing of documents and certification of documents is becoming more and more widespread, and there are things like signing hubs and signing programmes and structure which will allow you to create documents and send them to be digitally signed so that the authenticity can be clearly validated.” The technology continues to develop, but the advantages are clear: “A birth cert is one example —you can have one the whole length of your life, but it doesn’t expire. For me to be given a birth cert which expires, because the certificate expires, is stupid. Document signing and digital signing needs to be done properly — you need documents which will not expire.”
[caption id="attachment_417646" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Karen O’Connor, general manager, Datapac[/caption]
Another very obvious and basic measure, but one which is frequently overlooked, is encryption, which often comes built-in with laptops, and can even be sourced online for free. “Any effort to encrypt is better than nothing,” said Mee. “There are even free encryption tools organisations can use if they are unable to invest in enterprise solutions. With such abundance of free and easily obtained encryption software, there is no excuse for organisations not having encryption enabled.”
Some organisations will have misgivings about using the cloud to store documents; they’re rare, but they’re certainly still out there, especially in the public, financial and medical sectors where data is particularly sensitive. But it’s very difficult to halt progress indefinitely, and if you take sufficient security measures the cloud can be the most secure storage of all.
“There are a lot of organisations not using the cloud, due to volume, sensitive data and other factors such as legacy systems in use that cannot be migrated,” said Mee, explaining that although some organisations are right to be cautious, with adequate security measures they can minimise the risks. “The risks associated with cloud are the unknown implementations; sometimes when organisations migrate to the cloud they don’t do any risk assessments, or check that they are fully secure. In addition they may not be breach-ready, meaning they may not have adequate controls in place in order to audit events such as breaches if they occur.”
Conway, too, highlighted that there are safe ways to store and transfer documents in the cloud. “I’m always intrigued by arguments that the cloud is insecure; you can send something in the post and it might be intercepted. It’s a similar level of risk. You can remove the risk by using encryption, so that it can only be opened by the person it’s intended for. Not by others, not even by their PA or secretary.” Conway considers cloud use as an inevitability, but not one that’s especially threatening or disruptive to security standards: “Some organisations pretend they don’t use cloud, but they do. They have to. As an example, accountancy firms can encrypt their documents so that only the recipient can read them, so that even if they get lost in the cloud, they’re still secure.”
May 25 has passed and GDPR is a reality now, but rather than being able to sit back and relax, the challenge is ongoing. Marc O’Regan, chief technical officer of Dell EMC for Britain and Ireland, said: “The interesting thing is that you can’t get a certification for GDPR. You can’t sell a single solution for it either.” Rather, compliance is an ongoing process, necessitating vigilance and organisation. O’Regan explained: “It’s right across the ecosystem, and it’s not prescriptive. Anything relating to any EU citizens, anywhere in the world — it’s not just Europe — will be under this regulation, and if there’s a breach the fines will be significant.”
The most important thing, then, is to show you’ve made an effort should a breach occur: how you protect, store and structure access to your data now might affect how the Data Protection Commissioner views you in future. Mee said: “IT security, and now GDPR initiatives, are pushing awareness and the importance of doing recertification promptly. Elevated privileges will now be questioned, and a carte blanche admin access will no longer be permitted.” Mee also noted that this shouldn’t be news to businesses — rather, your security strategy should have been, and should continue to be, an ongoing practice: “Old data protection laws required IT security measures in place to ensure that data was secure, and it will be the same going forward. IT security should ensure that your perimeter and controls within the organisation prevent intrusion from the outside, as well as infiltration from the inside (infiltration meaning data being sent out in error).”
For many this will also mean confronting tasks which have long been neglected, including that of recertification. Mee said: “Recertification has always been around, as well as ‘mover and leavers’ process, but, due to GDPR, recertification of various user accesses throughout organisations are coming under scrutiny. This task always was put on the back burner in previous years; it was always the manager’s pet hate, and was always the last thing left for people to do when a staff member left or changed teams.”
[caption id="attachment_417644" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Vivienne Mee, founder, VMGroup[/caption]
Where to start? Mee advised a thorough assessment of what data you already have, where and how it is stored, and why: “Start by ensuring that you know where the data is, checking who has access and that it is locked down so it cannot be moved or sent out of the organisation in error. In addition to that, ensure that the storage solution in which the documents are stored is secure.” O’Connor advised anyone currently feeling overwhelmed by the challenges posed by GDPR to consider outsourcing security: “While cybersecurity and GDPR are not one and the same thing, they do go hand in hand. Working with an experienced MSP can help companies to implement technical solutions that contribute to overall organisational GDPR culture and strategy.”
Another option, should the audit be too big and too complicated a job to handle in-house, is to bring in a managed service provider. O’Connor said: “Aligning with a managed service provider (MSP) such as Datapac can help Irish companies to adapt to security challenges by providing access to a range of skills and depth of knowledge that it is typically not feasible to maintain in-house. By focusing their efforts on reducing risk for their customers, MSPs can facilitate the redistribution of in-house resources, helping to add value to a business.”
With document security, a carefully thought-out and consistent approach is what will gain the best results. “It’s not feasible, or realistic, to go to a large-scale organisation and tell them it’s mandated that they have to delete all of their records and data on demand,” O’Regan said. “You can get into an unachievable stream of work. But what you can do is put the measures and practices and technologies in place in preparation for those who exercise the right to be forgotten. The data will still be there, but it goes through a filtration system, and is stopped from exposing them. That, we believe, is good enough for GDPR.”
Branching out beyond its origins as the technology facilitating bitcoin, blockchain stands to overhaul and dramatically improve everyday processes, including document security. Data can be broken up and distributed across networks, decentralised and securely encrypted. Cryptographic signatures can certify authorship, while smart contracts can seamlessly eliminate the need for lawyers and middlemen.
“Blockchain is a really hot property right now, initially because of its relation to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Thinking about blockchain as a distributed database, the fundamental advantage is that it can’t be breached or corrupted. By nature it’s distributed across multiple hosts, and if one piece of that ledger is corrupted then it will be isolated into one part of the chain. It’s only infiltrated at that point, and the ledger remains intact and safe,” said Marc O’Regan, chief technical officer of Dell EMC for Britain and Ireland.
Dell EMC is already exploring the use of smart contracts, which can be automatically activated depending on certain situations. “They’re pretty incorruptible, as a system. Smart contracts distributed by nature, obviously, but more essentially they’re decentralised, which takes out the necessity of a middle man, including a lawyer, a real estate agent or other figures.”
Contracts can be stored securely, using a decentralised system, and remotely accessed by those authorised to do so. O’Regan said: “Any attempts to change the contract can be rejected by all the stakeholders, and all of the stakeholders will be informed. It’s a very transparent system, and very safe.”
Dell Technologies uses blockchain in its logistics supply chain management, introducing automation at various points of the process. The results of experiments conducted in-house are passed along as savings to customers. “On one hand we’re leveraging the technology to reduce costs for our customers, and injecting that back to our customers; and on the other we’re bringing a degree of thought leadership to the market.” Similarly, in terms of managing documents, there are many benefits.
“It can offer a mixture of security, ease of use, extension of monetary value, and the ability to automate processes. We can blend together emerging technologies to help with issues like GDPR, which we’re currently facing,” said O’Regan.

Is mobility heading for mass adoption?

Highlight: Communication in business is all about being contactable and having the information you need at your fingertips, and that’s where enterprise mobility shines. Alex Meehan reports 
Body


When it comes to enterprise mobility, there is a growing move towards democratisation. What was once a technology only accessible to the largest companies is no longer out of reach and pay-as-you-go options are bringing technologies like mobile device management, remote-wipe and mobile cloud security within the reach of all.
“While the term enterprise mobility is common, the truth is that we’re moving away from the era when that was an appropriate label. Today everyone has mobility needs, from the smallest company to the largest, and everyone wants to be mobile, to be able to work remotely and to not have to wait to access that,” said Catherine Doyle, regional sales director for Dell EMC.
“The challenge for smaller companies is matching the resources and efforts that their larger cousins can afford to put into things like security. As any technology becomes more important to a company, the risk associated with depending on it also grows.”
Having a policy on how you use mobility is extremely important, according to Doyle. To begin with, companies can’t assume that one of their employees won’t do something stupid and draw negative attention to their employer.
“This will probably happen and that’s just a fact. Whether it’s on social media or in a public place – somebody will do something that could expose your company to risk. For this reason, you need to have policies around how they use communications technology,” she said.
“Mobility breeds these problems because of the access-anywhere element it brings to your office technology. People get bored, wander off and look at Twitter or Facebook and start liking and sharing things. So you should have a policy of what’s acceptable and not acceptable in the company name.”
At the back end, companies should also have policies on how technology is managed and rolled out. Who owns the technology? Does it belong to the company or is facilitated under a bring your own device (BYOD) scheme? What happens if someone loses a laptop?
“On a mass scale, BYOD is nightmarishly difficult to manage but smaller companies often have efficiencies they can draw on in this area. It’s easier to keep an eye on things in a smaller environment,” said Doyle.
The telecommunications provider Three is fundamentally a facilitator of mobile services but, according to Nicola Mortimer, the company’s business products, marketing and operations head, enterprise mobility is a huge focus for it.
“Being able to use mobile devices as business tools is critical to our customers. Obviously, there are some things you need to enable to get the most out of that process though. The actual devices themselves almost certainly have a lot of inherent capability straight out of the box — smartphones in particular are extremely advanced now,” she said.
“But in addition to that, there are security measures and collaboration tools that we can help bring to the fore for companies using these devices as working tools. That starts with mobile device management, which should be the bare minimum for any company that is security conscious.”
Mobile device management brings an additional layer of enterprise-class security to mobile devices, most notably with the ability to remotely wipe the device if it is lost or stolen.
“GDPR is now in effect, so people are more aware of their responsibilities in this area going forward. You have to guard your data properly. This is something that companies do need to consider if they’re delivering the ability to work from any device and from any place to their staff,” said Mortimer.
There is a growing trend towards allowing mobile working by urban Irish companies, fuelled in part by rising property prices. While most companies would love to put their offices in the centre of a major city, the cost of property is forcing them to the outskirts instead.
Commuting times can be difficult to manage for some staff, so the ability to work from home a few days a week or work on the client’s site is attractive. But to do it properly, staff need the right equipment.
“Increasingly, we’re seeing companies interested in offering their staff work spaces rather than work places — in other words, facilitating them working wherever suits them rather than in an office,” said Mortimer.
“There are a number of trends pushing that ahead — one is the power of the devices that are on offer. You can do a lot more with the average device now than you used to be able to. You don’t need a top of the range laptop, tablet or smartphone to have access to great technology.”
[caption id="attachment_417575" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Brian Smyth of Codec[/caption]
In addition, having a single management platform that works independently of whatever devices are used to log on to it is very helpful. This is becoming known as unified end point management, and it stands in contrast to mobile device management.
“We’re not fully there yet, but that’s where we’re going. As working away from the office and its heavy-duty IT security becomes more common, that unified end point management is going to become more of an issue,” said Mortimer.
According to Michele Neylon of Blacknight Solutions, the drop in prices and increase in capability of mobile technology are combining to make enterprise mobility more and more common amongst Irish companies.
“When it comes to mobile access to the workplace, you can do it a lot more safely and securely than you used to be able to a few years ago. For example a very high percentage of our clients are pursuing a mobile-first approach to their use of technology,” he said.
“They’re responding to emails and requests for interaction with clients on their mobile devices on the road. The day of people working in offices sitting statically in front of desktop machines are numbered.”
Several of Blacknight’s staff, including Neylon, routinely work remotely, which means that the company has had to roll out a management strategy to accommodate that.
“There are certain things you have to do. If a laptop is stolen, for example, you have to know if the hard drive is encrypted? If not, why not? Can you wipe mobile phones and other devices remotely? Yes or no? It’s not that complicated but if you don’t have the right tools in place, it’s a problem,” he said.
“Some things don’t even cost much money. Privacy filters on laptops, for example. Not all corporate information should be easily viewable over your shoulder in a Starbucks or other public place by just anyone walking past. A privacy filter restricts the viewing angle your device can be seen from.”
Likewise, there are commonsense aspects of good enterprise mobility.
“You’d be amazed at what you overhear in airport lounges and other public places with people having very loud business conversations on their mobile phones. That doesn’t require a technology solution — just some common sense. Don’t broadcast your company’s business to all and sundry,” said Neylon. “Overall though, the drop in prices in this kind of technology has been marvellous. If you go back ten years or so, setting up a virtual private network (VPN) to provide for secure online communications cost a lot of money. You had to have expensive hardware, expensive software and expensive licenses to make it all work. There were maintenance costs to keep it all running and you needed to have a level of technical know-how to get the most out of it.”
Fast forward to today, and many of these tools cost a lot less money. “They’re significantly cheaper, they’re easier to manage, they’re easier to install, set up and run. The cost has come right down and it’s not as hard to do as it was. Yes, there are greater security issues that come with greater ease of access to mobility, but the upsides dramatically outweigh the downs,” said Neylon.
So, for people in the market selling mobility solutions, a key question is how best to move the industry on.
[caption id="attachment_417577" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Nicola Mortimer, marketing and operations head of Three[/caption]
“Honestly, most Irish companies have been using elements of enterprise mobility for years, although providers who are now entering the market are keen to umbrella the term,” said Brian Dervan, head of enterprise for Blueface.
“Some businesses have been offering mobile through soft clients, bring your own device schemes and some through the use of hot desking — but the key difference now is control. Visibility of communications architecture in particular is becoming far less complicated thanks to software-driven, beautifully designed infrastructure.”
More than ever, businesses know how their system works and can measure the extra advantages that enterprise mobility brings to the table. According to Blueface’s research, the majority of Irish business people use three to four devices regularly, but it can be argued that these devices are not part of an overarching strategy.
“Businesses have relied upon various different communications tools such as desk phones, mobile phones, fax machines and emails in the past and failure to manage this with a realistic BYOD policy can cause significant productivity disruptions,” said Dervan.
As businesses brace for stricter legislation on how data is stored and accessed, if a company doesn’t have a device strategy, productivity may be the least of its problems.
“Companies should begin their transition into clever device management the same way any idea should be adopted. Start by auditing your current infrastructure, choosing what works and what doesn’t going forward,” said Dervan.
As 2020’s PSTN shut-down approaches, this will usually include the virtualisation of physical hardware. Out with an on-premise PBX, in with a soft PBX running on a server.
“I think the key to sensible device management is education. Rather than introducing a load of new devices or technologies, educate staff on forthcoming changes, and maybe even elect change champions and ensure the system you choose matches your business needs,” said Dervan.
[caption id="attachment_417578" align="alignright" width="465"] Brian Dervan, head of enterprise for Blueface[/caption]
“IP telephony has existed for quite some time as a seemingly clunky alternative to line-based telephony. Through the proliferation of familiar hardware, the oncoming IP-migration and an enhanced broadband infrastructure, IP telephony and unified communications are becoming the business standard.”
Meanwhile, the shifting of cost from capital to operating expenditure in the explosion of cloud technologies — the pay as you go approach — is also having an effect on how enterprise mobility is being rolled out in the market.
“This has been an important factor: companies are moving to monthly pay-as-you-go bills for many of their IT services. They’re looking at security around mobile devices a little bit more because the cost is becoming more palatable. In the past, it cost extra to secure these devices, but increasingly it’s baked into the software that’s available,” said Simon Sharkey, sales and marketing director with Westcoast Ireland.
“In particular for SMEs that’s a factor. If they have to pay extra for a standalone piece of security software for their laptops, they’re less likely to do it — they’ll take their chances without it. If it’s included in an overarching security product, that’s a different matter.”
Developments like this are driving awareness among companies of all sizes in Ireland.
“Enterprise size businesses have a culture of maintaining security, but medium businesses often don’t have the same diligence. That’s improved dramatically in recent years but as you get down to smaller-type businesses, things can be a bit hit and miss. The onus is often on managed service providers to tell them they have to do this,” said Sharkey.
“They have to be educated to know that this is just sensible digital hygiene. It might not be a problem today, but it could be a significant problem tomorrow and it just makes sense to mitigate against it. There’s still quite a learning curve there because the mindset is different.”
The company could have significant turnover of €20 million but, according to Sharkey, it might still resent having to invest in disaster recovery and mobile security.
“People want to spend as little as they can, but the question is what’s appropriate. At least the fact that these security components are coming bundled with other applications and systems is a good thing,” he said.
While security used to be done at the perimeter of the company network, the increasing adoption of cloud technology is making that approach redundant, says Brian Smyth, platform practice lead at Codec.
“Back in the day, the way of keeping data safe was to erect barriers around your technology, keeping bad guys outside. Today, though, data is kept in the cloud and can literally be anywhere, so mobile security has to be more about identity management rather than perimeter management,” he said. “Wherever your data goes, your security should go with it so your security is mobile.”
Smyth offers the example of a file server full of documents. The traditional method of keeping that safe is to put it behind a barrier so only people who can get through can see the files. But there are problems with this approach — not least of which is that once someone is through the perimeter, you largely lose control of what they can do with the data.
“That was okay back before cloud computing, but now people use products like Sharepoint Online, so users can access data from anywhere using mobile devices. They no longer need to be in the building anymore. So it’s become more important to be able to tell that the person accessing the data is who they say they are,” said Smyth. “That way it doesn’t matter where the data is or what device it’s being accessed from. This is the sensible approach to enterprise mobility security.”
It’s a mistake to put in enterprise mobility solutions that don’t allow clients and third parties equal access. That’s the message from Mark Evans, managing director of Welltel’s enterprise division, who goes on to say that the Irish market in particular has different mobility needs to the US and elsewhere.
“Companies have made mistakes here by putting in mobility solutions that only work within the enterprise. They have mobility and can communicate well within the enterprise but what we’ve found is that people want to be able to communicate with any device and with anyone,” he said.
“Some applications are designed for very large enterprises in the US that only talk to each other. Even a big company in Ireland is a few thousand people and in general, companies here are a lot smaller. But they want to have the same ease of access in communications with their customers, suppliers, staff and anyone internally that needs to talk to each other.”
There is also a move towards companies facilitating bring your own device (BYOD) programmes — many find that staff want to be able to supply their own device and companies don’t want the hassle of managing a fleet of devices.
“They want to be able to just deploy an app and let staff use whatever device they want,” said Evans.
Welltel puts in complete communications systems, from phone systems to entire call centres, with everything in the middle — from webchat to mobility, to phone calls to email and more.
“The ability to work remotely is a huge driver for Irish companies. That’s growing all the time as companies discover that it’s a lot cheaper to work remotely and work increasingly becomes something you do rather than somewhere you are,” said Evans.
“Now people work more than they used to, and they want more flexibility in how they do that.”

Keeping it Automated

Highlight: Quinton O’Reilly speaks to Gary Cullen of Provident CRM about improving the customer journey 
Body


From our perspective, marketing alone doesn’t really achieve a whole lot, it’s just like shouting into a room and hoping someone will notice you,” says Gary Cullen, the sales and marketing director for Provident CRM.
“Whereas we built it into the customer journey so it becomes a permanent part of the conversation you’re having with customers. Not only working out how to attract visitors to your site or product, but also nurturing and maintaining that relationship. We see it as part of the customer journey.”
While the customer journey from intent to purchase has changed thanks to the sheer number of channels brands can interact on, so too has the ways in which businesses guide them.
Accompanying the many different developments in CRMs is the growth of marketing automation, which allows automation to deal with repetitive tasks like email or social media.
As Cullen mentions, relying on it alone isn’t conducive to good marketing so it treats it as part of the overall customer journey. Getting businesses to adopt the mindset needed to do this effectively, however, can be a challenge.
“When you look at what they’re trying to achieve, a lot of it can be straightforward but to shift the way they think [is hard],” he says. “A lot more thought and planning has to go into how we’ll deliver these messages because now there’s multiple channels, multiple platforms, you can have AI and machine learning can be driving a lot of what’s happening in the background.
“You have to be a bit more savvy about what you’re trying to achieve.”
The element of AI and machine learning is becoming more of a talking point within these circles thanks to the technology being more readily available now. It’s something Salesforce has been working on with its latest AI platform, Einstein, and for Paul Smith, its executive vice-president for Cloud Sales EMEA, the purpose is to help businesses market smarter.
“A lot of what we’re focusing on with Einstein is making things easy, so making AI manifest itself in practical things for a business,” says Smith. “When people talk to me about what are you doing differently, it’s a bit like IoT as well.
“AI and IoT, they’re only valuable if they prompt someone or something to perform an action that would otherwise not have happened. With AI it’s providing that intelligence that Vicki was at the sales forecast recently.
“I spent probably a day and a half forecasting a sales business and if I can rely on Einstein guidance to cut that time down to an hour of just reviewing those numbers, then I get a day of my life back.”
Much of this isn’t possible unless you have the right kind of data to work with. Marketing is heavily dependent upon good data, and that can involve numerous attempts at broadcasting things like newsletters and comparing them.
“The measurements are an issue, you have to consistently measure and consistently provide that feedback because you’re never going to get it exactly right,” says Cullen. “Even with the best in the world, there’s always room to take your feedback, put it back in, do all your analysis then compare.
Much of the success of tools like marketing automation greatly depend on the ecosystem or structure that surrounds it. It’s no good taking a tool off the shelf if you don’t have the data and supports needed to make the most of it, and Cullen warns against treating it as a silver bullet.
“From our point of view, these tools shouldn’t be seen as a standalone tool or in isolation,” he says. “If you’re using one of these tools, it has to integrate as seamlessly as possible with either a CRM or ERP or somewhere where your customer data is centralised because it’s not just good enough to say we market and we’ll get prospects.
“Once your other team members are engaged with those prospects, their other channel is following them, an employee sends a direct personal email and the reaction from that email feeds back into your measurements. You can’t just say we sent out stuff every month and 300 people opened the email, it’s not good enough.”
Having that information is vital as the more you have, and the more you can recognise patterns, the easier it is to adapt to any changes in a situation.
Speed is key and being savvy enough to know, as Smith says with Einstein.
“That’s the nuance I would give around Salesforce, around Einstein and analytics is that it’s very much giving the user that intelligence to take very quick actions,” he says.
“Rather than having to analyse the problems, Einstein already says here’s a recommendation on how to take action.”
The main thing to note is that for anyone who embarks on a marketing automation strategy, it’s going to be a long-term project.
Cullen says that it takes a few months to see a change in how you’re marketing, as you learn from your attempts and discover what works best for your business.
“The marketing automation strategy is long term and we all start at pretty much the same point which is a broadcast,” he explains.
“Then we start to refine and we start to see where we’re gaining the most traction.
“Generally individuals that we’re talking to have multiple channels that they operate in, everyone has a Twitter account, everyone has a Facebook page, you may or may not have liked something on Facebook, but you might react depending on the context.
“What we have to do is look at all of these different channels, send content out and then measure and refine and measure and refine.
But it is something that does take an amount of time, you should, after six months, be seeing a change in what you’re doing, what the message is between the different channels and the different products, you might find one doesn’t work well on Twitter but does better on Instagram,” Cullen says.
“You have to tailor or cut your cloth based on the channel that you have and the messaging you’re putting out, but it does take time.”

Surviving the maelstrom?

Highlight: Keeping the wheels of commerce greased means having IT systems up and running at all times. But is there more to business continuity planning than IT? Jason Walsh finds out 
Body


Disaster recovery can sound rather overdramatic: yes, disasters do occur, whether it be earthquakes, volcanoes or mass-scale terrorist attacks. The thing is, they don’t tend to happen very much in Ireland. Thinking about the word disaster on another scale, though, does suggest that the potential for a crisis is nonetheless very real: certainly, a business being unable to operate is rarely a disaster in the normal sense — but it can be a disaster for the business.
The answer is to have a plan for when crises do strike, be that a fire and evacuating a building or, as we saw last year, extreme weather making commuting a near-impossibility.
Business continuity planning (BCP), then, must be about more than straightforward disaster recovery (DR) and backups, essential as those components are.
Michael Conway, managing director of IT security provider Renaissance, said that a serious plan for business continuity has a simple concept at its core: keeping the show on the road.
“Business continuity is an awful lot more than disaster recovery and backup. At its fundamental, it’s all about being in a position to run the organisation during a major business interruption. That’s it in a nutshell,” he said.
The unofficial motto of the US Postal Service — ‘Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds’ — is a rather lovely piece of poetry, but is it practicable for other businesses?
Conway said that, in Ireland at least, weather events are the acid test as they are the most common form of disaster.
“Remember the weather events last year? It’s keeping the shop open, keeping the show on the road.”
This is more achievable than ever, he said — though the extent to which the show can go on depends on what the show actually is.
“In our business here, we moved offices about 18 months ago. Our account system is in the cloud, our email is in the cloud, our CRM is in the cloud, and our phone system is in the cloud. We can actually shut the door and continue operations. Yes there are limitations: you cant receive deliveries. Where you have processing, where you have paperwork, it can be a little challenging.
“The real challenges are in organisations where people need to be in a specific place; for example, in retail food or in manufacturing. You have a supply chain to address; it’s your goods, your staff and so on,” he said.
Finding out just where a business lies on this continuum is the first thing Renaissance addresses when advising on and developing business continuity plans.
We go in and ask: ‘what are the showstoppers?’ Typically people need to deliver the goods to the customer and collect payment for them. That’s it at its most basic level, whether it’s hotel beds or pints of Guinness.
“Technology is an underlying core part of how we organise businesses these days, so if you lose email it is a bigger interruption than it used to be in the past. Technology is not the core issue, though. It’s an important issue, yes, but you need to get the other elements right. It’s about people and it’s about processes.
“Life is about these things. There is no silver bullet,” he said.
[caption id="attachment_417613" align="alignright" width="625"] Darragh Canavan, sales director at Datastring[/caption]
For those businesses not entirely dependent on location, the answer is to have a plan in place to allow for decentralised working.
“Connectivity has become ubiquitous and the workforce is more and more mobile,” said Darragh Canavan, sales director at online backup and cloud storage provider Datastring.
But connectivity alone is not enough. Datastring, which aims primarily at small and medium businesses but scales up to enterprise level, said that looking outside your own organisation is often essential.
“You should have an outside partner, even if just for the expertise. Perhaps larger multinationals [will] have a large internal IT department; okay, fine, but even there it can land on someone who is too busy or unprepared.
“Outsourcing regardless of the size can be a very good idea,” he said.
Datastring’s key point when talking to customers is to explain that backup is not a magic pill: recovering from backed-up files and folders still could mean days when the business is not fully operational.
“It used to be just backups, [but] it’s become much more than that recently,” said Canavan.
“Server availability is the key term that a lot of people use. If a system goes down there is a failover, whether that’s in-building or in the cloud. You can even have the two together.”
Canavan said that one change is that permanently rented back-up sites are in less demand, primarily thanks to the effect cloud computing has had, not only on disaster recovery, but on wider business continuity planning.
“DR-as-a-service is very much pertaining to the IT systems, but continuity planning has so much more to it: phones, desks, where you can send people if the site is physically threatened. Connectivity has reduced the need for a turnkey back-up hot-site. Staff can be sent home, or to a hotel and we provision for their access,” he said.
Daren Howell, proposition marketing manager at Sungard Availability Services, said that business continuity has changed quite radically in the last ten years — primarily in that progressive businesses are building resilience into everyday operations.
“It’s gone from being a reactive approach to a business problem or disaster, to being pre-planned to keep the business running.”
In practice this means, to paraphrase The Simpsons, looking not at crises, but ‘crisitunities’. It sounds glib, but there is a point: when things do happen, they provide an opportunity to learn important lessons about how the business actually runs.
“Some of the more enlightened people within the industry are talking about not just surviving the incident, but thriving: exploiting it and coming back out the other side and being far more resilient.
“It’s a very good discipline for taking a very good, hard look at your business and understanding what processes are really important. You focus on those areas where you create value and growth; you protect them and nurture them,” he said.
For Howell, the question of readiness in the face of disaster is not primarily a technical one. At times IT provision may resemble plumbing — an essential background component of daily life. On the other hand, it is sometimes seen as centre in its own right. In truth, though, it is there to support the business.
“It’s about knowing your people and processes: if a process goes down, do you you know to get it back?” he asked.
As an example, he said that you have all of the technology that you want, but if you don’t know how to get people back on track it will all be for nothing.
“People come to recovery centres, but [you can run into problems if] there’s no staff there to direct and guide the recovery of the organisation. Whenever we conduct a business continuity test or crisis management test, even the most seasoned professionals can freeze in the headlights. It takes some forethought and planning — and some personal decisiveness — to drive the whole process forward,” he said.
Catherine Doyle, regional sales director for enterprise at Dell EMC, said that the concept of business continuity can at times be ill-defined.
“It really depends on who you are talking to. The first thing is that business continuity is business continuity. IT is a segment of that business continuity, of course,” she said.
Doyle agreed with the others that a serious business continuity plan cannot simply be a question of technology, but also noted that some technologies can have a transformative effect.
Dell EMC tiers the service that it provides, breaking them down in terms of ‘mission critical’, ‘business critical’ and ‘business supporting’. Internal processes at Dell EMC, providing the company’s own BC and DR plans, feed into this.
“We ourselves, each quarter, look at what could happen — and walk our customers through it too.
“New techniques and technologies, such as Symmetrix remote data facility (SRDF) and storage resource management (SRM), are key facilitators on the technical side, but technical matters can also help smooth out human processes.
“Those allow us to failover. The other important thing from a DR point of view is to make it as automated as possible. We have found in the past that, as soon as humans are involved, people try to delay and move it up the management chain, whereas if there’s a service level agreement in place, it’s much smoother,” she said.
Complex systems, too, are supported on the technical side in surprisingly straightforward ways. The use of flash/SSD storage, for instance, has dramatically reduced recovery times where data-intensive applications are at work.
“The speed of database rebuilding and so on is much faster. It’s absolutely game-changing,” she said.
Dell EMC’s own move towards remote working is part of the company’s strategic continuity planning, and this, again, is facilitated by technology: internally the organisation uses Skype for Business as its telephony platform, both on-prem and off-prem.
“So, for example, one of the key things is that Michael [Dell] has told Dell that we will have 50 per cent remote working by 2020. That doesn’t mean everyone [who can will] work from home, but it does mean they are capable of it.
“With Windows 10 on the laptops and Microsoft OneDrive, their documents are seamlessly held for them from device-to-device, and it’s the same document,” she said.
The wider move to cloud technologies is, of course, the greatest facilitator of this kind of strategy.
“IDC talks about first, second and thirdparadigms: mainframe, server and cloud. The good thing about cloud is the resilience is built into the software, as opposed to the hardware.”
In the end, though, some companies are planning for disaster because they have to: the regulatory stick being as important as, perhaps more important, than the carrot of keeping profits flowing.
“The regulated companies take it [the most] seriously, because of the risk. Definitely we see it more than anywhere else,” said Doyle.
One side of continuity that has improved dramatically in recent years is the ability to provision failover, including automatic failover, thanks to IT developments including virtualisation and cloud computing. “Back to the early days, it was dramatically different,” said Dell EMC’s Catherine Doyle.
If you wanted to do DR, we’d have had an [IBM] AS/400 on-site and an AS/400 off-site, Windows PCs on-site and Windows PCs off-site. They had to be literally identical,” she said.
Several failures in the still-mainframe-centric banking sector in the last decade underscore this: in such set-ups, one thing being wrong can knock out an entire business.
“With the advent of virtualisation that has radically changed. You no longer have to have that hardware sitting there doing absolutely nothing, [just] waiting for the disaster to happen.”
Michael Conway of Renaissance agreed. The more office-based a business is, the less it needs warm bodies in the office, but in all cases, he said, IT has become a central focus of all businesses.
“Happily, the IT component of continuity planning, primarily disaster recovery, was more complex 20 to 30 years ago [than it is now]. We have better connectivity, fibre and so on, and there can be standby servers,” he said.
Daren Howell, of Sungard Availability Services, said that a false concept continues to hold sway today: that you can just throw a disaster recovery application at the problem and that will fix everything — and, ironically, this problem is exacerbated by some of the technological developments that have done so much to smooth IT processes in recent years.
“This is part of the wider methodology of cloud computing, wherein people think everything’s in the cloud so everything is okay. It’s not always the case; in fact it’s rarely the case. You have to put systems in place to recover that cloud environment,” he said.

The Scarcity Principle

Highlight: As highly skilled candidates in IT are now a rare commodity, IT recruiters are adapting to a new reality where every advantage counts, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body


Finding the right talent in the IT industry is becoming a more difficult task by the day. As more and more companies transform from traditional into tech companies, thanks to the demands of the market, IT skills are at a premium.
While that is great news for those with the relevant skills, it presents a significant challenge for companies as there’s a shortage of talent to go around.
More and more are relying on IT resourcing companies to help plug the gap, but that’s a major challenge for a number of reasons.
“At the moment, it’s the lack of available experienced IT talent in the market,” said Niamh O’Connor, the talent acquisition manager at Singlepoint. “There are very few people who are readily available or actively looking. Most are engaged in some sort of project or full-time employment and are not actively looking, so you’re now in a case of being on the back foot.
“People are not applying for roles any more, it’s more unique to know your network and know when to reach out at the right time to someone. It’s no longer about putting a job up on the job boards and hoping someone will apply because you’ll get very few applications that are the type of people you’re looking for because they’re already actively engaged.”
It’s a similar challenge that Jason McNeill, the sales director at Vantage Resources, sees across not just in Ireland, but at a global level. Regardless of whether it’s B2B or B2C, consumers expect faster and more responsive services. If they don’t get it from you, they’ll move elsewhere. Hence the demand for proper IT services.
[caption id="attachment_417650" align="alignleft" width="598"] Jason McNeill, sales director, Vantage Resources[/caption]
“Any company you deal with, you want things to happen [quickly], whether it’s booking a flight or anything else,” he said, “as we’re getting busier in our lives and as we’re more and more intolerant of things not working.
“That’s what companies are afraid of, if their service isn’t working, the customer will go to the next company. All of this is driving digital transformation and all over company recruitment companies, our challenge is working with our class to help them find those people that will transform their business.
“Sometimes people think IT people work in IT companies. If you take one of the big accountancy practices in Dublin, they don’t just hire accountants, they hire legal people, they hire IT people as well.”
Part of the challenge is engaging these people in a way that isn’t through the traditional means. O’Connor says that most people can spot a recruiter a mile away and would be reluctant to engage, whereas chatting with a friend or another person in the same line of work is preferable.
“It’s a real challenge and we’re using a lot of our internal network so we’d be using those guys to go out to meet-ups and industry events to talk to people,” she said. “Because you can spot a recruiter from a mile off, there’s no point in me or my recruiters going out and talking the IT talk.
“A lot of companies are starting to put the responsibility on the team to help find people. Something like looking on LinkedIn or going to these meet-ups and having conversations because, at the moment, the technology or the type of project that we’re delivering is what someone is interested in, that’s the first thing to get the hook in.
“Then behind it is everything else that comes with it. The career, the training, the progression, but those initial conversations are not necessarily from a recruiter point of view regarding what you want to do or why you want to move, what are you working on.
“Enticing them constantly rather than them coming to you looking for a job because it just doesn’t happen any more.”
One of the more significant problems with recruitment in the IT space is the shortage of qualified professionals in fields like data science.
McNeill mentions how the demand for specific skillsets has transformed in recent years, going more from general IT skills to more specialised areas like data science, analytics and infrastructure.
“Data science is one of these areas that wouldn’t really have existed a number of years ago, but now it’s very much a standalone topic in itself,” he said.
“Unfortunately, there’s not enough people, so the colleges are playing catchup and there are people who are doing conversion courses that are on offer, getting people into data analytics. That is a massive area and very troublesome to source.
“Infrastructure has grown over the past number of years, and it’s one of the areas that has been rising where companies haven’t spent money on the infrastructure, just trying to make things okay – ‘we’ll get through’. But people are spending money on infrastructure, putting more stuff into the cloud, remote working, just having the infrastructure.”
Since there is a shortage of people to fill these roles, those who have the skills can be more selective about where they work. It’s not just the job itself, but the environment, the culture and the people they’re working alongside that’s important.
“Culture is a huge thing so when we’re looking at teams and the type of teams clients are looking for, the culture fit is a big thing for us,” said O’Connor “That’s the other hard part, with IT people, you sometimes have developers who are not always client facing, but also we need that person to be able to sit down with a client and walk them through exactly what they are doing.
“We’re constantly looking for that ability to engage with clients and help them out, so everyone going out has to be wearing that client hat rather than saying I’m a developer or project manager delivering.
“It is getting that personality fit, and attitude is a huge thing, as it keeps or it causes people not to stay on in a company because if they feel like they’re not fitting in or feel like it’s not the right type of environment they want to be in, they’re not going to stay and given the market, they [find other offers quickly].”
This is the case with newer and more innovative solutions such as those that CPL offers. As part of its offering, one of its solutions called Apollo uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help its consultants find the right people for roles.
It’s not used as a way to replace them, but to complement the work they already do, spotting potential candidates that may have been missed through other methods.
“Apollo takes the one-and-a-half million candidates that we have, the 120,000 we placed on it, and we teach it success and failure, said Kevin Sweeney, IT director for CPL. “We train Einstein (Salesforce’s AI offering) once a month, so we give it the full data set and we give it the successes and failures and then that effectively allows us to give an inherent value for every item on that candidate record.
“What you’re trying to find is candidates that we’re missing, so our consultant may have it in our head that this person is quite good, the model may say you have double the rate of success if that candidate has previously worked in IBM or Visor or whatever so that’s what it does. It gives an inherent value to every data item we feed it.”
Sweeney mentions that it’s not a way to automatically pick suitable clients from a list, but to add more for consideration.
“We’re not automatically picking directly from that, but we’re feeding it directly to consultants for consideration so please consider these people as well,” he said. “A person may not have gone in front of the right person at the right time.”
Among the many shifts that have occurred in this space is the dynamic between recruiter and worker. In this case, it’s the companies who are on the back foot as high-skilled workers hold all the cards.
“It’s funny because when I first started in recruitment, you would interview the candidate and you were making a decision from the other side of the table, asking is this the right person for the team?” said O’Connor.
“Whereas now it’s gone almost 80:20 where the candidate is interviewing you because they want to know if you’re the right company to work with; if you’re the right company that’s going to help me progress my career; what is your environment, values, mission statement, and we get asked those questions all the time in interviews.”
[caption id="attachment_417651" align="alignright" width="498"] Kevin Sweeney, IT director for CPL[/caption]
There is a good reason for this though. Very rarely does the job you end up doing match exactly what’s required in the job description, so IT professionals want more than just a job, they want something they can be proud of.
“People want to be properly engaged and properly informed about what they’re going to work on. Too many people have been burned by ‘I was told this in the interview’ and they start in the role and then six months later, they’re doing a different role, something they didn’t really want to do,” said O’Connor.
“People take a lot of pride in their career, [and] if they feel they won’t get what was promised to them in the interview, they’ve no problem moving.”
It’s something that McNeill also sees in his role too, with the speed in which you can complete tasks like putting together a job spec, reviewing CVs, organising interviews and getting good, honest feedback in a short space of time is paramount.
“It’s a two-way street. If you’re an IT person out there, you’re not just talking to one agency or one company, you’re talking to maybe half a dozen and people have multiple offers,” he said. “We work with our clients hand in hand and build trust in our relationship so we understand what the client wants, the type of skills and person they want as well.
“Their process, how clean and quick they can make it [is important as] . . . it’s all about speed because these clients are competing.
“When a person goes in, the company is interviewing the client, but the client is also interviewing the company, ‘do I want to work here?’.”
The other element that O’Connor mentions is that the leave-notice period for employees is increasing. As it’s very difficult to replace a high-skilled person or a role with a major amount of responsibility, these are being pushed out to eight or 12 weeks for this so they can cope.
“If they were to walk away, or walk away within four weeks, you wouldn’t be able to get a handover, which again is pushing it out,” she said. “Also, we try to limit our interview process, but a lot of them take three or four weeks, which coupled with a notice period, is then pushing that start date out.”
For now, the onus will be on IT recruiters and companies to treat the search for IT professionals as a long-term project. Combining that with newer ways of recruiting, like CPL’s Apollo product, will play a role in helping companies uncover talent that might have been missed the first time around.
“If [clients are] finding new candidates that they never saw before, I would be worried because the model’s not right,” said Sweeney. “One of the first tests for the model was recruiters saying you’ve given me a list of 100 candidates, I recognise 20 because they’re good people, and we want to hear that, and here’s another ten or 20, if they came out of the same engine they must be good.
“What we need to do is give that person to the consultant and in one phonecall say actually there’s no fit there at all and that’s why we’re a long way from ‘I have a job description, offer three jobs’. I can’t see it in my lifetime.”

There can’t be too many senior executives in the Irish motor trade who look back on 2013 with anything approaching fondness. New car sales were down 7 per cent that year, on top of an 11.5 per cent fall in 2012. Dealerships were shutting down and jobs were being lost as the sector attempted to cope with the catastrophic effects of the recession.
But for Paddy Magee, 2013 saw the first steps on a path which he believes has led to Renault Ireland becoming a sustainable business.
“We were at 6 per cent market share, so the only way was up,” he says. “When we looked at our business model, it was obvious to us that we had to reduce the size of our network. If we didn’t, we were going to lose good people. So the plan was very simple: we wanted fewer dealers selling more cars.”
Magee, who had only taken up his position as managing director of the company in June of that year, has since overseen a cut in the number of Renault dealers nationwide from 40 to 28. It was a drastic reduction but, given the importance of the relationship that customers have with car dealers in Ireland, Magee believes it was essential.
“In Europe, car buyers place a huge amount of importance on the brand they buy, but in Ireland, it’s all about the dealer. People will buy from the dealer who has looked after them for 20 years, who dropped a replacement car around to them when their own was banjaxed, who always gave them a good deal. Because of that, I need our dealers to be happy, and to have a sustainable business,” he says.
“We have 28 dealers now, we’ll add another two, but that’s it. I’d be selling more cars if I had 35 of them, but I wouldn’t have as profitable a network. I reckon we have one of the best relationships in the country with our dealers. Is every day beautiful? No. But we’ve been through tough times together and come out the other end, and that makes a difference.”
One of the first questions I ask Magee is the obvious one: has he always loved cars? The answer is no. “People always assume that you’re in this business because you love cars, but I got into it because Iked the industry,” he says.
“None of my family was in the trade, but I’d met some nice people who were involved in it when I was in college in Bolton Street, and then I did a thesis with the company that was the main Volkswagen dealer in Ireland at the time. They asked me to come in to work with them during the summer, then I joined them full-time after I graduated.”
He joined Renault Ireland in 2002, taking the top job 11 years later. That year, the business sold 5,500 vehicles and had revenues of €88 million; last year, its most successful to date, sales were over 15,500 and turnover was €208 million.
“The market was up 78 per cent in those four years, but we were up 170 per cent, and there’s a few reasons for that,” he says. “Renault went through a renaissance in terms of product – for years, the Clio was our bulletproof car, but then we got into SUVs with the Kadjar and the Captur, and they flew for us.”
Another contributing factor has been Dacia. The Romanian carmaker was acquired by Renault in 1999, and its models have been sold here since 2013.
“It was the right time,” Magee says. “Affordability was the key message back then, so for people to be able to come in and buy something like a 1.5-litre Diesel Duster for under €20,000 was perfect.”
The dealers were amazed, he says, to see some customers of retirement age trading in models from Mercedes and Jaguar for a “no bells and no whistles” Dacia. “They’d had company cars for years, but once that was all finished, they just wanted something economical and safe. It was a bit like Lidl and Aldi: years ago, people wouldn’t have been seen dead shopping in them, but now it’s a badge of honour.”
The goal had been to put 10,000 Dacias on Irish roads by the end of this year. The day before our meeting, Magee had checked his figures, and found they had reached 18,500.
Between them, the two brands had a 9.2 per cent share of the combined new car and van market at the end of April. That month, new car sales rose in Ireland for the first time in over a year, according to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (Simi), although sales for the year were still down, by 4.68 per cent.
Perhaps surprisingly, given the negative coverage they have received over the past while, diesel vehicles still accounted for 56 per cent of all new car sales, according to the Simi figures. That’s a drop of 10 per cent on the same time in 2017, but Magee says it reflects the fact that for many drivers, diesel is still the number one choice.
“I’ve seen ads claiming that ‘diesel is dead’, and to be honest they make me laugh,” he says. “You are never going to convince someone living down in Clare or west Cork or wherever that a hybrid or an electric car is for them. It’s just not going to happen any time soon.”
What will happen, especially in the light of the government’s aim to ban drivers from buying petrol or diesel cars by 2030, Magee believes, is that a range of options will develop to suit the very different needs of urban and rural drivers.
“In Dublin, I think we’ll see a huge rise in car-sharing as people realise they can’t justify the cost involved in buying and running a car when they don’t use it very often,” he says. “There’ll be more hybrids on the roads, there’ll be more electric cars on the roads. I drive into work in an electric car myself.”
That car is the Zoe, which is Europe’s top-selling electric car. Magee has been challenging himself to make the journey in as efficient a manner as possible.
“After 19 years of looking at cars, it takes a lot to excite me, but I really enjoy driving it,” he says. “It’s peaceful, the range anxiety that used to be there isn’t really there any more, and in my experience it actually encourages you to be a better driver – you want to get as much range as you can, so you’re thinking about what you’re doing.”
The government, he feels, has done “a really good job” on making electric cars more affordable through things like grants, but he reckons more could be done in terms of giving buyers certainty.
“The stuff they’ve done is great – and I recognise that there is only so much they can do – but it would be great if they could let people know that things like the grants will be around for five or six years,” he says. “That would give the dealers the confidence to get the cars in, and the public the confidence to buy them.”
For years, Renault in Ireland was inextricably linked with Bill Cullen, who held the exclusive rights to import its vehicles from 1986 to 2007. That year, the company took back control of the distribution end of its Irish business, which is headquartered in the Dundrum Town Centre in Dublin.
It shares its premises with Renault Bank, which is a separate company but which has branches in all 28 dealerships. There aren’t that many car brands here with associated banks – Volkswagen, BMW and Toyota being the others – but Magee says it has been a definite advantage, and the bank has lent €800 million to Irish borrowers since they came here six years ago.
The big story of car finance in that time has, of course, been personal contract plans (PCPs), essentially hire purchase agreements that have been used by the buyers of one in three new cars here in recent years.
In March, the state’s consumer protection watchdog, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, warned that buyers were risking taking on too much debt through PCPs. Magee, having read the 139-page report that the commission produced on the issue, says his view on it is pretty simple.
“The negativity around it isn’t so much about the product itself, because it’s been around for years in other markets. It was about the fact that in some cases, it wasn’t being properly explained to people,” he says.
“If a salesperson is just in a rush to get a contract signed, then of course there’s going to be confusion. PCPs are absolutely not for everyone, but for city drivers who are doing 15,000 or 20,000 kilometres a year, they make all the sense in the world.”
But he adds that he has started to see customers coming in who really can’t afford the car, but still make the application.
“That’s something I wouldn’t have seen since the days of the boom. The good thing is they’re being rejected, but it is worrying,” he says. “Our approval rate is something like 78 per cent. Anything from 70 to 85 per cent is normal, but if you go over 85 per cent, something isn’t right. I want to be able to look my customer in the eye in three years’ time and say: ‘I didn’t screw you’. That’s important to me.”
Magee is overseeing an €800 million investment into his branch network, with the spend seeing the dealerships turned into ‘Renault Stores’ with sleek branding and a more personalised buying experience.
He’s also just signed off on an extension of the brand’s sponsorship of The Late Late Show – it will run for three more years, bringing the total years of its involvement to six.
All this is happening despite the looming threat of Brexit, and the fragility of the new car market. But Magee is confident that the business is fit for purpose, and ready to face those challenges.
“My best prediction is that the new car and van market combined will see sales of between 145,000 and 150,000 units this year, and that next year will be flat,” he says.
“But even if the market fell to 80,000, which would be another collapse – and I don’t expect that to happen – we have done the maths well enough to know that the network we have can still make money. We’ve planned for the worst, but we expect to perform much, much better than that.”

Highlight: From alleged meetings in the Red Cow Inn off the M50 in Dublin to a 380-metre tower in the Kazakh capital of Astana, this is the inside story of how two leading businessmen, once friends, ended up embroiled in a bitter High Court battle 
Body


Jerry Ryan was one of Ireland’s most high-profile architects during the boom. Now he has become embroiled in a complex legal battle with businessman Barry English. It is a dispute that stretches from alleged meetings in the Red Cow Inn off the M50 in Dublin to a 380-metre tower in Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan.
At stake are millions of euro that Ryan claims have been taken from him by English. The claims are made in in affidavits opened in court. English, who runs a major engineering company with revenues of €200 million and a staff of 700, says all the documentation shows that he acted “properly and validly”, and that he “vehemently” disputes every claim made by Ryan. English says he has a “strong defence” against Ryan who went bankrupt in Britain in 2012. He is confident that he will be entirely vindicated, when - and if - the case goes to full trial, as scheduled for later this year.
This is the story of how the two friends fell out and ended up in court.
Jerry Ryan co-founded HKR Architects in 1992, along with Tony Horan and John Keogan. Over the years, he took full control of the practice, as Horan retired and he bought out Keogan. It was an ambitious firm which, at its peak, employed 300 architects working in Dublin, London, Manchester, Belfast and Prague.
HKR was the firm of choice for some of Ireland’s best-known developers of the Celtic Tiger era, and it was working on mega-projects such as the proposed redevelopment of Arnotts in Dublin city centre and a new town centre in Bray.
In 2006, Ryan told me his practice in Ireland was “doing very well at the moment”. But he knew the pace was so hectic that it would have to slow down eventually. “This is exactly the time that we should be thinking about new markets. It isn’t going to last forever.”
As part of this, HKR was following Irish property developers overseas, winning work such as the €1 billion development of a beachfront site in Sarasota in Florida, led by the developer Paddy Kelly. Within two years, everything stopped. Ireland’s banks stopped lending, and most of its developer class teetered on the brink of going bust, threatening firms like HKR, which were reliant on them for fees.
Ryan began downsizing his Dublin office rapidly and searched desperately for new business. In December 2009, he founded HKR Middle East (HKRME) to target the Middle East, where he had already won some business in Libya.
So far, so undisputed. From here on, however, accounts begin to diverge radically.
In his affidavit, Jerry Ryan states his participation in HKRME was, from the start, “under delegated powers of a trust which is for the benefit of my three daughters”. The settler of the Ryan Children’s Trust, he said, was Patrick Stafford, a family friend.
Under the requirements of UAE law, the majority shares in any business must be held by a local sponsor, but Ryan controlled the company, as is common for overseas businesses in the region.
HKRME bid for a large project in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, which it won in October 2010. HKRME was appointed by the Abu Dhabi development company Aldar Properties to design the prestigious Abu Dhabi Plaza there, centred around a 380-metre tower, the highest in Central Asia. HKRME was to be paid a fee of $34 million for its work on this project, but this had risen to $41 million by June 2012, as the project expanded in ambition.
Ryan led a team of 90 people based in Abu Dhabi and Astana working on the project. His health, however, suffered under the pressure and he was diagnosed with small bowel cancer and thereafter with prostate cancer. According to his affidavit, things just kept getting worse. His marriage broke down, and his wife later became ill and passed away in October 2013.
At the same time, Ryan says, he was seeking to ensure he met all his commitments to his creditor banks. “I considered that I needed the assistance of a friend who could assist in running the business, and relieve some of the pressure associated with running the financial administration in the Middle East and London; and who would be aware and respectful of the interest of the Ryan Children’s Trust, and who would, if anything happened to me, ensure that any value created in HKRME would ultimately be protected for the benefit of the Ryan Children’s Trust,” Ryan said in court papers.
He said he also wanted to plan for a scenario where his personal financial position might become more difficult as the crash in Ireland continued, so whoever was appointed would have to be able to act as “caretaker of the company”, according to pleadings.
Ryan said he asked Pat Stafford to come to Abu Dhabi to assist, but Stafford was unable to. He also asked two other business people who were unable to assist. Ultimately, Ryan says, he decided to meet up with Barry English, a businessman who runs a successful engineering firm called Winthorp Engineering. Ryan says he knew English for 20 years and considered him a friend.
Ryan claims he met English in the Red Cow Inn in Dublin in March or April 2011, to discuss his business in the Middle East.
According to Ryan’s affidavit: “I explained the work I was carrying out in the Middle East and the value being created in HKRME, was being done on the behalf of the Ryan’s children’s trust as the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares [sic].”
He says he asked English to assist him with his business because he was under pressure and had health difficulties, and alleges that English agreed to assist him.
This is all denied by English, as detailed more fully below.
Ryan said that in May 2011, he “unexpectedly” received a summary summons from Bank of Ireland, in relation to a minority stake he had in a development. He said he agreed a settlement of this matter in March 2012 which was to involve him paying the bank money in March 2013 from money he hoped to raise by selling a site in Budapest. This money failed to materialise, in what Ryan describes as a “turning point” in his financial affairs. On November 27, 2012, he went bankrupt in Britain.
His woes, however, were far from over.
Ryan says that after he went bankrupt, he advised Grant Thornton, his trustee in bankruptcy, that he was taking proceedings against English, which he claims it supports. He then sets out in court documents on what basis he believes he can take action against English.
Ryan alleges that before English got involved with HKRME, he (English) insisted that Ryan transfer shares in this business to him for “valuable consideration”.
Ryan claims that this was done to demonstrate that English controlled HKRME, and that nobody could interfere in its day-to-day management.
“I was happy to acquiesce as, so far as I was concerned (i) the estate in bankruptcy could have no interest in the shares themselves (and I therefore felt I was not acting to the detriment of my creditors whilst enhancing the simple management of HKRME), and (ii) Mr English had assured me on several occasions that this was in reality an artificial transfer and that he would in reality be holding the shares as trustee for the Ryans Children’s Trust.”
This description is entirely denied by English, as detailed below, and he has furnished the courts with numerous documents supporting his denial.
On May 31, 2011, Ryan said in a letter that he confirmed that he had sold his shares to English. “The letter provided that the defendant [English] would purchase 48 per cent of the shares in HKRME for a total consideration of €100,000, to be adjusted pending the completion of a valuation.”
English later came out to Abu Dhabi, according to Ryan, and on September 21, 2011, he transferred him his shares. The consideration paid, he said, was “€77,000 plus expenses”.
According to Ryan: “The defendant did not pay any of this amount himself; this sum was funded by HKRME.”
Ryan alleges HKRME transferred the funds to a quantity surveying firm on August 23, 2011 and this company in turn transferred the same amount to a company controlled by English, which then paid the same amount of money back to Ryan around October 14 2011.
Ryan said that English visited HKRME about nine times in Abu Dhabi where he signed paperwork necessary to the business. Ryan alleges that around August 2011, English’s “intentions towards the company changed and he saw an opportunity to try and take over the company, in spite of his agreement simply to act as caretaker”.
English contends, as detailed below, that this is entirely untrue. He says he bought his shares properly at fair value based on an independent valuation, and that he was heavily involved in the success of HKRME, earning him the legitimate right to pay himself fair compensation.

By November 2011, according to Ryan, there was $5.5 million in fees in HKRME’s bank account, and more money was rolling in as its project in Astana continued. There was geopolitical uncertainty in the United Arab Emirates, so HKRME decided to move its money out of the country. According to Ryan, English suggested that HKRME’s cash should be invested to get a 5 per cent per annum return.
While English acknowledged the money was transferred out, he said that as the owner of the business he did this for himself and not Ryan or the Ryan family trust. He denies, as a result, any suggestion that he promised to invest money on Ryan or his family trust’s behalf.
According to Ryan, the agreement with English was that “the money transferred from the account of HKRME would be held on trust for HKRME and the Ryan Children’s Trust”.
In addition, he claimed this money would be “available”, if required, to meet the obligations of HKRME to pay its staff and bills and when it finished its work in Astana whatever money was left would be held for the benefit of Ryan’s children. English denies this, and again says all the documents show he became the owner of the company properly - and that all Ryan did was recommend him a company to use to set up offshore companies.
“I first became aware that the defendant had in fact arranged for himself to be named as the sole beneficiary of the sub-trust when advised by David Kennedy and his son David Anthony Kennedy some time later,” Ryan said.
David Kennedy sr, Ryan said, was a Jersey resident who he knew as a client of HKR. He was an honourable man, Ryan said, who advised Irish and British residents on trusts.
English says this is entirely untrue, and that all the documentation proves that he owned the company and was therefore entitled to do what he wished.
On March 15, 2012, a BVI company called Sunvity International was set up. The sub-trust, Ryan said, was La Calais Trust which was settled by David Anthony Kennedy on March 19, 2012.
On April 21, said Ryan, he was in Afghanistan on business, and was in touch with English to say if anything happened to him in that wartorn country his family was to be looked after.
On April 23, said Ryan, $5.5 million was transferred from HKRME to Sunvit’s account in Investec Bank in Guernsey. On July 10, 2012, he said, an agreement was made where HKRME paid $1.4 million to Sunvit as “commission” for a “successful introduction” by English. Ryan claims that “there was in fact no such introduction”.
Further transfers then took place.
In January 2013, Ryan was diagnosed with cancer.
Between April 2012 and March 2013, according to Ryan, “a total of $8,094,873 was transferred from the bank account of HKRME in the UAE to Sunvit’s bank account in Guernsey”.
In June 2014, Ryan said he met English and was “reassured” all of the $8 million was “intact.” Ryan said he told English that Pat Stafford, the trustee of Ryan’s children’s trust, was prepared to pay him for his help - but his offer was declined.
All of these claims are denied by English.
In the autumn of 2014, HKRME had cashflow problems and, according to Ryan, requested money to be repatriated to the UAE to pay its staff. “The defendant refused to return any monies,” Ryan claims.
Ryan said that on February 3, 2015, he met with English.
“The defendant said that he had invested the money which was transferred from HKRME’s account unwisely, and that he had lost half of it. The defendant said he could return $4 million. I was stunned by what I heard and was not prepared to accept this, and a row ensued,” Ryan alleged. There were other interactions between the two men, and Ryan had surgery on his cancer on March 17.
English states categorically that all of the above is entirely untrue, as outlined in more detail below.
Ryan says that in April 2015, he visited English in his office but didn’t get to meet him, as English drove away. “The defendant, opening his car window, said: ‘If you want your money, talk to a lawyer’,” Ryan alleges. He said various intermediaries and his lawyer tried to sort things out unsuccessfully.
This version of events is denied by English.
Ryan says that in March 2016, he went to a property conference in Cannes, where he met David Kennedy sr and told him his story. He says that, subsequently, Kennedy had agreed to provide him with a witness statement in relation to matters, but that this offer was later withdrawn.
In November 2016, Ryan instructed solicitors to represent him in his dispute with English. He said he was seeking not just the money he claimed, but also damages. He said the damages related to HKRME going out of business.
In his defence, Barry English argues that Ryan is “not the actual trustee of the trust”, and that he “does not have the capacity, either pursuant to the rules of the superior courts or the purported delegation to maintain these current proceedings.” He says this is his “preliminary” objection to Ryan’s case before setting out in exhaustive detail all the other grounds of his defence. He states that Ryan is seeking a number of reliefs in relation to funds totalling $8 million which the architect alleges has been “misappropriated”.
He notes that Ryan claims the trust was the beneficial owners of HKRME’s shares and that Ryan was “at all material times” acting as “delegate” of the trust. He then sets out all the allegations Ryan is making against him, including Ryan’s claims that English caused him loss by not discharging the financial obligations of HKRME, and that English was now refusing to distribute funds to the trust.
“The plaintiff’s claims are vehemently disputed by your deponent [English] and I say and believe that I have a strong defence,” English said in an affidavit. He denied that the trust “ever had a beneficial interest” in the business, or that he ever “agreed to assist and work for it”.
He said he purchased the shares of HKRME in a “genuine transaction”, following which he had “full legal and beneficial title to the shares”.
[caption id="attachment_417472" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] HKRME undertook to build a 380-metre tower in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, but the company ran into financial trouble[/caption]
He said that at “no point” did he agree that the monies, which he said were validly and properly transferred to a company beneficially owned by him, “were to be held on trust” for either Ryan or his children’s trust. He said that there was never any deal in the background, as Ryan claims.
He also denied that he was responsible for any damages in relation to Kazakhstan, as claimed. “Your deponent is under no obligation to return any of the transferred monies,” English said. English said he bought his shares in the business “at market rates” with “no commitments”, and that this was supported by documentation.
He said the “documentary evidence” contradicted all of Ryan’s claims, and that he did not - at the Red Cow or elsewhere - ever “agree to work on behalf of or assist the Trust in any way”.
English said that not only did the documentation support him, but also that there was no reference to this alleged interest of the trust in papers produced when Ryan went bankrupt.
English said Ryan’s debtor proposals as part of his bankruptcy proceedings all supported his claims. He said Ryan’s claims were “utterly incredible” and untrue. He said that payments and money transfers were authorised in the “correct manner” and “validly and properly paid”.
He also said it was wrong to blame him for salaries and other bills not being paid.
English said that Ryan had made a “number of aggressive approaches” looking for money to be paid to him or his family, but that these had been “refused, as there is no obligation to return the transferred funds”.
The trust, he said, had “never had any interest” in HKRME, and any allegation that he had agreed to later give money to the trust or Ryan was “vigorously denied”.
English also raised concerns about who on his opponent’s side would foot the legal bill if they lost their action, as he was convinced they would.
English maintains that the grounding affidavit of Ryan contained allegations that were “irrelevant” or “included for the purpose of embarrassing or putting pressure on me”. As a result, he said, he was not going to respond to every allegation prior to full trial.
Ryan, he said, did “not have the authority” to take a case against him.
English said that, in April 2011, Ryan had “raised the possibility of attempting to put assets out of the reach of creditors by placing them in a family trust”.
English said that he advised against this, as it would “antagonise Mr Ryan’s creditors and actually worsen his situation”.
He said that Ryan admitted in an email on April 8, 2011 that no companies had been placed in the family trust, as well as fretting that to do so “might inflame Anglo”.
He said that Ryan had, in his statement of affairs prior to going bankrupt, described the payment of €77,000 to him as the “net porceeds [sic] of sale of UAE business”. He said that this clearly contradicted Ryan’s claim that the business was “from its inception” owned by a trust for his children. English said that such “demonstrably incorrect averments” called into question every claim being made.
English said he did agree in principle to take on management responsibilities for HKRME, and that he did agree to purchase Ryan’s shares in this business.
He said he was in part motivated by “altruism” to get involved in the business, but that once he took control of it and worked hard at making it a success, he also expected to benefit from any profits made.
He said it was clear from the documents that what occurred was a “genuine transaction involving the transfer of full ownership rights to the shares” - and this was again supported by the documentation.
English said he knew that Ryan was under financial pressure and, as a result, he insisted that the transaction was done at “proper value” and could not be reversed. BTG Corporate Finance, he said, prepared this valuation and said emails showed that it was a deal done at “fair value”.
He said he bought his shares in the business properly, and there was no “artificial exercise”, as Ryan alleged.
He said that he was actively involved in HKRME, and that he made “considerable efforts” to help the company deliver on the contract it had won in Kazakhstan. He said it was “utterly fanciful” to suggest he was a mere caretaker of the business, and said that he was “making all decisions as I saw fit”.
“I say that while Mr Ryan was dissatisfied with such a state of affairs, he accepted that as he no longer had an ownership stake there was nothing he could do about it.”
English said that Ryan had recommended the agents used to set up the Guernsey and BVI corporate entities, but that was all. Neither Ryan nor his family were ever intended as the beneficaries of either entity, he said.
He said these were set up for him to be paid for the “substantial services” he provided to HKRME. He said Ryan may well have expected an “eventual return of an equity interest in HKRME”, but he never agreed to this.
English said he worked hard with HKRME, and was entitled to be paid for his work. He said payments to Sunvit were made in return for his services. He said Ryan contradicted himself by claiming on the one hand that transfers of money were “improper”, and on the other by saying that they were valid, but for the benefit of his family trust.
He said other claims were also “nonsensical”, and that he never told Ryan he would transfer funds to his daughters at a later stage. He also rejects Ryan’s recollections of meeting him, and said that he “most certainly did not offer to return $4 million or any sum to Mr Ryan”.
He said he never told Ryan that monies had been “badly invested”, leading them to be depleted or lost.
He said that in 2013, he did meet Ryan in a hotel in London, where the architect made a suggestion to him. This was that English could keep €1 million and give €1 million to Ryan, €1 million to his partner and €1 million to his children.
English said he took this proposal as “another example” of Ryan refusing to accept he had sold his shares, and that he decided to ignore this proposal, rather than facing “another fruitless argument”.
English said he was a successful businessman with assets worth more than €25 million, and that monies transferred out of HKRME were still in the Guernsey trust.
He said that what Ryan was trying to do was to inconvenience and embarrass him while failing to put up any evidence.
English said he was certain he would win the case.
Both Ryan and English declined requests for additional comment, citing the fact this was an ongoing legal action. Only a full trial will reveal exactly what happened in this most curious affair.

A moment of Irish history ends a long, painful struggle

Highlight: Yesterday’s victory for the Yes side will serve as catharsis for a generation of Irish women who had endured painful experiences 
Body


As tallywoman Vanessa O’Sullivan watched the ballot boxes being opened at the RDS in Dublin 4 early yesterday morning, she froze.
She had not logged on to social media since she had turned off her phone the day before. She had no idea what to expect. She saw Yes tick after Yes tick as the first ballots were counted. She felt no sense of celebration, just relief. All she could say was: “There will be no more of my story.”
O’Sullivan’s story involved standing in a bathroom in a hostel in London, aged 24, bleeding heavily, and thinking: “I’m not sure I am going to make it home alive.” She had been raped and travelled for an abortion. She gave up her job and left Dublin because she walked around her home city feeling in her own words “exiled” by the stigma the Constitution of her own country had placed on her.
“We always looked at Britain as this imperialist dark horse that kept us oppressed for 800 years. But they were the ones that gave me compassion, they were the ones that cared for me. Not this country. Now I feel my country understands me. They might not all agree with me, but they understand me.”
O’Sullivan embodies the story of how Ireland evolved from a country with among the most stringent abortion laws in the world to one that embraced change in a proportion far greater than any of its people had ever imagined.
In a strange sense, O’Sullivan feels “lucky” because her abortion happened just a few weeks before the death of Savita Halappanavar. When the vigils were held across the country for the young Indian dentist who died in hospital in Galway, “I felt they were there for me”, O’Sullivan said.
This prompted her to find others who had had similar experiences. They formed a support network where women would sit in a room and share their experiences. Eventually, these women decided to have their voices heard. They wrote to the Citizens’ Assembly to share their stories.
Then one day, Katherine Zappone read out her submission on the floor of the Dáil, never having put a face to the story. Yesterday afternoon, after Zappone arrived at the RDS, O’Sullivan approached and said: “Katherine, I was the woman whose story you read out in the Dáil, the rape case, that was me,” she told her. They hugged and remained in each other’s embrace for a long time and cried.

“All of these women who came forward and told their stories, they changed the hearts and minds certainly of politicians, but also our citizens to bring us to this day,” Zappone said.
It was an emotional day at the RDS as the significance of the vote sank in to those, mostly Yes campaigners, who had gathered. There was little jubilation, just the relief of a load being lifted.
Labour senator Ivana Bacik said it was the case of Savita that had been the catalyst for change on the issue on which she had been campaigning since the 1990s. It was, she said, “a very small movement in Ireland” until then. “That changed attitudes. That and the brave couples and women who told their stories. That is what changed public opinion so significantly and decisively.”
A young Indian woman, at the RDS with her sister-in-law, Fianna Fáil senator Catherine Ardagh, said she was proud to have canvassed, as an immigrant, for change in Ireland. “Savita did not come here to die,” she said. “I voted for her.”
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald wiped away a tear when she addressed the huge scrum of national and international media: “I was out yesterday and met a woman with her kids in Coolock, and she said: ‘Today I feel like Ireland is mine again’. All of those voices that had been silenced, and everybody who felt they could not speak out, now feel like they can.”
Evelyn Conden, a woman in her late 60s, arrived on her own at Dublin Castle early in the afternoon to wait for the formal announcement of the result. She held a picture of herself, as a young woman, marching against the insertion of the Eighth Amendment into the Constitution in 1983.
“I remember the phone ringing in the middle of the night and people on the other line calling me a murderer,” she said.
“I remember the morning of the result itself: it was so depressing to be in Ireland, because that amendment was never necessary. Now we can all say it was worth it, it was worth not running away. It was worth staying in the battle even though it wasn’t comfortable at times.”
Young women in Repeal jumpers thanked Conden for “sticking with it” over the years, but she wonders will they ever understand an era where she had her name taken by gardaí for handing out condoms on Grafton Street.
“You would like for them to look at history and understand it, because if you don’t understand history, then mistakes are repeated. We spend so much of our youth fighting battles, so they will have to continue their activism for other causes as well,” she said.
Did she think they really understood the battles that have been fought over the past 35 years?
“I hope they do, but if they don’t, that’s grand,” Conden said. “In fact, I’m glad that they don’t have to.”

Highlight: The campaign was hard-fought and sometimes deeply rancorous. But in the end, the arguments for change - and the enduring memory of Savita Halappanavar’s tragic death - were more persuasive than the status quo 
Body


In the 35 years since the Eighth Amendment was voted into the Constitution, more than 170,000 women travelled abroad for an abortion. Many of them did so in silence and secrecy. But they all had families. They had husbands, boyfriends, sisters, brothers, parents and grandparents.
No one in Ireland was unaffected by the reality of our contradictory Constitution, which said women could not have abortions here but could go elsewhere to get them.
There was pain and suffering for so many, who remained silent for so long. But in recent years they found their voice, and told the stories that have now changed Ireland.
For some, abortion is never right. Others worried that a law change would introduce an ‘abortion culture’ in Ireland. But the outcome of Friday’s referendum acknowledges that abortion is an Irish reality – a reality that is facilitated by making women who wanted terminations travel to British abortion clinics and, in recent years, to illegally import abortion pills by the thousands.
The outcome also means that this Irish reality is over, and will be replaced by what advocates say is a more compassionate future.
In 1977, David Norris put abortion rights in his election manifesto. “I didn’t get anywhere,” he said at the RDS count centre yesterday morning. Yet there he was, witnessing mammoth Yes votes across Dublin.
“This was really the last ditch for Catholic fundamentalism in Ireland. I think that has really been put to an end now. We’ve moved into the 21st century,” Norris said.
“I don’t think it’s a case for mass rejoicing, because abortion is always a sad thing. With fatal foetal abnormalities, in many cases these are people who wanted a child and they have to lose the child, but it’s so much better that that happens at home here where they have the comfort of their family and Irish medical staff.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar declared that it had been a “quiet revolution”. Across all areas of Irish society - young and old, rural and urban - they decided in their droves that the Eighth Amendment was no longer tenable.
Katherine Zappone, without whom there might never have been a referendum, was emotional. “We are now moving forward more and more into a period where the shaming of women has to be left behind,” she said.
The story of how the referendum to remove Article 40.3.3 became a reality began with the death of a 31-year-old Indian-born dentist at University Hospital Galway on October 28, 2012.
Savita Halappanavar died from complications arising from a septic miscarriage at 17 weeks. She asked for a termination, but was told by one consultant that, so long as there was a foetal heartbeat, “our hands are tied”.
It was a tragedy that changed everything. It triggered a national outpouring of grief, outrage and protests from abortion campaigners, and drew worldwide focus on “Catholic Ireland’s abortion ban”.
“Savita was the trigger,” Amnesty Ireland’s executive director Colm O’Gorman said. “People felt compelled to speak out in a way that maybe they hadn’t felt brave enough to do before. It forced us to face the reality of the extreme harm that could be the consequences of the Eighth.”
While anti-abortion campaigners have repeatedly denied that Savita’s death was a result of the Eighth Amendment, the eminent obstetrician who investigated her case said it had been a material contributory factor. Two of the three inquiries into her death recommended further scrutiny of Irish law and Medical Council guidelines.

Compelled to respond, the government did what it could and, within eight months it legislated for abortion in line with the 1992 Supreme Court verdict in the X case, which said that a woman had a right to termination in cases of risk to her life, including suicide. It was as far as Fine Gael and Labour could go, with both parties arguing they had no mandate to hold a referendum.
But demands for change grew, as more and more heartbreaking stories of pregnant women with fatal foetal abnormalities being forced to travel to Britain for abortions began to emerge. Families who had dealt with unspeakable tragedies began to break their silence.
In 2015, a Red C poll commissioned by Amnesty found that a staggering 81 per cent of people wanted to widen access to abortion in Ireland beyond current limits. “There is no doubt that there is a locked-in majority who want change in Ireland’s abortion laws,” Save The 8th communications director John McGuirk said. “Only an idiot would dispute that.”
Several attempts to legislate for fatal foetal abnormalities foundered in the Dáil on Constitutional grounds, while the state was being criticised in international courts and by the United Nations for breaching the human rights of women by forcing them to travel. But the political system appeared ill-equipped to identify and implement the sort of change being demanded by a growing number of people.
Politicians feared the abortion issue more than any other, primarily because of the intense lobbying from both sides of the argument. The then taoiseach, Enda Kenny, claimed he’d received “letters written in blood” during the 2013 debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy bill, but by November 2015 he had committed, if re-elected, to setting up a citizen-led body - the Citizens’ Assembly - to consider options for changing the Constitution and the law. Repealers saw the assembly as a way of kicking the matter into the long-grass.
But Kenny’s eventual successor, Leo Varadkar, had already declared a year earlier that the country’s abortion laws were “too restrictive”. In December 2014 Varadkar told me: “I don’t think in 20 years’ time the [abortion] laws we have now will be the same.”
Nearly four years ago, the destination was being set.
There were other important milestones along the way, not least when independent TD Katherine Zappone made the Citizens’ Assembly a condition of her joining the Fine Gael-led minority government. Such was her conviction on the issue that she told this newspaper in January 2017 that she would walk out of the government if it did not act on the assembly recommendations.
After detailed consideration of the issue in late 2016 and early 2017, the 100-member body of ordinary citizens voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Eighth Amendment being removed from the Constitution. It then went further by proposing, among other things, that politicians should legislate for terminations without restriction up to 12 weeks. The political reaction was one of shock and surprise at such a liberal proposition. “The public would never go for that,” they muttered in the corridors of Leinster House.
But when a special Oireachtas committee considered the assembly’s findings in late 2017, it reached many of the same conclusions. Some pro-life TDs cried foul, alleging bias and a stitch-up, but others changed their minds, having heard the expert legal and medical evidence.
“That horse has bolted,” Fine Gael TD Hildegarde Naughton said in an interview at the time. “Prior to sitting on this committee, I was unaware of the widespread availability of the abortion pill in Ireland. We can either close our eyes to this, as usual, or actually deal with the dangers of unsupervised access to abortion pills. I choose the latter.”
[caption id="attachment_417521" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Yes and No campaigners took to the streets throughout the campaignGetty[/caption]
Seismic political shifts were happening. In January of this year, Micheál Martin, who moved a failed referendum to tighten abortion laws in 2002, declared his support for the committee’s findings. Going against many grumbling Fianna Fáil TDs, he made an eloquent and detailed argument for change in the Dáil: “I believe we each have a duty to be willing to question our own views, to be open to different perspectives and to respond to new information.”
DCU political scientist Eoin O’Malley said the same-sex marriage referendum had shown politicians that they need not fear social issues anymore. “It gave their position some legitimacy,” he said. “It shows that politics moves in punctuations. Everything stays more or less the same for decades, and then seemingly small events, such as the Savita case, lead to an upswell of anger.”
History will record the transformation in the views of Martin and Varadkar, but few will remember Labour’s long opposition to the Eighth Amendment. “Those converted to an issue always get much more credit than those who are consistent on it,” Labour senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin lamented last week. “The people who change their minds are the ones who make history.”
As the campaign formally got under way, repealing the Eighth Amendment had – politically, at least – gone mainstream.
Faced with this reality, the No campaign knew it would have to convince the general public that the proposals the political establishment had coalesced around were too extreme. “There are people out there who feel restrictive abortion is possible, but what they think they will get is not what they will get: abortion on demand on wide-ranging grounds,” LoveBoth’s Cora Sherlock said.
A stalwart of previous anti-abortion battles, Sherlock’s relationship with the main No campaign, Save The 8th, deteriorated in the closing stages of this campaign as she was replaced in a debate on RTÉ in favour of Maria Steen. When RTÉ opposed this and a stand-off ensued, extremely obvious divisions among the various No campaigns came out into the open.
Sherlock insisted she did not pull out of the debate and told this newspaper there was no split in the anti-repeal campaigns. A senior No campaign source said all three campaigns had agreed on Steen, but that they suspected RTÉ had “got to” Sherlock before she “got the message not to accept the seat”in the debate. Sherlock did not respond to a request for further comment.
Prior to the apparent meltdown in the No campaign late last week, Save The 8th, which was fronted by McGuirk and the anti-abortion veteran Niamh Uí Bhriain, mounted an effective postering campaign in early spring, with emotive messages claiming that one in five babies in England were aborted.
It was a statistic that did not take account of the fact that around a fifth of pregnancies end in miscarriage. It was disputed throughout the campaign. But it was short, sharp and clear, and punched through early on in the debate. “It allowed us to implant in voters’ minds the figures that have remained relevant. The one-in-five poster was coming up on the doors again and again and again,” McGuirk said.
The early postering campaign worried many on the Yes side. Senior politicians, in particular, found the slow pace at which the Together For Yes (TFY) campaign came together and launched itself somewhat unnerving. “I had a concern that they wouldn’t mount a successful civil society campaign,” said one senior political figure.
Early meetings did not go well either. Politicians felt that not enough was being done to settle the messaging and appeal to undecided voters. TFY felt it was time for the politicians to step back and let them do the work. “A lot of the politicians were saying they don’t know what they’re at,” said one senior Fianna Fáil figure. “They were all coming in here saying: ‘It’s fucked!’ ”
Senior TFY figures insisted privately that it had always been their plan to launch towards the end of March. It was a strategy that made sense, according to Colm O’Gorman, who was not directly involved with that campaign. “There’s no point being out 12 weeks before the vote,” he said. “Eight weeks before is fine, and you just have to build it from there.”
An amalgamation of abortion rights’ groups and the National Women’s Council, TFY included veterans of the movement like Ailbhe Smyth. Barrister Deirdre Duffy, formerly of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, was employed as campaign manager, while Amy Rose Harte, a former Labour press adviser, was communications manager. Duffy told The Sunday Business Post earlier this month: “Irish people take this very serious - ‘Give me the info and I can decide this.’ They’re not looking for guidance from other countries and celebrities to influence them.”
That message jarred somewhat with a string of celebrity endorsements that TFY enthusiastically distributed on social media throughout the campaign.
One well-known Yes campaigner, who declined to be named, said TFY didn’t run a good campaign. “I found the constant pushing out of families with fatal foetal abnormalities unsettling,” this campaigner said. But Ó Ríordáin praised the campaign for keeping the disparate Yes voices together: “There has been no split.”
Even its critics acknowledge that TFY ran an exceptional ground campaign, helped largely by a huge number of people volunteering to canvass, many of them for the first time. TFY estimated that between 7,000 and 8,000 were canvassing for the Yes vote across the state. By contrast, Save The 8th put its numbers closer to 1,200 on the doors every night.
The sheer volume of people wanting to be involved brought its own problems, with some complaining early in the campaign of a shortage of posters and leaflets. Except for Fianna Fáil, all the political parties produced their own canvassing material, while a separate cross-party repeal group, Women’s Health In Ireland, produced a 12-page ‘newspaper’ which many politicians used for canvassing.
As well as more people, TFY appeared to have more money, with a number of crowdfunding initiatives, run by Yes Equality’s fundraiser Denise Charleton, delivering campaign funds totalling nearly €1.6 million. All of that cash was spent by the time the campaign concluded.
Save The 8th said it raised less than half of this, around €650,000 - a figure that Yes campaigners are disputing, given the level of postering by the No side across the state, as well as the contentious issue of online advertising.
Figures on both sides of the campaign acknowledged last week that it had been a largely more reasoned and calmer debate than previous abortion referendums, notwithstanding a more aggressive approach from the No side in the closing days, as it zeroed in on what it saw as the extremities of the proposed legislation.
The Yes campaign largely ignored that legislation, preferring instead to focus on the impact of the current abortion laws. “The hard cases” - as the No side took to calling them - became the shorthand for fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest. Personal testimony and the views of doctors and some legal experts became the core messaging of the Yes campaign on the doors, in interviews and in debates.
The former National Maternity Hospital master Dr Peter Boylan was a star of the Yes campaign until late on, with his warnings about doctors being unable to offer life-saving treatment to pregnant women in crisis permeating deeply with women of a child-bearing age, according to John McGuirk. “At one point in the campaign, we thought it was over and done, just on the basis of that issue alone,” he said.
The No campaign was left further demoralised by the decision of Google to stop taking any referendum-related ads two weeks before polling day. While TFY welcomed the move, McGuirk said the decision amounted to a rigging of the referendum against the No side. But it simply spent its money elsewhere and, in any event, the ban didn’t work. The Transparent Referendum Initiative reported last week that unregulated ads appeared on international news websites, video streaming services and elsewhere in the closing days of the campaign.
Facebook’s attempt to ban referendum ads from outside the state failed to prevent anonymous and untraceable posts reaching voters on their social media stream, TRI reported. “Even after the attempts at self-regulation by Google and Facebook, we’re still seeing money spent to target Irish voters online. In many cases the location, identity and intent of advertisers remain unknown,” its co-founder Liz Carolan said.
The effect of digital advertising was much discussed during the campaign, but it was merely one of many ways in which both sides tried to reach voters.
Continuing to lag behind in the polls, the No campaign needed a game-changer. On the penultimate Monday of the campaign, a raucous debate on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live offered one of sorts, as Maria Steen repeatedly attacked an uneasy Boylan. “The Claire Byrne debate was huge for us,” McGuirk said.
Yes campaigners complained about the rowdiness of the encounter, but they were undoubtedly worried by what had unfolded in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers. “What we’ve learned about doctors and experts is that they can’t debate. They can do good one-on-one interviews, but they can’t close the deal,” said one senior political figure.
Boylan was sidelined for the rest of the campaign as politicians hit the front. Minister for Health Simon Harris was particularly ubiquitous in the closing stages, culminating in a impressively strong performance for the Yes side in the final RTÉ debate last Tuesday. His relentless deconstruction of No-voting Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín’s arguments delighted Yes campaigners who hailed him as their new political hero. Harris didn’t sleep at all that night, his phone pinging with congratulatory texts.
Tóibín was the best politician the No side could muster, and gave a credible performance. But a senior campaign figure admitted privately that many of the TDs and senators advocating a No vote were not strong media performers.
Anti-repeal campaigners made a last-ditch appeal to people to vote No, on the basis that there could be an alternative amendment to deal with “hard cases” in the future. But when The Sunday Business Post repeatedly asked Niamh Uí Bhriain to outline a specific alternative constitutional amendment or legislative proposal at a press conference last week, she was unable to do so.
The momentum was shifting to a Yes vote, and politicians began to feel it “in me waters”, as one put it. A No-voting Fianna Fáil TD said it would be Yes “by about 4 per cent”, while a minister who shared similar views believed the gap between No to Yes had been widening since the weekend.
Senior figures in Fianna Fáil, who backed their leader’s stance, moved from uncertainty to confidence that it would be, in the words of one, a “convincing win” for Yes. Labour leader Brendan Howlin did a final canvass in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford, last weekend and came away believing it would pass comfortably.
In the end it was a resounding victory, one that few expected, although some in Together For Yes headquarters had quietly predicted it was likely.
One exit poll said that 75 per cent of people always knew how they were going to vote. “It was won before the campaign started,” O’Gorman said. “But the campaign didn’t lose it.”
Ireland’s attitude to abortion has changed utterly. McGuirk said the exit polls “would suggest that this referendum was lost for us half a decade before it was ever called”.
But it still needed the political system to bring it about, and it was only after the tragedy, the protests and the campaigns that politicians properly responded.
Fine Gael was the party that brought about an Eighth Amendment referendum in 1983, but 35 years later it was the party that ensured it could be taken out of the Constitution.
It started with Enda Kenny and ended with Leo Varadkar, but there were many others who played their part. Standing beside Simon Harris at the RDS last Saturday morning was Kate O’Connell, a TD elected in 2016 in the aftermath of Lucinda Creighton’s fractious departure over abortion three years earlier.
O’Connell is typical of the socially liberal change that has taken place in Fine Gael in recent years. There were tears in her eyes as Harris declared that it was “a hugely significant day for our country”.
“The people of Ireland have clearly thought about this issue at great length and for a significant period of time, and now they have answered that question and they have answered it in a resounding manner,” he said.
This Tuesday, he will ask the cabinet to give him the green light to draft new laws that are only possible because the Eighth Amendment has, after 35 years, been repealed.

Solo: A Star Wars Story: Directed by Ron Howardm, Nationwide, 12A, Rating: ***
The Breadwinner: Directed by Nora Twomey, Nationwide, 12A, Rating: ****
If you thought you knew everything you needed to know about Han Solo by virtue of the fact he had his feet on the table when we first met him in the original Star Wars, Disney have news for you. Their most recent effort to split their multibillion-dollar franchise into multibillion-dollar fragments, Solo is a standalone origin story for the franchise’s most charismatic character; smuggler, spaceship pilot and the epitome of galactic insouciance, which fills in the blanks on everything from how he met his best pal Chewbacca to how he acquired the Millennium Falcon.
I had a bad feeling about this. Solo had a torturous production. Original directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were unceremoniously dumped off the project before shooting was completed, having clashed throughout with producer Katherine Kennedy and writer Lawrence Kasdan – keepers of the Star Wars flame – about the comic tone of their film. Solid, dependable Ron Howard, who got his film break in George Lucas’s American Graffiti 40 years ago, was drafted in to steady the ship.
A couple of years before the events of A New Hope, we meet young Han (Alden Ehrenreich, doing a passable Harrison Ford impression), an orphaned teenage street thief, living on a dingy mining planet with his girlfriend Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke), with whom he shares grand plans to escape. When Han signs up for the Imperial Navy – the bad guys – he goes Awol with mercenary smugglers Tobias (Woody Harrelson) and Val (Thandie Newton), joining them on a thrilling mission to steal priceless fuel from a train. With his share, he plans on buying a ship and traversing the galaxy, but it doesn’t work out that way. Reunited with Qi’ra, who now works for very bad guy Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), Han is joined by Wookie soldier Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and smooth shyster Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) as they encounter the beginnings of the Rebellion.
Fan service doesn’t get more serviceable, but despite engaging performances, a cocksure sense of humour and a few rousing moments, there’s something of a checklist about the whole thing. There’s no ambiguity, no nuance and no part of the story that doesn’t connect with your previous experience of Star Wars.
This pre-programming is satisfying enough in the moment, but quickly forgettable. Rather than examine what it is fans find so fascinating about Han, or expand the universe in which he lives and breathes, Solo dutifully ticks boxes one after another, answering questions nobody was asking.
[caption id="attachment_417105" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] A still from The Breadwinner[/caption]
The Breadwinner is Cartoon Saloon’s third feature film and the latest to earn an Academy Award nomination for the Kilkenny-based studio, a three-in-a-row record as impressive as their films are sumptuously inventive and beautifully made. Directed by co-founder Nora Twomey, this timely and affecting story of children in war-torn Afghanistan is based on Deborah Ellis’s book inspired by interviews conducted with refugees of the war.
When 11-year-old Parvana’s (voiced by Saara Chaudry) disabled father is imprisoned by the Taliban, she and her family find daily life a challenge. Without a man in the house, they cannot leave it. Women cannot walk the streets unaccompanied, which means no food, no work and worse, no news of their father’s whereabouts.
If the family are to survive, drastic action must be taken. So Parvana cuts her hair and wears boy’s clothes and heads out into the streets of a city at war. The sole breadwinner to her mother, older sister and baby brother, she might have the freedom of Kabul’s back alleys, but she’s in constant danger. Her guide and protection is a story of ancient heroes, told initially by her father and expanded by his daughter, which wraps the film in shining armour.
Set in any other time or place, The Breadwinner is a simple story of a girl who dresses as a boy to provide for her family. You could see it set among pirates or zombies or particularly charming bears on your children’s bookshelves. In the context of the Taliban’s war on the people of Afghanistan, the film becomes an exquisite news report; hand-crafted over years with a journalist’s eye for telling detail, unflinching in its age-appropriate way on the effects of an endless war, and packed with magpie references to Afghan folklore and art.
It addresses the place of women in restrictive, fundamentalist societies and, like The Handmaid’s Tale for young adults, is a warning about the power and threat wielded by fundamentalist men. It’s the first animated film I’ve watched that comes with a study guide (on the website, I’d recommend it). They don’t need to do that over at Pixar.
On Chesil Beach (nationwide, 15A)
For his first film, veteran theatre director Dominic Cooke tackles Ian McEwan’s distinctly literary novella that traces the ill-fated relationship between Edward (Billy Howle) and Florence (Saoirse Ronan, great as usual), from their failed honeymoon in 1962 to their subsequent lives, spent apart.
Show Dogs (nationwide, PG)
With a few exceptions (Straw, Reservoir, Day Afternoon) films with the word Dog in the title are best avoided. Proof, were it needed, is this buddy cop comedy in which a police Rottweiler and his human handler (Will Arnett) who go undercover at a prestigious dog show to investigate an international smuggling operation.
Deadpool 2 (nationwide, 16)
Ryan Reynolds made a huge score with his foul-mouthed, ultra-violent 2016 superhero comedy, a poke in the eye for Marvel’s hegemony from within the comics giant’s own stable. The inevitable sequel fails to capture the same anarchic spirit in cynically telling all the same jokes again, but less amusingly.
Edie (nationwide, 12A)
The great Sheila Hancock plays the title character, a recently-widowed 83-year-old woman who wakes one morning, packs a bag and embarks on a journey to climb Scotland’s forbidding Mount Suliven, an almost-vertical edifice sticking 2,300 feet out of a bog. Simon Hunter directs.
Filmworker (selected, 15A)
Stanley Kubrick aficionados will already know the story of how Leon Vitali abandoned a highly promising career as an actor to become Kubrick’s right-hand man for 30 years – but Tony Zierra’s arresting documentary offers new insights into why Vitali did it, and what it cost him.

Albright points to the danger of despots in personal recollections

Highlight: The veteran Democrat draws on her personal history along with insights from her own career in a new book, Fascism: A Warning, which considers the prospect of a global turn to ultra-nationalist authoritarianism

POLITICS: Fascism: A Warning, By Madeleine Albright, William Collins, €21
Madeleine Albright is better placed than most to predict the ascent of fascism. The former US secretary of state was not even two years old when Nazi stormtroopers marched into her native Czechoslovakia, dragging the continent closer to conflict.
After fleeing the German occupation, Albright lived as a refugee in London, where her father joined the Czechoslovakian government in exile. The family returned home to a liberated Prague after the war only to see the country be taken under communist rule following a coup. In November 1948, they arrived at Ellis Island by ocean liner, sailing past the Statue of Liberty into New York harbour. Other relatives were not so fortunate: three of her grandparents, along with aunts, uncles and cousins, were murdered as Jews during the Holocaust, she discovered many years later.
The veteran Democrat draws on this personal history along with insights from her own career in a new book, Fascism: A Warning, which considers the prospect of a global turn to ultra-nationalist authoritarianism.
The advance of autocracy can be barely noticed at first, Albright reminds us, citing Mussolini’s observation that power is most wisely obtained like plucking a chicken – one feather at a time. As was the wont of that generation of continental dictators, the Italian fascist gained a firm footing by ruthlessly taking on opponents, not unlike, she argues, the course being pursued by Putin in Russia, Erdoğan in Turkey and Maduro in Venezuela. Establishing dominance, though, can depend as much on exploiting social and economic grievances, and blindly promising future renewal. Sound familiar?
Albright sketches out the conditions on which tyranny feeds in chapters on leaders past and present before turning to the current state of affairs in America. Trump is described as “the first anti-democratic president in modern US history”, an alarmist who may go down as “the agent of a political fracturing from which it will take decades to recover”.
While she stops short of branding the president a fascist in the making, Albright writes that “if transplanted to a country with fewer democratic safeguards, he would audition for dictator, because that is where his instincts lead”. Still, as she briefly acknowledges, the US has its own pretty dismal record on human rights, having propped up multiple dictators in Latin America and the Middle East.
Readers with even a passing knowledge of modern history will be well acquainted with much of this book’s contents, but the details nonetheless bear repeating. Worldwide, Albright points out, public institutions are facing an increasing lack of confidence from citizens, their trust eroded, in part, by falsehoods spread online. Some 70 countries have seen a fall in democratic health, according to the Economist’s 2017 index, based on criteria including respect for due process, religious liberty and civil society. Among those rated as a “flawed democracy” was the US, where faith in government declined from over 70 per cent in the early 1960s to under 20 per cent in 2016. “Fascism rarely makes a dramatic entrance,” the author stresses. “Typically, it begins with a seemingly minor character – Mussolini in a crowded cellar, Hitler on a street corner – who steps forward only as dramatic events unfold.”
With the gap between capital and labour only widening, that age-old call to defend and uplift a seemingly besieged citizenry remains as potent today. Albright acknowledges the need to address inequalities caused by automation and extreme capitalism, but she refrains from placing any responsibility for the rise of Trump on her own party’s neoliberal policies. The question of how to inspire confidence in those working-class voters who turned to the Republicans is largely unaddressed here.
This book’s reminder of the fragility of democracy is timely, though its historical analogies can fall short. While he might draw from the fascist playbook – and even employ that old Mussolini pledge to “drain the swamp” – the US president has so far been bound by constitutional restraints. “We are not there yet,” Albright concedes of present conditions, “but these feel like signposts on the road back to an era where fascism found nourishment and individual tragedies were multiplied millions-fold.”
All it might take, she cautions, is another economic crisis, corruption scandal, assassination, terror attack or war. Paying heed to the past, as this former refugee calls on us to do, at least allows the early warning signs to be spotted. Fascism: A Warning offers little by way of solutions, but it captures the spirit of these times with an authority few can match.

Highlight: Consensus even among No-voting TDs and senators that ‘guillotine’ technique will not be needed 
Body


The government and opposition parties are both hopeful of being able to avoid having to use the ‘guillotine’ to pass the new abortion law after the decisive referendum result.
The bill to allow abortion without restriction up to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy will be open to amendments while it passes through five stages in both the Dáil and Seanad.
Both Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin are not keen on using the guillotine – the technique of halting all debate and bringing the matter to a vote – if opponents like Independent TD Mattie McGrath or Independent Senator Rónán Mullen try to delay it with constant amendments and long speeches.
However, there is provision in the Programme for Government for the guillotine to be used if the Attorney General makes a request “asserting the urgency of a bill”.
Retired Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness said there was now momentum to pass the bill.
“The very fact that it’s such a large majority makes it hard for the opposition to object to the main outlines of the heads of the bill,” she said.
There were enormous majorities for Yes in constituencies throughout the country with a 76 per cent Yes vote in Dublin Rathdown and Dublin Fingal. But there were also strong Yes majorities in predominantly rural constituencies such as Mayo (67 per cent), Cork North West (65 per cent Yes) and Tipperary (63 per cent). While Roscommon was the only constituency to reject the same-sex marriage referendum, there was a 65 per cent Yes vote in this referendum in the Roscommon-Galway constituency. The only constituency to vote against repealing the Eighth Amendment was Donegal.
Fianna Fáil TD Billy Kelleher said there was an obligation on TDs to implement the mandate given by the people.
“That’s a matter for the individual but, from my perspective, I would urge everybody to ensure they can move swiftly to bring forward the legislation and make sure it’s enacted as soon as possible,” he said.
Minister for Children Katherine Zappone said tha,t having secured a Yes vote, her attention would switch to securing more funding to tackle domestic violence in Ireland.
“One of the most outstanding remaining issues, for women especially, has to do with us moving beyond the culture where we have as much gender and domestic-based violence as we do today,” she said.
The heavy defeat for the No side meant that many of the TDs who had opposed the referendum publicly committed to supporting the abortion legislation that will now be brought forward.
Fine Gael minister Ciarán Cannon, who campaigned for a No vote, said he would “fully support” the legislation despite his personal views.
“It’ll be difficult for some when you are presented with that overwhelming Yes, but that’s how democracy works. To disrespect that would be a retrograde step,” he said.
Brendan Howlin
“I voted against the Eighth Amendment in 1983. I never believed I would see such a resounding Yes in my lifetime.”
Vicky Phelan
“On this historic night, I will sign off a very proud Irish woman and leave you with this #IrelandIsAChangin”
Catherine Noone
“We had cross-party consensus on the Eighth Committee. Democracy brings us this significant result. Most of all credit to the people of Ireland.”
David Norris
“I think it shows people in Ireland are very clued-in politically. They really thought about this and they didn’t respond to the posters.”
Leo Varadkar
“A hundred years since women gained the vote, we as a nation have spoken and spoken loud and clear. We trust women. We respect their decisions. Everyone deserves a second chance and this is Ireland’s second chance to treat everyone equally and respectfully from now on”
Joan Collins
“It was a silent Yes vote. We were getting three to one on the doorsteps, but we didn’t know what lay behind the doors that weren’t opening.”
Micheál Martin
“It was a positive and respectful campaign that gave our nation the space and opportunity to think, talk about and ultimately make this momentous decision.”

An old challenge for a new generation

Highlight: Nearly 70 years after Ireland opened its economy to the world, countries like the UAE are following suit 
Body


‘All politics is local,” says everybody. “All economics is local,” says nobody.
The truth is that the shape of the economy you inhabit in your daily life is influenced as much by the price of gold in Tashkent as the price of grain in Termonfeckin. Apple’s iPhone sales alone change the measurement of the value of output of the Irish economy. Fully one quarter of 2017’s economic growth was attributed to this one product from this one, admittedly very large, company. The message that sends is frankly disquieting.
The fun doesn’t stop there. Last week, Google bought up the entire Boland’s Quay site in Dublin valued at €170 million. Entire apartment blocks can be rented for the exclusive use of one company. Almost 200,000 square feet of commercial property is to be built across the road from the offices of Google and Facebook. And it’s not just Apple, Google or Facebook.
Ireland is home to global giants across many sectors now. The multinational ‘problem’, if it is a problem, is experienced as acutely in Ireland as anywhere on Earth. It’s worth talking about, as the European Commission often does when it discusses the Irish case.
From their last report: “The high level of royalty and dividend payments as a percentage of GDP suggests that Ireland’s tax rules are used by companies that engage in aggressive tax planning.”
Economies are deeply interconnected in 2018. The global fortunes of these global companies when they sell ads in Riyadh affects the everyday experience of the average Irish person in Ringsend. And it’s not just the distorted national accounts. When skilled labour, land or products are made more scarce, the average Irish person sees wages, rents and other prices increase.
Because labour should find its highest reward, Ireland imports high-skilled workers, as it should, and this affects productivity which, vitally, drives the economy forward over the medium term.
Productivity measures the efficiency with which an economy transforms inputs into outputs. In the presence of large multinationals, productivity growth effectively sheers in two, between multinational companies and domestic ones. Productivity hoarding becomes a serious issue. With productivity hoarding comes the policy problem for our government of how to diffuse this productivity throughout the rest of the economy.
Last week, the CSO released an important report looking at productivity between 2000 and 2016. Irish workers saw an improvement in productivity over the period, but almost all of that improvement went to foreign-owned companies.
For example, by one measure labour productivity growth among foreign-owned firms averaged 10.9 per cent over the period to 2016. Among Irish-owned firms, up until 2016 productivity growth was 2.5 per cent.
The chart shows where the growth came from over the 16-year period: by sector in the first bar, by ownership type in the second bar, and by input type in the third bar. It’s clear foreign ownership has been a key determinant of Ireland’s growth over this period, and will remain one into the future.
Sometimes, as well as large increases in foreign ownership by sector, clusters of companies are too tightly enmeshed. The development of knowledge clusters, where economic activity is spatially organised to increase concentration and thereby competitiveness, has been a part of Irish government policy since the Culliton Report in 1992.
As NUI Maynooth’s Chris van Egeraat and UCC’s Eleanor Doyle argue in a recent paper on the subject, “geographical concentrations of interconnected companies, specialised suppliers, service providers, firms in related industries and associated institutions in particular fields compete but also cooperate”.
Using industry-level data, UCC’s Doyle, Sean O’Connor and Stephen Brosnan found clusters were in evidence across 14 separate regions in Ireland. Their importance has waxed and waned over time as governments came and went.
Clusters are an important policy tool in increasing knowledge flow amongst industries, and to foster ‘smart specialisation’. Clusters also change the property markets around them, and the higher education sectors around them.
It is important to understand the influence of sectoral makeup on the Irish economy, including its unusual openness to trade. In 2000, Irish exports were 85 per cent of GDP. Exports are 122 per cent of GDP in 2018, though it has to be said immediately and repeatedly, one cannot really trust GDP as a measure of the economy. Foreign ownership of companies is not value-neutral, nor is it without political implications in Ireland, or anywhere else.
It’s also true that nothing is ever really new, nor is anything ever learned for long. Move your focus now from Ireland to the United Arab Emirates.
The government of the UAE last week signalled a policy change in its ownership structure, as well as opening up visas for skilled foreign workers. Foreign nationals will from now on be able to own businesses in the UAE on their own.
Before this change, to set up and run a business in the UAE required an Emirati national as a partner with at least a 51 per cent stake, which effectively limited the growth of non-indigenous businesses in the country.
Visas were also short-term, but they may now run for ten years or beyond, equivalent to a US green card. The UAE wants to move beyond the production of fossil fuels. It wants to transform itself into a service-based economy over time.
For this to happen it needs ideas and knowledge from the rest of the world. Property rights, ownership structures and investment rule changes are the first step towards this openness. Remember: nothing is ever really new. Ireland started taking these steps in the 1950s. The effects were transformative.
In 2006, Giorgio Navaretti, Tony Venables and Trinity’s Frank Barry wrote an excellent book on the presence of multinationals in a local economy. They found multinationals have distorting effects on industry grouping, location, and network effects, and on sectoral composition.
These distortions can be positive, of course. It would be very hard to argue multinationals have been a bad thing for Ireland up to now. But some distortions they cause can, of course, be negative.
Nearly 70 years after Ireland started its push towards openness, to a reliance on globalisation, the global economy faces quite a few new issues.
Here’s a partial list: the large imbalances in trade, investment, and ‘hot’ money flows between the global North and the global South; the emergence of a global middle-class in previously poor but populous countries like Indonesia and China; the problem of what to do with the savings this new global middle-class accumulates; the lack of rules governing bilateral investments by one country into another, where China can invest in east African countries’ infrastructures differently, and with fewer knowledge spillovers, to west African countries; the large, and growing, concentration in market power by multinational companies.
As their market power means companies can charge higher prices for their goods and services, this increases their mark-ups. The companies can deploy these surplus profits across the globe, and at will. Let’s call the effects of the deployment of these profits ‘googlification’.
The reach of googlification is truly global. Governments bend to its will. Policies are altered to suit its interests. When land or labour is scarce, googlification bids up their prices, because these large firms can afford to.
But can we?

An uncomfortable look at how Celtic culture was co-opted

Body


HISTORY: The Quest for the Irish Celt: The Harvard Archaeological Mission to Ireland, 1932–1936, By Mairéad Carew, Irish Academic Press, €24.95
The word “Celtic” has attracted so many romantic, mythical connotations over the past century, powering a mini-industry of singing tenors, homespun philosophers and spiral-obsessed artists, that is hard to remember how, in 19th-century Britain, it was often a term of abuse, with magazines such as Punch presenting the Irish as the “white negro”.
Irish immigrants to the US faced similar prejudice, but were finding their feet in the 1930s just when the increasingly powerful eugenicists lobby there was successfully campaigning for restrictive new immigration laws to be passed to keep out races whom it regarded as “defective”.
It’s hard to believe that a crackpot pseudoscience like eugenics (which sought to improve the genetic quality of humans by controlling non-interracial breeding) gained so much academic credence in the 1930s – although some beliefs emanating from the present day White House shows that – like taxes and death – the glorification of prejudice will always be with us.
But when Harvard University sent an archaeological mission to Ireland in the 1930s to determine Ireland’s racial and cultural heritage, it was socially and politically important to rich Irish Americans (who were among its financial backers). They hoped that its findings would prove that the Irish were a white Celtic nation of great antiquity and therefore a “eugenically fit” race to be allowed into the US.
The Harvard search to unearth traces of a radically uncontaminated Celtic lineage was equally important to the Free State government, who gave it every assistance. Ever since Douglas Hyde’s 1882 speech about “the necessity for de-Anglicising Ireland” – which claimed that our resistance to becoming “citizens of the Empire” was due to our Celtic past – the notion of a Celtic conquest of Ireland, resulting in our ancestors possessing unadulterated Celtic blood – became one of the founding myths of the state.
Irish archaeology existed long before this mission, which was under the supervision of Earnest A Hooton – then a famed Harvard anthropologist, but who would today be sacked from any academic post as a dangerous racist bigot. But the National Museum of Ireland’s official policy was to prioritise Celtic and Christian artefacts at the expense of any evidence that went against the prevailing consensus. This policy suited the mind-set of Adolf Mahr, the museum’s director – who, as a proudly open card-carrying Nazi party member, felt that unearthing an untainted Celtic lineage could be useful in the widespread political utilisation of archaeology by Nazis to unearth the cradle of the Aryan super-race.
Because archaeology is a scientific study, one would expect that a major archaeological excavation would be done in an open spirit of attempting to unearth new theories about the past. But part of the sometimes slightly horrific fascination of Mairéad Carew’s extensive study of how this Harvard mission was conducted and facilitated – and its findings presented to the public – is her examination of how those findings were likely to be essentially predetermined. These digs were not so much about unearthing the full picture of Ireland’s prehistorical past as highlighting any evidence that fitted into the cultural and racial theories of Hooton and Mahr and politicians who wanted to present the Irish as having “non-defective”, eugenically sound genes.
As listeners to Sunday Miscellany can testify, Mairéad Carew – in addition to being an archaeologist – is an accomplished poet and fiction writer. You wish on occasion that she had used these additional talents to allow her new book more easily escape from its origins as a ground-breaking but quotation-heavy PhD thesis and be slightly more accessible to the general reader.
But it is no small task to identify and contextualise the motives of her extraordinary cast of scientists and politicians and view them through the prism of archaeological practices and racial theories prevalent in the 1930s. Her study of this five-year mission shows the impossibility of untangling archaeology from political interference at that time.
As such, Carew’s book is firstly an incisive account of one of the most protracted and important archaeological excavations in Irish history, which, despite some absurd theories underpinning it, yielded thousands of important artefacts from Mesolithic sites, crannógs and megalithic tombs. But, secondly and equally importantly, it’s an engrossing account not of Ireland’s Celtic past, but of the racial and nationalistic politics of 1930s Ireland and the US.

Another Chelsea victory

Highlight: From South African townships to a Chinese city of 1,000 lakes, designers at this year’s RHS Chelsea Flower Show drew inspiration from eclectic sources 
Body


‘Simply the finest summer party on the planet – and then, of course, there are the flowers. Ah, the flowers . . .” This is how one aficionado summed up the annual RHS Chelsea Flower Show.
For many, the joy of gardening is the thrill of watching that tiny seed they planted reach for the skies. For others it’s an investment in a £10 billion industry, employing more than 300,000 people. Every year, the Royal Horticultural Society scours the world, bringing the best to suit every taste and every pocket.
This year, the Show Garden that captured my heart was the South African Winery Garden by first-time designer Jonathan Snow. It had traditional architecture – with a twist: a 1701 thatched roofed Cape Dutch homestead that provided the backdrop to a swathe of glorious planting.
From the terracotta-tiled terrace where Paul’s Himalayan musk roses rambled over the pergola, steps led to a romantic cottage garden planted with roses, foxgloves and frothy fronds of fennel. A gate led on into the vineyard and beyond that lay a wild fynbos landscape planted with agapanthus, kniphofia, gladioli and the star of South African florals, the King Protea. The odd plants that looked as if they’d been torched were the real deal, the result of endemic bush fires.
In the early 18th century, Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus described the wine country of Stellenbosch as “paradise on earth”. Snow’s garden was awarded a Silver Gilt medal. Linnaeus would have given it Gold.
Another Silver Gilt winner, the VTB Capital Garden – Spirit of Cornwall, was a stylish collaboration between garden designers, architects, musicians, a composer and a sculptor, with Stuart Charles Towner in the driving seat. His inspiration was Cornwall’s unique microclimates which result in so many gardens where sub-tropical and temperate plants coexist.
Towner used Gunnera, Dicksonia and Corydline australis, the popular Cornish coastal town tree, to create a sophisticated setting for al fresco dining. An elegant pavilion provided a space for musical performances, and a nice reminder of the county’s coastal delights were the sea urchin-shaped pouffes.
A dominant theme this year was eco technology. The Silver Gilt-winning LG Eco City Garden had a planting scheme designed to combat air pollution and a transparent solar panel covered the roof of the pavilion. In Kate Gould’s Gold-winning New West End Garden, as you stepped on the black and white chequered floor your weight set in motion electromagnetic induction which generated off-grid electricity. The harvested energy powered the water feature, lighting and pumped fresh air through the pergola. A communal garden to provide a green oasis in the heart of the city, this was one of a new category, Space to Grow, gardens that offered inspiration and solutions for a small urban plot.
[caption id="attachment_417295" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Welcome to Yorkshire by Mark Gregory[/caption]
Gould’s advice for making the most of a small space: “Rotate the design by 45 degrees and the space will seem larger and more interesting. You can then have planting pockets in the corners for things that hide unsightly walls or fences.”
On the largest site in the show ground, the Wuhan Water Garden celebrated the water systems of Wuhan, China’s “city of 1,000 lakes” which for centuries have successfully contained the floodwaters of the Yangtze through a complex system of canals, rills and tidal lakes - something Europe would be wise to look into. It was awarded a Bronze medal, but to my mind, with its 75 different Chinese species, it offered an incredible amount of inspiration for the common or garden grower as to what to grow in different terrains.
The city-dweller’s idea of country living as Arcadia appeared in the shape of Mark Gregory’s Welcome to Yorkshire which won the Best Construction Award. A stone bothy (home to a cheesemaker) sat snug on the edge of a stream that gurgled its way down through the dale. A sweetly scented lilac tree, a neat vegetable garden and the kind of plants most gardeners pull up – nettles and creeping buttercups – completed the picture postcard. I liked the neat touch of authenticity – the old iron gate actually creaked.
I have a blind spot when the impact of a garden is dependent on an over-sized, man-made object. It calls to mind Stanley Kubrick’s Space Odyssey: apes baffled by the monolith that’s arrived, out of the blue, prompting the question – why? What turns me on is the Eden blueprint – plants in plural, the natural life force that pushes up through the earth.
At Chelsea this year, the exception that proved the rule was the Wedgwood Garden by Jo Thompson which won Gold. The major feature was a vast structure so ethereal it looked organic.
Reminiscent of the great nets that African fishermen throw over vast expanses of water, it added a wonderful sense of motion to the concept. Thompson’s subdued planting palette was inspired by the 18th-century colour trials carried out by Josiah Wedgwood, the hues of which were often dictated by the metal oxides available for his staining of the clay mixtures.
Overall, in the Show Gardens, the palette was cool rather than hot, and subtle rather than showy. There were masses of lemon-yellow lupins and white foxgloves and every conceivable shade of plum and rust.
[caption id="attachment_417285" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] SBP Paeonia Sonoma Kaleidoscope .jpg[/caption]
In the Great Pavilion, two outstanding Gold-winning exhibits put the spotlight on hard-done-by communities. Birmingham City Council celebrated the Windrush generation with the ship that brought them from the Caribbean 70 years ago, complete with tiny models of the immigrants themselves, flanked by the symbol of their new environment, a red London bus.
The ship’s twin funnels were carpeted in the curry plant and Alternanthera, a South American shrub. In the planting that surrounded the ship the focus was on allergy-friendly plants that do well on the Opal score.
In designing Iconic Landscapes, Leon Kluge sited the flora of South Africa’s Kirstenbosch against a backdrop of a stylised mural of the impoverished townships that lie in the shadow of Table Mountain and Cape Town’s skyscrapers. Kluge took flak for this, with the folks back home not wanting to remind the world of this aspect of South African society. He should be applauded: the less the world knows about them, the longer those sad townships will exist. “The Cape Flats are a place of natural beauty,” he told me. “Langa Township is where the Arum lily comes from.
Visit it in the spring and you’ll find seas of them in an ocean of wildflowers.”
Flying the flag for Ireland, Billy Alexander brought the Silver Gilt-winning Wilde Atlantic Garden, an exhibit that showed a soupÇon of Co Kerry’s best day-out destination, Kells Bay Gardens, where trees and ground ferns and ancient Dicksonia create a fairytale forest. When, I wonder, will it be recreated as a show garden at Chelsea?
Still in the Great Pavilion, two plants that caught my eye would be ideal for the cook/gardener with limited outdoor growing space. Both were shortlisted for Plant of the Year. Peppers Lemon Dream, compact enough for a small container, produces masses of small peppers (sweet-tasting with a hint of spiciness) all summer long.
The second is the aptly named Tomato Rugby. Happy as Larry in a pot, it has rugby ball-shaped fruits of deep red with green stripes, a case of yum-yum for sophisticates.

Highlight: We have the most weather in the world, we’re the masters of makey-uppy tourism initiatives, and we’ve elevated the deli counter sandwich to an art form. Ireland, be proud... 
Body


Ihave recently returned from a week in the south of France. I know that sounds incredibly posh, but we were camping with approximately half a million ants and one ravenous mosquito and it rained 50 per cent of the time, so please save your “well for somes”. We did go to Cannes for the day and saw exactly zero celebrities. The glamour!
Arriving back in Dublin, I did the two things I do every time I return to the homeland. Firstly, I scanned arrivals on the off chance someone had sent a fancy car and a man with my name on a piece of paper to escort me home. This has never happened to me at Dublin Airport, but still I live in hope.
Secondly, I consoled myself about the end of my holiday by listing all the things I was looking forward to about home: My comfy bed, left hand traffic (I can manage driving on the right well enough, but my paw does occasionally claw at the driver’s window looking for the gearstick, and driving the wrong way around a roundabout will never not be horrifying), non-UHT milk. All the usuals. It got me thinking about other things we Irish have to be grateful for. Our greatest hits, if you will . . .
Ireland has the most weather in the world. It’s an indisputable fact. We’re bloody brilliant at having weather. Pissing rain first thing in the morning, street juice cresting the top of your shoe just as you arrive into work. Roasting by lunchtime, lulling you into a false sense of security and cajoling you to sit on the grass to eat your sandwich (the grass is still soaking from that morning’s four-hour downpour). Sideways wind by 6pm, whipping your headphones out of your ears and your will to live from your bones. Ah, Ireland. At least seven seasons in a day.
It’s been 28 years, but even people who weren’t born until 1992 have Put ’Em Under Pressure coursing through their veins. It’s in our genes. The national pride felt during the 1990 World Cup and Ireland’s progression to the quarter finals means that even now, in 2018, with our football team ranked 31st in the world, we get a burst of “we could do this. We could really shake them up” any time our players step onto a pitch. We’re all part of Jackie’s army. We were great once, we can get there again.
No Irish person is a complete stranger, they’re just a friend you haven’t interrogated yet. Sure, you might be certain you’ve never met them before, but you mustn’t rest until you’ve figured out who or what you have in common.
Maybe you shifted their cousin in the Gaeltacht in 99. Perhaps your mothers grew up beside each other in Ennistymon. You probably worked with their sister for four years and were actually in the pub for their 30th birthday party.
It’s a gift we have, and we are deeply devoted to making sure Ireland is as small as possible.
Ah yes, the Wild Atlantic Way. We were dead right to listen to Heaney when he advised us to “take the time to drive out west . . . when the wind and the light are working off each other” (another nod to the weather there). And what about Ireland’s Ancient East, covering most of the bits we can’t shoehorn into the Wild Atlantic Way? Ireland is the master of makey-uppy tourism campaigns. Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Bono’s House. We’ll turn anything into a reason to make Americans pay €4.50 for a scone.
We might be famed for our soda bread or our deep commitment to potatoes in all forms, but where Ireland has really come into its own in the culinary stakes is at the deli counter. We have taken the humble breaded chicken fillet and placed it on a pedestal so lofty that it might as well be our national dish.
Convenience stores spring up like shiny behemoths in towns and villages across the land, with immaculately stocked sandwich-making stations at their cores. There is nothing a sprinkling of stuffing can’t improve; there is no sweeter sound than “will I cut it in half?” It’s time to introduce a deli-counter Michelin Star. The roll-makers of Ireland deserve it.

Aryzta favours asset sales, cost-cutting over cash call

Body


The chief executive of troubled food company Aryzta has said using its existing capital is the best way to avoid breaching its banking covenants.
Investors have questioned whether Aryzta, the Irish-Swiss bakery giant best known in this country for its Cuisine de France brand, would need to raise money to ensure it does not fall foul of an upcoming test of its covenants given the decline in its earnings.
But Kevin Toland, Aryzta’s chief executive, said that while the company would never rule out a capital increase in the case of a systemic shock, “the right thing to do for this management team is to follow all the proper actions that we should take to create value and to create [earnings] from the capital we’ve already got, which is the measures around improving the business, running the business, and conserving cash within the business, disposing of non-core assets in the business, managing carefully on areas such as dividend [and] capital expenditure”.
As part of its banking arrangements, Aryzta must ensure that its earnings do not exceed four times its net debt level.
The company has said it will raise €450 million from selling off some assets and it has already generated €140 million of this from disposals, including money received from the sale of its Irish food supply business La Rousse.
It has also received tens of millions of euro in dividends from its stake in Picard, a French supermarket chain it part-owns and has put on the market.
However, Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst with investment bank Vontobel, said that he struggled to “understand how the company will pass the covenant test”, even if it sells off assets in the short term.
The next test of Aryzta’s banking covenants comes in July, to coincide with its financial year end. Toland said that ensuring it meets the terms of the covenants would not be all down to selling the assets. Aryzta has said it will slash €200 million from its cost base over the next three years.
When asked about the impact on headcount at the company, Toland said it was “a sensitive area that requires very careful handling within and across the business following due process, legal process, in some instances. I would make no comment whatsoever at this point until such time as I can and then I will”.
Shares in Aryzta plunged again last week after the company cut its earnings guidance for the year by 9 to 12 per cent, the latest in a string of warnings on trading as it grapples with higher costs in the US and Europe.
Over the last two years, shares in Aryzta have lost almost two-thirds of their value.
There has also been an overhaul of its executive team, with Toland replacing long-serving chief executive Owen Killian last summer.

Assembly was catalyst for changing hearts and minds

Highlight: Consensus-building in the Citizens’ Assembly enabled Irish people to embark on a journey of reflection that led to Friday’s vote
Body


The referendum on the Eighth Amendment has fundamentally changed the nature of campaigning in Ireland. The abortion poll marks a radical departure in how electioneering will be conducted in this country.
It is civil society, not political parties, that now holds the persuasive power to alter the Irish Constitution.
Momentum for the abortion referendum originated from the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly. This assembly of 99 randomly selected Irish citizens was a unique exercise in deliberative democracy.
Unlike its predecessor, the Constitutional Convention, the assembly was entirely composed of private citizens. Politicians did not participate in the process of decision-making. The assembly followed the model intended by the participatory democracy project We the Citizens, which my academic colleagues and I founded. Our project was the template for the ongoing deliberative democracy experiment conducted by the Irish government since 2012.
There was much surprise early last year when an overwhelming majority of the Citizens’ Assembly (87 per cent) voted in in favour of dropping the Eighth Amendment. When individual members were interviewed afterwards and asked why they had advocated for such a liberal abortion regime, they pointed to the very process of the assembly itself.
This consensus-building technique – through argument and justification – facilitated greater engagement and mutual respect.
It enabled members to reflect on their views after listening to impartial information. The tone of the assembly debates was noticeably non-aggressive and allowed for issues to be discussed freely and openly. Just like juries in court trials, the assembly cut through the legalese and introduced ‘lay’ perspectives into an intensely contentious policy area.
It also helped sections of the public to go on a similar calm journey of reflection. The assembly process was widely reported in the media and the information gathered in this process served to shift mindsets or further entrench beliefs.
In April 2017, the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment was established to consider the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly. In December 2017, nine months after the assembly voted to recommend a referendum on repealing the Eighth Amendment, the Oireachtas committee chaired by Fine Gael senator Catherine Noone came to the same conclusion.
A month after the Oireachtas committee reported, the Taoiseach announced a referendum on abortion.
The assembly was the impetus for Friday’s poll. It set the tone of the debate over the last year. It was the catalyst for changing hearts and minds. On the eve of the polling day, the Tánaiste acknowledged it was the assembly “that forced me to think about my own views on this issue that were somehow settled before those arguments were made”. Simon Coveney’s journey from a pro-life perspective to backing the repeal of the amendment was one shared by many Irish people.
No matter what side of the pro or anti-abortion fence voters resided on, it is impossible to deny the remarkable influence that the assembly has had on Irish public debate. It has set a precedent for citizens, not politicians, being in the driving seat of constitutional change.
Ireland’s deliberative democracy experiment is unique in world democracy in initiating referendums on deeply socially divisive issues such as that on same-sex marriage and the removal of the state’s constitutional ban on abortion.
The assembly changed the nature of Irish referendums. Civil society changed the type of campaigning itself.
The Yes and No campaigns have largely been built outside the traditional party political structures. Elements of the pro-choice and pro-life movements have an organisational ability that would rival any political party. The key figures of both sides of the campaign were predominately civil society actors and not politicians.
The referendum was characterised by alternative forms of electioneering. The campaigns were financed by crowdfunding online instead of church-gate collections and national draws. In an unusual move, the technological monoliths of Twitter, Facebook and Google introduced varying bans on referendum advertising when the extent of online social media ads became overwhelming.
Any cursory look at social media feeds also tells the story of non-politically aligned friends, neighbours and work colleagues canvassing for the first time.
The ghosts of the past were perhaps the most influential aspect of the campaign.
The deliberations of the Citizens’ Assembly coincided with the announcement by the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation that human remains, those of babies, had been found in Tuam. The state apology to Joanne Hayes, the woman at the centre of the Kerry babies tribunal, occurred less than two weeks before Leo Varadkar announced the referendum. New revelations about 15-year-old schoolgirl Ann Lovett who died giving birth beside a grotto in Granard, Co Longford emerged just 20 days out from polling day.
The Kerry babies, Tuam babies, and Ann Lovett served to loudly remind the generation who were not born in the era of the 1980s, when the Eighth Amendment was ratified, of an Ireland dominated by the Catholic Church.
The timing of these revelations undoubtedly had an impact on the referendum, as did the voices of the present: the Vicky Phelans and the Emma Mhic Mhathúnas.
Nobody under the age of 52 had the opportunity to vote on Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution which guarantees an equal right to life to the mother and the unborn.
They had that opportunity on Friday.

Agent Kelly Walsh has brought Units 1 to 3 Snugborough Road in Blanchardstown in Dublin 15 to the market guiding in excess of €2.85 million.
The investment opportunity comprises a parade of three large single-storey commercial units with extensive parking and ancillary yard space.
Each unit has been recently refurbished to provide a modern well-presented mixed commercial centre.
The properties overlook the Snugborough Road, a busy roadway which connects Blanchardstown to Ongar and Clonsilla.
Coolmine industrial estate is located immediately to the south, with notable occupiers including An Post and Power City. Blanchardstown Shopping Centre and retail parks are about a kilometre away. Coolmine train station is located 1.2km to the south with the N3 accessible 2km northeast.
Atlas Tyres occupies Unit 1, a large auto servicing centre extending to just over 836 square metres.
The unit is good condition and benefits from a large modern reception area of over 120 square metres. Atlas has operated in Ireland since 1972 and has 11 service centres nationwide.
Unit 2 is let to the Dublin Meat Company, a wholesale craft butcher which operates five Dublin outlets and two in Drogheda. The property extends to about 125 square metres with an additional 32 square metres at mezzanine level.
Polonez, an eastern European supermarket, is based in Unit 3. The unit has been fitted out to an impressive specification, with air conditioning systems and suspended ceilings, and extends to some 418 square metres. Polonez supplies eastern European food products to supermarkets and operates 28 stores in Ireland.
The three units generate a combined annual income of €241,000 with a weighted average unexpired lease term of approximately 13.65 years remaining.

Brexit has resurrected the united Ireland question

Highlight: The oldest debate in Irish politics is back in vogue - and unification might just offer the right solution for people  on both sides of the border 
Body


It will require the historians of the future to discover the extent of the political earthquake created by Brexit. In the North, in particular, the movement of the political plates shows no sign of stopping, even now, almost two years on from the referendum vote.
The latest manifestation is perhaps the most extraordinary of all. It seems that there is a back-channel conversation ongoing between significant figures in the ranks of moderate unionism in the North and the government in Dublin.
Channel 4 News political editor Gary Gibbon even claims that it has extended to some in the DUP. The conversation, apparently, is about the future of this island post-Brexit and it includes consideration of the prospect of a united Ireland.
On the agenda are questions like: what does a united Ireland now mean? Is there a plan that can be agreed for it? How much does Brexit change all the old political certainties?
To put it more accurately, perhaps the conversation is about how, post-Brexit, the North can not so much join a united Ireland as remain within the European Union.
How many imagined back in June 2016 that the Brexit vote would have the effect of recasting the oldest Irish political question of all, that the Rubik’s Cube of partition might grow a whole new shape? So much for Rome rule. Maybe we should be asking: what about escaping the grey skies of a Brexit for the bright skies of a European Union?
There really should be no surprise given the signals all over the place that the Irish historical default position is under intense pressure.
For a start, Brexit has sidelined devolution in the North as, ironically, the prospect of a hard Brexit has brought back to the centre of the debate the very thing the peace process has so deftly slipped onto the back burner – the partition question.
Furthermore, given the huge economic threat it poses, it has also radicalised a huge constituency far beyond the normally active political classes.
Remarkably, the moment is coinciding with growing evidence of a demographic change that profoundly complicates any future predictions. The bare facts are worth repeating: excluding those describing themselves as “others”, the 2011 Northern Ireland census breakdown was Protestant 48 per cent, Catholic 45 per cent; in 2016 the demographic of those at work was Protestant 40 per cent,Catholic 44 per cent.
Most significantly of all, the percentages for school children currently read Protestant 37 per cent, Catholic 51 per cent. No wonder, then, that the independent demographic consultant Dr Paul Nolan is predicting that in three years’ time there will probably already be a Catholic majority.
In the past one could reasonably conclude that this didn’t mean all Catholics would instantly fill up border polling booths and head south. But Brexit has profoundly changed these calculations too. The new reality dawning this morning across the North, as it becomes make-your-mind-up time in Brussels for Britain, is that the harder the Brexit, the greater the threat from a border poll.
Come to think of it, could there be a more ironic historical aftershock than that of the political constituency that defied an Irish democracy for centuries one day having their weapon of partition flung back in their faces to wreck their latter-day, post-imperial fantasy?
Is it any wonder, either, that only last week Theresa May was warning Jacob Rees-Mogg about the real threat of a border poll being lost? Were May to finally get sunk in one of these Brexit squalls can you imagine just what Rees-Mogg or even Boris Johnson as prime ministers might do to the queues outside the border polling booths? Bring it on please. Could revenge taste sweeter?
Incidentally, the incompetence of May’s administration continues to defy belief. Last Tuesday at a Commons hearing, Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, confessed she had never read the Good Friday Agreement and admitted to not understanding the significance of Irish and British passports in Northern Ireland. Post-Brexit border migration will be her job!
But if you have any doubts about the dimensions of a deepening Brexit storm in the North, last week, Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and Green MLAs all issued a joint declaration asserting their demand for the six counties to remain in both the single market and the customs union.
It’s worth looking at their demographics. These parties have 50 of the 90 seats in the assembly and if you added the UUP’s ten seats – we tend to forget that they were officially anti-Brexit although ever since, they have gone a little headless-chicken – it means the North’s pro-EU constituency is probably close to 66 per cent of the voting population.
All of this must add up somewhere politically. Last week, our newly elected senator, Ian Marshall, a Northern unionist (proposed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and supported by Sinn Féin) confirmed to Channel 4 News the existence of the back-channel conversation between certain unionists and Dublin.
He explained that “some are now thinking the unthinkable; demographics have changed. We have to look to the future”.
Marshall went on: “Some ideas are being floated that were once beyond consideration and wouldn’t have been entertained by anyone, including myself as a unionist.”
Marshall opposed Brexit, but perhaps of far greater significance is that he is a former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, a once rock-solid unionist constituency.
On the same programme, Professor James Doran, from the unionist tradition and a very distinguished Northern medic, underlined the significance of this development. Doran confirmed that the conversation was at a very high level. “Everything is on the table now . . . if someone offered me a good deal, a better deal, I would go for it.”
Given the immensity of the implications of Brexit, is it not time to involve the EU in more than just the negotiation with Britain? Two decades ago, they began financially supporting a unified Germany. Does Irish unification, which would protect both the European citizenship of the North’s population and the peace process in Europe’s oldest political dispute, not deserve equal consideration? And why not a financial input?
The other big question was always the financial implications of unification, and in this calculation Brexit is central. If so many north of the border are showing an exceptional degree of allegiance to the concept of the new European political union – a rare enough occurrence given recent political trends – should Brussels, having first set the negotiation bar, now become a key player in the resolution of a problem that is, after all, profoundly central to their constituency?
The new political reality is that Brexit has transformed the old Irish unity debate into the new united Europe debate. I’m not talking Marshall Plan here, but why not have Brussels actively contribute to a post-Brexit ten-year plan that would constitute a generous offer to the North and instantly solve the border crisis? After all, the EU itself had its frontierless antecedents in the Marshall Plan.

A CIE staff credit union has referred an incident involving its prize draw to the Gardaí and the Central Bank, it confirmed to The Sunday Business Post.
“The credit union took all appropriate steps to deal with this issue swiftly and immediately informed the relevant authorities – the Central Bank and An Garda Siochána,” chief executive Louise Kennedy of the Citybus Employees Credit Union said.
“As this matter is currently under investigation, we are not in a position to make any further comment at present,” she said. “[We] would like to reassure members that their savings were not affected by this matter.”
The credit union has 2,800 members, assets of €16 million and a reserve of close to €2 million.
A Central Bank review of prize draws at credit unions published in March was heavily critical of a number of practices around how they were run, citing poor oversight by boards, poor policies and procedures, poor record keeping and lack of transparency as being among the issues it uncovered. It was also critical of staff participation in such draws.
Almost half of all credit unions run prize draws, often involving a car as a main prize and dispersing millions of euro in prizes each year.
A source with knowledge of the matter said that the Central Bank had directed that a high-six-figure redress sum be made in relation to the matter at the Citybus Employees Credit Union, which was discovered when the credit union carried out a routine review of its popular prize draws.
When contacted, a Central Bank spokesman said that when a redress is necessary arising out of a prize draw it is the responsibility of the board of directors of the credit union and would be overseen by the Central Bank in its role as supervisor of the sector.

Body


Following a two-year hiatus, the iconic Cathal Brugha Street and Marlborough Street buildings have returned to market and are being sold by commercial specialist WK Nowlan Real Estate Advisors, which is guiding in excess of €12 million.
Although first brought to market in March 2016 by the Dublin Institute of Technology and Grangegorman Development Agency, the sale was halted over a procurement challenge taken by a contractor which meant a date for vacant possession to allow for the relocation of DIT students currently attending catering and food science courses at the colleges could not be confirmed.
The challenge was later dismissed and the signing of a Public Private Partnership project agreement at the end of March has now paved the way for the construction of two flagship new buildings at the DIT campus at Grangegorman in Dublin 7.
These two new buildings, the Central Quad and East Quad, will provide some 52,000 square metres of academic space and cater for 10,000 students and 600 staff. The buildings are scheduled to be ready for occupation by the 2020/21 academic year and will provide new facilities for the DIT Colleges of Sciences and Health, Arts and Tourism and for the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
The college intends to enter into a short-term lease with the purchaser(s), at a nominal rent, until the latter part of 2020 when the students and staff will move to the Grangegorman campus.
Meanwhile, WK Nowlan is offering the city centre buildings for sale in two lots.
The first lot is the Cathal Brugha Street property, an original early 1940s Art Deco style building fronting Cathal Brugha Street, Marlborough Street and Thomas Lane. It is connected to Lot 2, a modern, late 1990s building fronting Marlborough Street.
Both properties have independent access, however, they are linked at ground floor level via a six-storey building, of which the remaining upper floors form part of the Gresham Hotel. The total accommodation spans some 10,761 square metres.
The Cathal Brugha Street building is a four-storey over basement structure with an internal floor area of some 7,127 square metres. It is a protected structure and has been maintained to a high standard. It has impressive internal Art Deco features.
Overall, the accommodation includes commercial kitchens, restaurant, classrooms, lecture rooms, academic offices, common rooms, administration offices, a library, stores and toilet accommodation. At basement level there is access to the Kathleen O’Sullivan theatre, which is a 129-seater tiered lecture theatre.
The Marlborough Street building is a modern part seven/part eight-storey over basement structure which spans some 3,624 square meters and which was built in the late 1990s. It comprises a series of laboratories, tiered lecture rooms, store rooms and administrative offices.
Under the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022 the properties are zoned ‘Z5’ – City Centre – to consolidate and facilitate the development of the central area, and to identify, reinforce, and strengthen and protect its civic design, character and dignity.
Public transport is widely available in the area with the Dublin Bus network operating on the doorstep and the extended Luas Green (Cross City) Line, connecting the Green and Red lines, passing outside each property.
Connolly, Tara and Heuston (mainline/commuter) Train Stations, and Busáras (Central) Bus Station are within a short walk and Dublin Airport is 13 km to the north and Dublin Port ferry terminal is less than 6 km to the west.
A 612 space, multi storey car park, operated by Q-Park, is located directly opposite the Marlborough Street building.
The Cathal Brugha Street premises is located in an architectural conservation area due to the special architectural interest and character of buildings, located nearby. These include the GPO, the Gresham Hotel, the Ambassador Cinema, Gate Theatre, St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and Tyrone House (The Department of Education & Skills) which are located nearby.
The area is also a key retail thoroughfare with a choice of large shopping malls within minutes’ walk from the property including those on Henry Street, Jervis Street, the Ilac Shopping Centre, Grafton Street and Stephen’s Green.

Clergy’s silence on Eighth speaks volumes

Byline: Michael Brennan
Highlight: The Catholic hierarchy’s reticence in the referendum debate would have been unthinkable in the 1980s 
Body


During the 1983 referendum to insert the Eighth Amendment into the Constitution, clerics like Bishop Eamonn Casey and Fr Michael Cleary were in full flight.
There is archive footage of Cleary in the audience of RTÉ’s Today Tonight programme, demanding to know if a female panellist supported abortion.
But the Catholic Church’s authority was undermined in the 1990s by the revelation that Casey and Cleary had both secretly fathered children. Then its credibility was devastated by the revelations of clerical sexual abuse and the cover-up by senior members of the hierarchy.
The Church’s effective absence from the national stage during the 2018 referendum campaign on the Eighth Amendment has shown just how much its power has declined since 1983.
During the live studio referendum debate on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne show, there were politicians, medics and lawyers, but not a clergyman in sight.
It turns out that the Catholic Communications Office never even received a request for a bishop or priest to take part in the debate. There were more international media requests for interviews than national requests. In some ways, that sums up how much the Church’s influence has waned.
This did not come as a surprise to Redemptorist priest Fr Tony Flannery, who has been officially banned from saying Mass for the past six years by the Vatican due to his liberal views on issues such as women priests, gay and lesbian people, and contraception. He said bishops and priests had not played a part in the public debate.
“The Church has backed away from active participation. That’s a very interesting decision,” he said.
Flannery said the authority of the Catholic Church had been severely undermined by the clerical abuse scandals. “It’s inevitable that there would be a lack of confidence and a feeling that Church people don’t have great credibility any more. It’s such a different world and society now from 1983,” he said.
Part of the thinking among Catholic bishops was that it was not their role to reach out to the wider electorate – that was for civil society groups such as Love Both and Save the Eighth. There was also one practical consideration which would not be immediately apparent to non-Catholics. Bishops have their ‘confirmation season’ from February to May, when they have to attend the confirmation ceremonies for every child in every church in their diocese.
But it is fair to say that the damage done to the Catholic Church’s credibility was a key factor in the low profile of the hierarchy during the referendum campaign. There was at least one instance when the bishops were asked by RTÉ to contribute – which was the series of rapid-fire interviews done with Yes and No campaigners by the RTÉ Radio News at One programme. But the bishops declined on the grounds that it did not fit the approach they were taking.
One concern for the Church during the campaign was internal research by No campaign groups showing that around 20 per cent of occasional Mass-going Catholics intended to vote Yes in the referendum. There was even a Catholics Together for Yes group. So the bishops’ pastoral letters to Catholics were aimed at shoring up their own base first. Bishops also put out their messages on social media, with staff in their offices sending out their messages on Facebook and Twitter.
But it is difficult for the Catholic Church to engage in the debate without facing hard questions about what Flannery said was “the oppression of women by the Catholic Church for centuries”. Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin did speak about the debt the Church owed to single mothers who had brought up their children.
“For too long, a mentality was common in Ireland in which single mothers were ostracised and humiliated. This narrow moralistic culture was often sadly enhanced by the attitude of the Church,” he said, in his recent address on the referendum.
One area that got very little attention in the referendum debate was the role of fathers – including those who welshed on their responsibilities to their pregnant partner. One who did raise it during his referendum message was Bishop of Killaloe Fintan Monahan.
“Thankfully, the vast majority of fathers are caring and loving towards mother and baby alike. However, there can sometimes be an abdication of paternal responsibilities. On other occasions fathers can be left out of decision-making,” he said.
The Association of Catholic Priests (ACP) took an even more low-key approach than the bishops, based on the first-hand experience of parish priests. Many massgoers were no longer prepared to listen to sermons about how they should vote. Indeed, at a time of growing anti-authoritarianism in society, it was more likely to provoke a backlash or make them not vote at all.
There was an angry reaction among some of the congregation at a First Communion ceremony in Louth when the priest started to talk about the referendum, with some parents walking out. The ACP’s view was that nobody was in any doubt about the Catholic Church’s opposition to abortion, so the most respectful approach was to let people make up their own minds. For this reason, it also urged priests not to bring in campaign speakers into churches.
One major speaker in the Church’s armoury was Pope Francis. But since last year, it has been clear that he would be arriving in August for the World Meeting of Families Event in Dublin. By holding the referendum in advance of that, the government avoided the prospect of Francis restating his long-standing opposition to abortion. But even if he had arrived in the midst of the campaign, there are Church figures who doubt whether it would have had much of an influence.
That is because the Catholic Church’s key power used to be centred on the large group of regular massgoers which it could get a message out to every week. In an increasingly secular society, it no longer has the same captive audience. Church attendances have been dropping for the past three decades, but clerics say that decline has accelerated in the past year or two. Churches that used to be full now only have a scattering of people at Sunday Mass – and many of them are elderly.
Flannery said the Catholic Church was in a sorry state: “It’s in a state of very rapid decline.”
Due to the shortage of parish priests, parishes have been clustered together, with one priest now responsible for two or three each. This means they have to perform Masses, baptisms and funerals across large areas. Given that many priests are now in their 60s and 70s, with others working past retirement into their 80s, Flannery said this extra workload was tantamount to “abuse of the elderly”.
It has been a sobering experience for the Church to realise that abortion is now another area where its teaching is no longer automatically accepted. This is not a new phenomenon. Church members have long been ignoring its prohibition on contraception and divorce, as well as disagreeing with its attitude towards gay and lesbian people.
There is also a huge shift coming in terms of control of the education system. Back in 1951, the head of a delegation from the Knights of St Columbanus to Rome reported that “the Catholic Church in Ireland had almost complete control of education, explaining that this was one of the reasons why the Irish parliament was almost 100 per cent Catholic in thought and action”.
But during the middle of the referendum campaign, Minister for Education Richard Bruton showed just how much had changed in both the school system and the Dáil since 1951. He announced the end of the ‘baptismal barrier’, which allows schools under Catholic patronage to give preference to Catholic children in their admissions policies.
Bruton’s move was designed to get his long-delayed school admissions bill moving before the Dáil broke for the summer recess, rather than to influence the referendum as one of the ministers backing the Yes side. (His brother, former taoiseach John Bruton, was a strong advocate for No.)
But apart from the Catholic Primary School Management Association, there was barely a whimper of protest at the move. That would have been unimaginable during the 1983 referendum on the Eighth Amendment.
It has been bewildering for many elderly priests, who were ordained at a time when the Church was at the height of its power, to see how societal attitudes have changed over the past three decades. “There’s almost a sense that [from] the world they lived in, the anchors have drifted,” said one priest.
There is some hope within the Church that the visit of Pope Francis may help it find a new direction and purpose. But one visit is not going to achieve much in itself. The Eighth Amendment referendum campaign is another warning sign for the hierarchy that all the red lights are flashing. It could once be safely presumed that Irish people would always vote against the introduction of abortion here, in line with the Church’s teaching. But, as one experienced cleric put it to me, “what we are presuming can no longer be presumed”.
Fine Gael Minister of State Catherine Byrne said there was a message for the Catholic Church in the resounding Yes vote. “The Catholic Church has to be more open to women. It’s important that we look at what women are doing in the structures of the Church. For someone who has been involved in the Church all my life, I think this is an eye-opener,” she said.

Coping classes: Building emotional resilience

Length: 1472 words
Byline: Post Reporter
Highlight: Dr Harry Barry’s latest book, Emotional Resilience, addresses the topic of coping successfully with difficult experiences. Here, he explores seven common life situations where many people often struggle 
Body


Life is a rollercoaster ride full of peaks and troughs. We all love the peaks where the world is at our feet. But what do we do when down in the valleys, where the peaks seem a long way off? When the storms of life come roaring in and we are faced with significant challenges? Where our ability to duck and weave and adapt is tested to the full? How we cope will depend heavily on our ‘emotional resilience’.
This relates to our individual capacity to cope emotionally with the slings and arrows of life. In my book Emotional Resilience, I detail 20 important personal, social and life skills which can transform your capacity to adapt and cope with difficult life situations. There are many such occasions, but we are going to explore seven common situations where we often struggle and see how such skills would work in practice.
We all fail on a regular basis, and on occasions spectacularly so. Failure is an innate part of the human condition. In our modern, social media-driven world, success is what so many crave. This is especially so in our adolescent and young adult population. Those who really struggle to cope with failure rate themselves as human beings depending on how successful or not they perceive themselves, and how other perceive them.
This is because we have become obsessed with the world of rating. Once again, technology and social media are playing a major role in driving this obsession. We are all busy rating ourselves and our lives versus the lives of others. Those who are successful are rating themselves as ‘successes’, whereas those who fail are doing the opposite so rating themselves as failures.
This brings us the whole concept of self-esteem – seen by so many as the best way to boost our mental health and resilience. But what is self-esteem? It is a myth. For it suggests that human beings can be rated, one against another. In practice, all of us are unique, special human beings and must learn to accept ourselves as we are and cease allowing others to rate us as human beings. We are, however, responsible for our behaviour and free to rate it, as indeed are others. This is a much more challenging concept as it forces us to explore our behaviour and if necessary change it, while accepting ourselves as the wonderful individuals we all are.
To learn to cope with failure we must learn the skill of unconditional self-acceptance, where we cease rating ourselves as failures if things do not work out. Remember: the only failure in life is not getting back up again.
Catastrophising is another behavioural pattern we can find ourselves regularly falling into. This is where we visualise the worst-case scenario, without any evidence to back this up. To develop emotional resilience, write down such catastrophic cascades, these ‘worst-case scenarios’ on paper and challenge them. This is because, when something is going on in our emotional mind alone, we tend to catastrophise. When you write it down, your rational mind is now able to logically analyse your conclusions and, of course, dismiss them as there is no evidence to back up such claims.
Our forefathers were especially aware of and sensitive to the unfairness of life. This harsh reality has been dumbed down in our modern new world. Life is not, and has never been, fair. Those who believe this to be so frequently end up hurt and bruised by life. They often demand that others and life should absolutely treat them fairly. How often do you feel that life is unfair? Or that others are not treating us the way we feel they should? These are the ‘rocks’ we carry as baggage through life, and we must learn how to drop them if we wish to become emotionally resilient. This we do by forgiving others and life. This does not mean we cannot swiftly challenge another’s behaviour if felt inappropriate.
There is an increasing tendency for all of us to believe that perfection is both achievable and desirable. This has given rise to a host of mental health difficulties such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders and even self-harm.
‘Underlying perfectionism’ is a demand for 100 per cent perfection in relation to all aspects of our lives, including appearances, social media, homes, academic and sporting achievements and so on. If we cannot achieve these impossible demands for absolute perfection, we then rate ourselves as failures.
If you find yourself in this group, you may also notice yourself seeking imperfections – and only imperfections – in yourself and others. To counteract this, you will need to challenge our demand for 100 per cent perfection on paper. You’ll need to develop unconditional self-acceptance and, I suggest, challenge yourself by purposely creating imperfections in our appearances or homes each day . . . and learn how to accept them.
At least 20 per cent of us are also chronic procrastinators. This means that we persistently put things on the long finger. ‘Why should we do something today that we could possibly put off till tomorrow’?
There are two common reasons (apart from simple laziness) that we tend to engage in procrastinating behaviour. One group does so because they tend to become anxious as they cannot initiate the task until they are 100 per cent confident it will be done perfectly. The second group relates to those who become frustrated as to why ‘they’ should have to endure the discomfort of having to complete the task at all. In both scenarios, we tend to delay beginning the task until close to the deadline, where we end up frantically trying to finish it in time.
If you can relate to this pattern, you will have to firstly challenge the demands for perfectionism, or that you should not have to suffer discomfort which underlie your procrastination. You must then learn how to create a personal deadline before your actual deadline. Then break the task and the time available into three parts. Complete each part in the allotted time.
How many of us really struggle in social situations? This is often because you may lack some critical social skills. You may find simple social interactions incredibly challenging, believing that others can see how physically anxious you are, and how awkward and clumsy you appear while engaging in conversation with others. You may dread any social occasion as a result. Or you may struggle with empathy, or how to read non-verbal cues socially. You may dread any public performance.
At the heart of our difficulties lies the misperception of what happens in social situations versus what happens in real life. We all assume that everyone can see the physical symptoms of anxiety in social situations. How accurate is this perception? Or that we should be able to ‘wow’ others with our knowledge when in conversation. Once again, is this true? Or that our first impressions are always accurate. Amazingly, this is often not borne out in real life.
If you can learn to challenge such misperceptions, social situations will cease to cause you such difficulties.
How often have you felt tired but wired after a period of persistent stress? Or found yourself struggling to sleep, with nightmares and teeth grinding resulting? Such periods are often created by allowing an unhealthy work/life balance to creep into our lives.
You need to regularly create your own priority list detailing in what order you put the following – work, children (if relevant), wider family, relationship, self and the rest (including social media and hobbies). Those who would put them in the order just listed are going to struggle, as they are not putting them in the correct hierarchy. Should the list not read: self, relationship, children, wider family, work and the rest?
Interpersonal conflicts are part of life. None of us can escape from this reality. These conflicts may arise between spouses, siblings, parents and children, work colleagues and even within communities. But why do they grow legs? Why can it be so difficult to deal with them?
There are many reasons. Human beings are emotional creatures, so emotions such as hurt, anger, jealousy and others can encourage us to take fixed positions and to delay us trying to sort out the issues involved. We may refuse to look at the conflict from the other party’s point of view or treat it as a ‘personal’ affront, rather than assessing the issues rationally. We may be too slow to seek out a mediator to act as a go-between, and thus allow matters to harden and become more difficult to resolve.
So, deal with potential conflicts earlier. Analyse why both you and the person involved are feeling and behaving the way you are. Then arrange a meeting and, perhaps with the assistance of a mediator, problem-solve the issues involved. Peace will subsequently ensue!

Roadbridge’s Dublin Airport Authority project is the first Irish construction site to win a Gold Award with the Considerate Constructors Scheme, which was launched in Ireland last year.
Conor Gilligan, Roadbridge’s managing director, said: “Roadbridge is delighted to have won the first Gold Award on an Irish-registered project for the North Runway Construction Package 1 at Dublin Airport.
“This award is a testament to the dedicated project and support team at Roadbridge and also to the collaborative working relationship throughout the works between ourselves and the Dublin Airport Authority team.
“We look forward to continuing registering further Irish projects with the Considerate Constructors Scheme, as it is an excellent means of driving improvements across the company. The scheme fits in very well with our core ethos of being a good neighbour.”
The scheme registers around 8,000 construction sites, companies and suppliers in Britain each year, and is a force for good, helping to encourage and support the construction industry to raise its standards in line with the scheme’s Code of Considerate Practice.
Its national site awards are one of the most revered accolades within the construction industry. They recognise scheme-registered sites that have demonstrated the highest levels of consideration in respect of the community, environment and workforce.
Considerate Constructors Scheme chief executive Edward Hardy said: “To receive a gold award is a fantastic achievement for Roadbridge and Dublin Airport Authority. They have clearly embraced the highest standards expected by the scheme, demonstrating exceptional performance in considerate construction and a commitment to improving the image and reputation of our industry.
“Since introducing registration to Ireland in 2017, we have been inundated with requests from contractors, companies, suppliers, clients and professional partners, all keen to register with the scheme. We are thrilled with this commitment by the Irish construction industry, and look forward to welcoming more registrations – and crowning even more exceptional Irish projects at future Scheme awards.”
The DAA’s Maurice Hennessy, who is the executive lead for the North Runway Project, said: “North Runway is the most important project that Ireland will build in a generation, as it will drive growth in tourism, connectivity and jobs for decades to come.”

Length: 489 words
Byline: Post Reporter
Highlight: This week, Stephen Ryan of the newly-opened Lucky Duck bar and restaurant in Dublin city centre (theluckyduck.ie) has two contrasting dishes for you to try 
Body


Shoulder of Kerry Hill lamb with salsa verde
Ingredients, serves five
1 whole lamb shoulder
150ml Newgrange rapeseed oil
Salt for seasoning
A few sprigs of rosemary
3 garlic
Two onions, two carrots and two sticks of celery, roughly chopped into chunks
2 litres chicken stock
For the salsa verde
110g flat leaf parsley
55g basil
55g mint
50g capers
20g Dijon mustard
100ml olive oil
Salt and pepper for seasoning
Method
1. To make the salsa verde, blitz everything except the salt and pepper together, Season, taste and adjust the seasoning to your taste. You can also add a little lemon juice for a bit of sharpness if you like. Set aside until needed.
2. Pre-heat the oven to 160C. Rub the lamb shoulder with the rapeseed oil, salt, rosemary and garlic, then brown it in a roasting tray until it is golden all over.
3. Put the chunks of onion, carrot and celery in the bottom of a deep roasting tray.
4. Place the lamb shoulder on top, pour over the chicken stock, then wrap the dish in tin foil.
5. Cook for three hours, then remove the dish from the oven and allow the meat to rest for an hour, still covered.
6. The meat will then be ready to eat, but if you’d like to reproduce what we do in the restaurant, remove the bone and any excess fat, press the meat between two trays with a weight on top, and leave overnight in the fridge. We then portion the lamb and pan fry on one side until golden, then serve it with the salsa verde, some purple sprouting broccoli, and the salsa verde.
Ingredients, serves four
3 bananas
450ml cream
100g caster sugar
6 free range eggs
1 lime zest
For the dates
20g dried dates
50g Pomegranate molasses
100ml water
100ml orange juice
2 cardamom cloves
Zest of one orange
For the honeycomb
415g caster sugar
150ml glucose syrup
65ml honey
18g bicarbonate of soda
Method
1. To make the custard, purée the bananas, then put them into a pot with the cream and heat gently, stirring all the time. Whisk in the sugar and eggs, whisking constantly until the mixture reaches boiling point.
2. Take off the heat and continue to whisk until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Pour into four glasses or bowls and rest in the fridge for at least six hours, or ideally overnight.
3. To make the honeycomb, line a deep tray with baking paper. Place the sugar, glucose and honey in a large saucepan and stir over a low heat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture has reached 160C – you will need a kitchen thermometer for this step.
4. Remove from the heat, add the bicarbonate of soda, and whisk quickly to dissolve. Pour into the lined tray and leave to cool for an hour, then store in an airtight container.
5. Slice the dates in half or quarter, and place in a bowl with the cardamom and orange zest. Bring the molasses, orange juice and water to the boil, pour over the dates, cover and leave to cool.
6. To assemble the dish, take the bowls of custard out of the fridge, crumble the honeycomb over it and spoon the dates on top.

Highlight: This auction lists a wide variety of value-for-money properties, according to the agent, with sites starting at €5,000 in Conna, Cork
Body


Having sold 25 of 27 properties at auction in April, Cork-based agent DNG Creedon raised in excess of €3.7 million and will now host another offering of a further 31 properties at its next auction on June 6 at the Imperial Hotel, South Mall Cork.
This auction lists a wide variety of value-for-money properties, according to the agent, with sites starting at €5,000 in Conna, Cork. It also includes what DNG Creedon Shane Finn has called a shrewd investment property at 8 Washington Street in Cork city at €325,000, so there is something for everybody.
Number 8 Washington Street West is a landmark building and a good example of a pre-1963 property. At over 123 square metres, split over four floors, the ground floor is given to a commercial space and the three remaining floors split into three one-bedroom apartments. This property has rental potential of €45,000 to €48,000 per annum when fully let. At a guide of €325,000, this gives potential yield of 15 per cent.
In walk-in condition, the building is adjacent to the new event centre on the old Beamish & Crawford site, and the rental potential is strong.
Comprising two back-to-back units, another lot, 75 Main Street and 72 Thomas Davis Manor in Mallow, Co Cork, is guiding €75,000. The 242 square metre commercial property is priced below build cost, with No 75 fronting onto the town’s main street and would make for an ideal takeaway or restaurant, according to Finn. These two units have a rental potential of more than €25,000 per annum, with a possible yield of over 33 per cent.
Directly across the road from this substantial property is 100 Main Street, sold at DNG Creedon’s April auction. With a guide price of €55,000, it made €91,000 on the day. Nos 72 and 75 are superior pieces of real estate, both in size and condition.
These properties are being brought to auction by DNG Creedon on June 6 at the Imperial Hotel, South Mall, Cork. Registrations start at 10am with the auction starting at 11am. The auction will be streamed live on DNG Creedon’s website dngcreedon.ie.

Entrepreneur Experience: O’Donovan brothers will stop at nothing to reach the pinnacle
Sunday Business Post
May 26, 2018

Length: 2235 words

Highlight: The champion Cork rowers are so much more than the good-natured entertainers we watched at the 2016 Olympics – they possess all the key ingredients for success in business and sport 
Body


I have always believed in the parallels that exist between high performance in business and sport. The more high-performing sportsmen and women I speak to, the clearer this belief has become.
However, I have observed one difference: high-performing sportspeople have a far greater insight into the key components of winning than their successful businesses counterparts. This was reaffirmed when I interviewed Ireland’s Olympic rowing silver medallists, Paul and Gary O’Donovan, at the 2018 CorkBIC Entrepreneur Experience held in Ballymaloe House last week.
The Entrepreneur Experience is a 24-hour event which brings 24 of Ireland’s leading entrepreneurs together with 24 of the country’s brightest, up-and-coming business people for 24 hours of intense mentoring and learning. This annual event has helped over 200 emerging entrepreneurs achieve their potential over the past eight years.
My interest in interviewing the O’Donovan brothers at the event was selfish. I wanted to learn from their journey and understand the true parallels between their high-performance approach in sport and what the audience and I were looking to achieve in business. It wasn’t designed to be a serious conversation but, as I posed some early questions, it was clear that we were going to see a very thoughtful and serious side of them.
Their public persona of being entertainers or even messers, having the craic, “pulling like dogs” and “living on steak and spuds” was nowhere to be seen. They knew we wanted insights more than selfies, and insights they delivered. Their insights had clear relevance to business and here’s a glimpse into some of the ones that resonated with me.
Even at the tender age of seven, the great honour of being part of the exclusive group of people to have represented your country at an Olympic Games was not going to be enough for this pair. They wanted medals.
Gary talked fondly about the faith the established rowers have always had in the youngsters coming into Skibbereen Boat Club. He said: “We have belief in the youngsters and if they have an Olympic dream, nobody would ever doubt them.” This environment supported big dreams regardless of your age or starting point.
Fear and a lack of self-belief are big obstacles in business and sport. If you have people around you that believe in you and allow you to dream big, you have a huge advantage. Fear of failure kills most dreams. Whether in business or in sport, ask yourself if your environment supports your own big dreams. Then ask if it supports the big dreams of the people around you.
There were 23 founding member clubs of the association, the oldest being the Pembroke Club in Dublin with a history dating back to 1836. Established in 1970, Skibbereen Rowing Club started well behind the competition – in fact, over 130 years behind them.
Skibbereen is a small rural town 80km southwest of Cork city, with a population of just over 2,000 people. Despite being outside the top 100 towns by size in Ireland, it is the most successful town in the country for producing international rowers.
To date, Skibbereen Rowing Club’s members have 170 National Rowing Championships wins and close to 100 international medals to their name. This is more than any other club in the country. The magic appears to be the supportive culture of the club and the work ethic and self-belief it instils in members from a very young age. It is clearly a high-performance environment.
Entrepreneurs and business leaders need to be conscious of two environments they operate in: the internal one they develop in their organisations, and the external environment where they gain personal inspiration, confidence, ideas and perspective.
Sitting at the top of organisations can be lonely, and by mixing with other people in similar situations (either formally or informally) you can learn a lot. By being around people who are world class in their disciplines you become aware of not only what they do to achieve success but, more importantly, how they think and what makes them tick. In both business and sport, success starts with self-belief and developing a winning mindset.
From a very early age, the brothers were consciously and subconsciously building strong foundations which would provide the base for them rising all the way to the peak of their sport. They were competitive kids, full of energy, always up to mischief and fighting with each other. Rowing provided them with an ideal outlet to channel these energies without hurting each other.
They put in the “hard yards”, learning the technical skills early. Despite being technically very different as rowers, they seems to have developed this difference in style and personality into a strength. These solid foundations were built while having fun and developing lifelong friendships.
They talk fondly of their clubmates, teammates and best mates, Mark O’Donovan and Shane O’Driscoll, who won gold medals in the European and World Championships in 2017.

Speaking to them it is clear they love what they do. Gary mentions the importance of having the first 70 to 80 per cent right. Without that, he says, you are wasting your time focusing on the little things. These are the foundations for success, the important things. For the O’Donovans, the foundations include ambition, openness, honesty, commitment, self-awareness, focus, hunger, sacrifice and team work in addition to the physical and technical aspects of the sport.
The lesson for us in business is to get the basics right before we start to hone in on the details. I have seen a lot of companies over the years get distracted by what they see as the 1 per cent changes that will make them world class while neglecting the basics.
Get the big things right early: right dream, right people, right mindset, right culture, right plan and collective alignment and commitment. Even if these sometimes feel too basic to spend quality time on, ignore them at your peril.
It was a brave move, supported by Rowing Ireland. Dominic was a part-time Skibbereen coach who had trained the brothers since they were in their teens. Paul and Gary speak of him with admiration and deep respect: “He always believed in us and we always believed in him . . . He was learning and we were learning . . . He was willing to put everything in like we were.”
The facilities in their small club in Skibbereen were not in the league of those at the National Rowing Centre, but they had what they needed. They worked with what they had. They knew working hard in the right environment was the cornerstone of their Olympic campaign.
As a basic, they established that all international rowing medallists were doing at least 8,000km a season, the equivalent of rowing around Ireland seven times. Distance was important, but the quality of these kilometres was more important. They focused on the quality.
In 2016, the year they won Olympic silver medals, they had clocked up 8,300km of rowing, many of these on the picturesque river Ilen in Skibbereen.
So many entrepreneurs get caught in the trap of “if only I had more money or resources I could do more”. The O’Donovans, like great entrepreneurs and business leaders, focus on making the most of what they have. They realise there could always be more but that cannot be used as an excuse. No excuses.
They keep it simple, focusing on a plan that can be measured, with no room for subjectivity. No noise, confusion, ambiguity. Either it does, or it doesn’t make the boat go faster. Everything they do is judged against this simple question.
This level of focus results in a “no excuses” approach to their rowing. They operate with what they have and still believe they can win. Could the facilities be better? Yes. Would warm-climate training be better? Yes. Do they have to borrow boats at training camps sometimes? Yes.
But the main question is: Will any of these stop them from winning medals or stand in their way? The answer is no. They focus on the priorities: training hard, having their bodies in peak condition and raising the sponsorship to attend vital international regattas.
When I met Paul and Gary in 2015, before they had qualified for the Olympics, I was taken by the simple, almost monastic lives they lived. At the time they were living with their granny, with what little money they had going into subsistence and training. Despite their winning Olympic medals, resources are still scarce and what funds they have are now used to attend key international competitions.
To this end, they are working closely with David McHugh, founder of high-profile agency Line Up Sports to help them with the commercial aspects of funding their 2020 Olympic campaign.
Businesses can get distracted and sometimes lose focus on the things that truly drive performance. In business, we often struggle to distil success down to its main component parts with the level of honesty and awareness that elite athletes do.
Simplification sounds easy, but it requires a lot of effort to simplify or distil something down successfully. Once you have simplified it, it becomes far easier to communicate it, align people to it, stay focused on it, measure it and benchmark it. Clarity is key.
In 2015, after qualifying for the 2016 Olympics with an 11th at the Rowing World Championships in France, the brothers attended a training camp in Spain. It happened to be in the same location as the German pair who had come sixth in the World Championships, five places higher than the Irish duo.
The German crew had also won the under-23 World Championships twice. The O’Donovans learned more from watching the Germans than from any conversations they had had with them. For three weeks they saw the German crew eat the same as them, sleep the same as them and row daily on the same stretch of water as them.
The significant difference was the Irish team was clocking up more kilometres every day, which gave Paul and Gary the confidence that they were going to make gradual gains on them over time. Simple observations, but psychologically very important.
[caption id="attachment_417374" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Gary and Paul O’Donovan celebrate winning their Olympic silver medal at the Rio Olympics. In Tokyo they will be going for gold Pic: INPHO/Morgan Treacy[/caption]
Having returned from Australia and New Zealand recently with teammates Mark and Shane, they further demystified the approach and strategies of a number of the highly successful southern hemisphere teams.
Having become friendly with both teams’ coaches, the brothers had the opportunity to train with both nations. New Zealand rowing has a world-class reputation similar to New Zealand rugby’s All Blacks. Spending time in New Zealand demystified the Kiwis’ success for the O’Donovans.
Paul said: “We came away realising they are not doing anything we are not doing, and we actually have better water to train on because there is less disturbance by speedboats, wakeboards and jet skis.”
This trip reinforced their view that there is no reason why the brothers can’t beat the best in the world.
Entrepreneurs and business leaders need to travel abroad, knock on doors and talk to people to truly understand what is happening in their sectors globally. It’s hard to become world class if you don’t know what the world looks like.
Jump on aeroplanes, visit new markets and don’t be shy in seeking to meet world leaders in your discipline. If you don’t ask, you don’t get. It’s good to talk.
The layman sees rowing as a sport involving a stretch of water, two men, a boat and two oars with little change in the sport occurring year to year. The O’Donovans see it as a constantly evolving sport with advancements occurring in all aspects of the inputs which need to be assessed and embraced to maximise the speed of the boat.
They are interested in everything that could make the boat go faster: training, nutrition, physiology, psychology, physiotherapy, biomechanics and more. The more questions they ask, the more they learn, the more they can craft their talents and gain greater confidence.
Great leaders are great learners and usually great listeners with a desire to do things differently and better. In most circumstances in business, a leader delivering a great question can have a greater impact than one with a great answer. Listening is an art. A question for all of us: Do you spend more time talking or listening?
Having reached the top of their sport they are now constantly focused on the small gains. They embrace change and seek it out in a world where so many people fear it.
It is clear that Paul and Gary are going for gold in Tokyo in 2020. Having been exposed to the inner workings of their minds and their approaches, I have full faith in their ability to deliver. With recent PBs (personal bests) to their names, they are getting better and better, and I wouldn’t bet against them.
In business and life we all need to embrace change because the world is changing fast. Embrace it, enjoy it and keep getting better and better at whatever it is that is important to you.

Spillane’s
The Maharees, Castlegregory, Co Kerry
066-7139125, spillanesbar.com
Chef: Sammy Khamsa
Were any of you, by any chance, hanging around Castlegregory in 1975? I ask because I’d love to know what the reaction was to the decision by the owners of Spillane’s to start serving homemade burgers.
I know that in my hometown, the appearance of food – hot food at that – in a pub in the 1970s or 1980s would have been met with surprise and not a small amount of suspicion. But the decision, taken a century after Tom Spillane first opened the place as a bar and general store, certainly seems to have paid off.
It’s located on the Maharees, a three-kilometre sandy spit to the north of the Dingle peninsula that’s a mecca for surfers and, at least if our experience is anything to go by, for families.
Spillane’s website makes reference to the fact that people who were “minded in carrycots in our kitchen as babies” are now returning with their own kids and grandkids, and there were more than a few of those groups already in situ when we arrived. We were glad we’d booked online, as we wouldn’t have got a table otherwise.
A friend who loves his fish and knows more about it than almost anyone I’ve ever met had recommended we eat here, so it was seafood all the way for our starters. Salt and pepper calamari (€8.50) were cooked beautifully, with the thin batter not even slightly greasy, and a salad with some lovely cucumber and coriander ‘spaghetti’ that had a good spicy kick.
Crab claws (€9) had been caught at the nearby pier, were as fresh as a daisy and needed nothing more than the simple salad, marie rose sauce and homemade brown bread they came with.
I was tempted by the scampi and chips (€16.90), but given that my eight-year-old had nicked half my calamari and is a big scampi fan, I reckoned that would mean I’d get to eat hardly any of them.
The hake club burger (€12.50) was the solution, and a brilliant one it was: local hake, coated in panko and then deep-fried but still perfectly tender, served on a brioche bun with bacon, lettuce and a sweet chilli mayo.
I added shrimp for an extra euro (last of the big spenders, that’s me) and in case you’re concerned, the child did get fed, with garlic ciabatta (€2.50), and a homemade burger and chips (€6.50).
Himself tried the seafood bumbu (€18.50), an interesting take on a fish curry, with prawns, mussels, hake, cod and salmon in a West Indies-style sauce made with coconut, ginger, chilli, lemongrass and cashew nuts. The mound of basmati rice it came with made it particularly filling.
Not filling enough not to have dessert, though, especially as the board with the selection written on it had been in our eyeline all through our dinner.
It was a tempting line-up of classics, all priced at €5.50: sherry trifle, rhubarb crumble, a chocolate, Guinness and hazelnut brownie, and carrot cake. There was also a gluten-free coconut and lemon cake for the same price, jelly and ice cream for €3, fresh strawberries, and a kiddies cup with ice cream, a Flake and sauce for €2.50.
The rhubarb crumble took me straight back to my childhood (my granny was a whizz at them), but while the filling was lovely, there was a bit too much crumble, with the result that it was quite heavy. A little tweaking is all that’s needed, though.
With the strawberries, a kiddies’ cup, one glass of wine, a sparkling water and a Diet Coke, our bill came to €83.10 for a meal that had been incredibly tasty, more than generous in size, and served with real friendliness.
The place was absolutely hopping by the time we left around 8pm, with locals coming in for takeaway pizzas and 99s, tourists chancing their arm for tables at the last minute, and visitors who’ve obviously been coming here for years chatting away to each other and the staff.
It was the end of what had been a very sunny bank holiday weekend, during which the tables both inside and out had been, according to our waitress, constantly occupied. I’d wager that everyone working there that night – both front and back of house – was exhausted, but you’d never have guessed from either the service or the food. And for that reason, I suspect this long-established place has an even longer future in front of it.
Starter: seafood soup with homemade brown bread, €5.50
Main course: butternut squash ravioli with sage, olive oil, rocket, Parmesan and pine nuts, €14.50
Dessert: coconut and lemon cake, €5.50
Wine: Gabriella Pinot Grigio, Italy, €23
Dinner for two: €74
Starter: steamed Cromane mussels in a white wine and cream sauce, served with bread for dipping, €9.90
Main course: sirloin steak served with sautéed mushrooms and onions, side salad, chips and choice of sauce, €24.50
Dessert: sherry trifle, €5.50
Wine: Mascota Malbec, Argentina, €27
Dinner for two: €106.80
The wine list here is an well-priced, medium-length offering. There are 18 wines on the main list and a further eight offered by the glass or carafe, under the WineLab wine on tap system.
Every bottle on the list is priced between €21 and €27, with the WineLab glass price being a single €5.50, or €20 for a carafe, for wines including Shiraz, Sauvignon Blanc and a Tempranillo. In the casual dining arena, it represents astonishing value.
One wine for example, Shottesbrooke Shiraz from Australia’s McClaren Vale is priced at €24. In Dublin it appears on lists at around €36. Now I understand rates, wages and so on are a factor between Kerry and Dublin, but a €12 price differential on a single bottle is alarming.
So, value abounds here and our red wine pick would be the Muriel, Reserva, DO Rioja at €26, while our white wine pick would be the Rabbit Island, Sauvignon Blanc, New Zealand at €27.

Galway cash transfer firm closes in on €1 million of funding

Galway fintech PiP iT will ramp up on both funding and staff this year as it takes its unique cash transfer technology into new territories.
Funding will reach close to €1 million when it adds private US and Kuwaiti investor money to Enterprise Ireland funds later this year.
The company, which has devised cash transfer software that helps migrants pay bills and bank money back at home while they are working overseas, partners with international payment platforms to deliver that service cheaply.
Just before the end of 2017 it closed off a seed funding round which attracted investors from Ireland, Britain and the US and it is now working on a follow-up round with institutional investors.
“Now it’s scale-up time and we’re plugging together deals,” said chief executive Ollie Walsh, who co-founded the company with chief operating officer Julian Callaghan.
It is currently operating in markets with big migrant populations including Britain, South Africa and Canada.
Having started building on its idea three years ago, PiP iT launched a year ago when it started transacting in its first market, Ghana, through a partner there called Zeepay. “We processed €300,000 worth of bills, which we were pretty happy with for a new service,” said Walsh.
It partners with payment platforms to provide its service, such as Zympay in Zimbabwe and ImpalaPay in Kenya, and migrants from these and other countries can then pay their bills back home.
“Zympay gets us every utility company in Zimbabwe and all the insurance companies,” said Walsh.
PiP iT has ten agreements signed and 45 more in the pipeline with operations ranging from payment platforms to banks in Africa, the Middle East and India.
“When you’re a migrant you can’t put money into a bank account at home, so we’re talking to some of the big bank chains in developing countries like India,” said Walsh. “It means migrants can go to a post office branch and lodge money into their bank at home.
Unlike money transfer services such as Western Union, PiP iT’s service does not add on an expensive percentage.
“The big difference is cost,” said Walsh. “Our fees are 1.5 per cent. This is a significant saving on the payment, but to put it into some context, for a developing nation, one year’s health insurance in Ghana is $5. Paying a single bill with PiP iT as opposed to remitting cash could pay for health insurance for a family member.
“We have agreements signed that will get us into ten more African nations this year and most of the Middle East will be live this year including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain,” Walsh said.
“And we’re in negotiations with potential partners in the United States and India.”

Highlight: Varadkar: ‘Everyone deserves a second chance, and this is Ireland’s second chance’ 
Body


After 35 years of bitter social division, the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment has revealed a momentous shift in Irish public attitudes, with a huge majority voting to liberalise the abortion laws.
The removal of the Eighth Amendment to the constitution is a decisive shift away from traditional mores, with the outcome stunning those involved in the campaign.
The prospect of an urban/rural and intergenerational divide failed to materialise, to the surprise of both the Yes and No camps.
The country voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment in huge numbers, delivering a result much wider than opinion polls in the run-up to the referendum had forecast.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is planning to accompany the forthcoming abortion legislation with a wider support package which includes the provision of free contraception to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies.
“A hundred years since women gained the vote, we as a nation have spoken, and spoken loud and clear. We trust women. We respect their decisions. Everyone deserves a second chance, and this is Ireland’s second chance to treat everyone equally and respectful from now on,” Varadkar told The Sunday Business Post yesterday.
Minister for Health Simon Harris will seek cabinet approval on Tuesday to start drafting the abortion bill. A senior government source said it was “doable” to have it through the Dáil and the Seanad by the end of this year.
The result of the referendum has increased the likelihood of the next general election not taking place until the spring of 2019 at the earliest. Varadkar is understood to have ruled out a snap election, believing it would be “opportunistic” in the aftermath of the referendum.
Senior sources in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil said both parties wanted to get the abortion legislation implemented by the end of the year, as well as passing the third budget in October and dealing with the final Brexit summit the same month.
The result is a boost for Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who had come under fire internally for supporting a Yes vote in opposition to the majority of Fianna Fáil TDs and senators.
A Fianna Fáil source said many of its No-voting TDs were likely to change their minds. “I’d say a lot of them will support it. It’s such an emphatic result. And others will abstain. It won’t be in any way obstructive,” the source said.
Together For Yes campaign manager Deirdre Duffy said the notion of a very divided nation was gone.
“We did think we would have a bigger job of healing the country. That’s not the case now. You still have to show respect, and we all have to live together afterwards,” she said.
With the abortion legislation due to be passed into law by the end of the year, the referendum campaign has given further momentum to those pushing for more social change. Independent Alliance Minister of State John Halligan said he was ready to re-introduce his “right to die” bill for people with terminal illnesses within a month.
“What I would be asking for is a constructive debate on this. It’s not a question of people who want to die by suicide. It’s people who are terminally ill,” he said.
Halligan unsuccessfully tried to bring in a “right to die” bill in 2015 to assist Marie Fleming, a former university lecturer in the late stages of multiple sclerosis. As a minister, he cannot bring his revised bill into the Dáil himself, but two opposition TDs have offered to do it for him.
Independent TD Mattie McGrath, a vocal opponent of the Eighth Amendment referendum, said that while he respected the will of the people, he would table amendments to the legislation to protect the unborn.
The referendum result will have repercussions for women in the North, which has the strictest abortion laws in the UK. Sinn Féin is determined to push for an end to the ban on abortion in the North, once the Northern Assembly is back up and running.
“We’re an all-island party. Women in Newry should have the same rights as women in Dundalk,” said a Sinn Féin spokesman. Given the scale of the Yes win, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald is expected to get party backing for the new abortion law.

Gillick Brothers get go-ahead for housing on old Chivers site

The Gillick brothers, who bought the nine-acre former Chivers factory site formerly owned by developer Liam Carroll have been successful in getting the Dublin City councillors to rezone it for housing.
Maurice and Andrew Gillick now plan to seek planning for the site on Dublin’s northside to build around 250 apartments and houses under new fast track planning rules and say that it will be build-to-rent affordable housing.
The pair are from Glasnevin, but are involved in mainly commercial property development in London through a company called Platinum Land
Their Irish development company Veni Vidi Vice bought the site from Carroll’s receivers and then hired a consultancy firm called McCutcheon Halley Walsh which lobbied local councillors to support its rezoning from enterprise and recreational amenity, open space and green networks.
“We prefer our work to talk for us and we typically avoid the limelight,” said Maurice Gillick when contacted.
“This is a very exciting project and we are committed to do a great job here and create a great place for people to live and develop their lives.
“We bought a derelict commercial site that had no prospect of reuse and if it was would be detrimental to the locality.
“At this stage we have successfully had the land rezoned to allow us to create an impressive residential scheme and an impressive three-acre linear park.
“The benefits are both to the local established community and also the many people that are suffering with the housing shortage.”
He said that the housing would be affordable. “Our aim from the start has been to create normal housing for normal people.
“To deliver that as quickly and to get it to the most needy faster we are pursuing a build-to-rent planning application.
“We have engaged with Dublin City Council and we are taking their and the local community ambitions, wishes, desires and input on board to create a great scheme.”
It will be a mix of housing from studios to four-bedroom homes, he said, and will include a creche, park, sports facilities, and a cinema and club room.
The brothers have also engaged with the Housing Agency.
The brothers are also looking for other opportunities in Dublin, he said.
Gillick dismissed concerns expressed by some locals and councillors that the site could simply be sold on speculatively now that it was rezoned.
“We do not flip sites and none of our companies have done so,” he said.
“We are progressing rapidly through the planning phase and would hope to have a scheme before An Bord Pleanála using the Strategic Housing Development legislation in the summer.
“We remain committed to our original goal to deliver housing to alleviate the housing crisis, this was our aim when we bought the site.”

Highlight: Marketing events will combine Dublin traditions with World Cucumber Day 
Body


The team at Hendrick’s Gin were feeling fruity when they got the inspiration for their latest marketing campaign.
The gin, which is usually served with a slice of cucumber, celebrated World Cucumber Day for the first time last year with a small event in Ireland that was open to media, trade and influencers only. This year, World Cucumber Day falls on June 14 and the gin brand plans to expand the reach of the campaign by allowing consumers to engage with it.
It is running three mini activations that will take place around three historic Dublin traditions as part of the campaign. This will include a partnership with traditional fish and chip shop Leo Burdocks, which will serve battered cucumbers to mark the occasion, while a horse-drawn carriage entitled ‘The Chariot of the Curious’ will ferry people around St Stephen’s Green before bidding them farewell with a token for a Hendrick’s cocktail nearby.
Among the traditional street flower vendors, Dubliners will be able to pick up a “bizarre bouquet”, which is a fruity floral arrangement. There will also be an event that will seek to immerse attendees in the brand’s world.
These celebrations will culminate in a grand event, which Hendrick’s says will be open to cucumber enthusiasts, which will take place in the Cucumber Hatchery in Urban Plant Life in Dublin 8. There will also be some smaller-scale activity taking place outside Dublin.
Laura Hallinan, senior brand manager of Hendrick’s Gin, said: “As always at Hendrick’s, we like to do things a little differently to celebrate the curious combination of Hendrick’s and this fine fruit. This world cucumber day, we’re excited to bring the secrets of the cucumber to the streets of Dublin and hope to welcome many Hendrick’s neophytes to the the Cucumber Hatchery on this day of comprehensive cucumber celebration.”
One hundred tickets to this event will be made available to the public from tomorrow at 12pm on Eventbrite.

Glanbia Co-Op members voice concerns ahead of agm

Highlight: Angry farmers claim that Glanbia Co-Op funds are being used by Glanbia plc to support milk prices 
Body


Rebel Glanbia Co-Op members have formed a group amid concerns about their treatment including the price the co-op pays famers for milk and how it funds various support schemes.
The members have met a number of times, and three of them based in the south-east decided to go public about their concerns when contacted for comment by The Sunday Business Post ahead of Glanbia’s agm this Wednesday.
The rebel groups claim the group’s co-op arm is paying them less than they should get, and that the co-op’s resources are being used to fund various support schemes.
Glanbia Co-Op has a 36.5 per cent share in global nutrition group Glanbia plc and a 60 per cent stake in dairy processor Glanbia Ingredients Ireland.
Waterford-based member Michael Veale said he was a lifelong association with co-ops and had an average shareholding in the Glanbia Co-Op. Average shareholders typically have about 2,500 shares.
“The co-op is only supporting some of its members. There are approximately 15,000 shareholders in the co-op, of whom 6,000 approximately are A1 shareholders [which means they can vote and attend the agm],” Veale said. “That leaves some 9,000 shareholders who have no representation and no voice. Why should their equity be used to support milk prices and feed prices through the Loyalty Scheme?”
“I’m being told by the co-op that they are doing me a big favour by increasing the dividend to 13 cent per share,” he said.
“Co-op members are being crucified. They have only got €4.8 million of the €22.4 million raised from the last dividend paid by the plc.”
Veale said he had “lost confidence” in the co-op’s ability to look after his interests.
“Dairy farmers need every cent at the moment. But, what you have is a Glanbia Plc which cannot compete with other co-ops, they should get a decent price for milk, and they should get paid by the company who buys the milk, not to be topped up by dividends from other shares,” he said.
“Glanbia is a fantastic company. We were born with the co-op in our veins, it is the life-blood of our communities.
“The co-op has looked after us when times were very tough and there is an older generation who built this co-op, who no longer have a say. That is not fair. The co-op ethos is totally gone,” he said.
“If the dividend is paid out to co-op members, there would not be a problem. If fairness prevails, then we wouldn’t have a problem.”
Morgan Sheehan, another co-op member and shareholder, said he had been elected to the advisory council of Glanbia Co-Op for his region in 2012.
“I was elected to the Advisory Council of Glanbia six years ago. A lot of the people who I canvassed at that time have now ceased milk production. I was elected by them,” Sheehan said.
“What I see now is their equity is being used to support my milk and all the other active farmers’ milk prices. That’s totally wrong.
“Glanbia Ireland should be paying for its own milk, it shouldn’t be using supports.
“All the other co-ops pay for their own milk on the merits of the business. Glanbia has got into a habit of announcing a monthly milk price and then supporting that price with co-op funds. That has been going on for three, four years.”
“That support payment [for milk prices] for last month was 3 cent a litre and the cost to the co-op was €7 million approximately. That money is coming from [co-op] shareholder funds. The dividend from the plc was increased this year. The co-op will receive €22.4 million. That will be nearly wiped out supporting milk for three months.”
Sheehan said he was also concerned about corporate governance, and about the fact that the chief executive and chairman were the same for the plc and the co-op. “There needs to be an independent board. They are not representing the co-op shareholder – there is a huge conflict of interest,” he alleged.
“Glanbia Ireland has the most modern milk-processing plant in Europe funded by all co-op shareholders. Despite having the biggest volume they consistently pay the lowest base price for milk in Ireland and need the co-op to come and subsidise it to bring the price back to mid-table mediocrity.”
Edmond Phelan, a long-term shareholder and customer of Glanbia Co-Op, said he agreed with his fellow farmers from Waterford.
“I started out with 100 shares, left to me by my father. But I bought many more, I invested in many more. Glanbia is a great company, but I feel like it has lost its way,” he said.
“I think that the total dividend that comes from Glanbia plc to the co-op should be paid out in full to its members, like it is in other co-ops like Kerry Group. To my knowledge the board members are accountable to shareholders, not to the suppliers. If I was a shareholder in Roadstone, I would not get my concrete cheaper, but I would get my dividend. The same should apply in Glanbia.”
Phelan said he was “mad as hell”, and called for things to change.
“They should spin out the rest of the shares in the co-op, the whole lot. That is the only way that I am going to get my money. The dry stock farmer is the poor relation of the dairy farmer in this – the co-op are taking from the less well-off to pay the better off.”
“The co-op board should have different members to the plc board. There needs to be an independent board in the co-op. You have a board who meet on behalf of the plc in the morning and then, after lunch, they have a co-op meeting where they have to make decisions on an issue brought up that morning. How can they represent both?”
“Most of Glanbia’s plc profits now come from the US. Over the years, my investment has helped set up the US operations but now, I am getting very little dividends. Instead, my money is being used to prop up the milk prices,” he claimed. “The rest of the money is being recycled. This is our money.”
Phelan said he was surprised that competitors of Glanbia were not more concerned at what was going on. “We are going to raise all these issues at the agm,” he said.
A spokesperson for Glanbia Co-Op said: “Overall, in the period 2012 to 2017 the Co-op has returned almost €700 million in value to members.
“As much as 85 per cent of the value that has been returned to members has been on the basis of shares owned, and is non-patronage-based.
“That said, support for active members is a key pillar of Glanbia Co-op’s strategy, and is absolutely consistent with basic co-operative principles. Patronage supports have been used in times of extreme market conditions and severe weather events – as most recently seen in spring 2018.
“Patronage support in all cases is approved by members at general meetings in accordance with the rules of the Society.”
The spokesperson said this way of doing business was “overwhelmingly” supported by members at a meeting a year ago. “The current model provides that dividends from profits in Glanbia Ireland will be assigned to active farmers,” she said. “This is fair and supports the growth of the co-op’s investment in Glanbia Ireland, which is in the interests of all shareholders.
“The co-op operates a progressive dividend policy. The dividend has increased steadily in recent years (4 cent per share in 2011, 10 cent per share in 2017 with a current proposal to increase to 13 cent per share). The board will continue to review its dividend policy on an ongoing basis.
“Further ‘special’ dividends have been paid at certain times, including payment of 26 cent per co-op share which is being distributed at present.
“Glanbia Ireland pays a market-based price, based on a proposal that was approved overwhelmingly by Society members in May 2017.
“In accordance with the model which was then approved, Glanbia Co-Op ‘ring-fences’ dividend monies received from Glanbia Ireland for the provision of supports back to active farmers. Again, this reflects a basic co-operative principle.”
On the issue of corporate governance, the spokesperson said: “The board of Glanbia plc and the co-op are different entities with different members. For 2018, the Glanbia plc board will comprise 16 directors, four of whom are executive directors of Glanbia plc and 14 non-executive directors.
“Of the 12 non-execs, eight will be nominated by the co-op in 2018. The co-op board has 15 members in total, including the group managing director. The existing governance structure has served both the plc and the Society well to date.”
Glanbia Co-Op concluded: “The Society is well served by its current membership structure which comprises 11 regional committees. It listens closely to members and seeks feedback from them on an ongoing basis. Finally, any and all matters raised by members will be addressed at next week’s agm.”

Body


Reviewed This Week
A Very English Scandal: BBC One
Patrick Melrose: Sky Atlantic
Stressed: RTÉ One
Chief among the pleasures of A Very English Scandal (BBC One) is not the rather lazy title, which seeks to make the Englishness of the story unique and is used as liberally across the water as the equally clichéd ‘The Great British . . .’
To my surprise, the chief pleasure is Hugh Grant, or rather Hugh Grant impersonating the lantern-jawed, Jeremy Thorpe, charismatic former leader of the British Liberal Party who, in 1979, was tried and acquitted of incitement and conspiracy to murder his alleged former lover Norman Scott, played here by Ben Whishaw.
Such is the often incongruous nature of the actor’s life that the pair recently appeared together in Paddington 2, with Whishaw voicing the loveable bear and Grant playing a fading star reduced to doing dog food commercials.
If you have tended to dismiss Grant as a lightweight, always playing the same floppy-haired Englishman with a lopsided grin, the eternal juvenile lead in countless romcoms, it’s time to think again. I admit to having entertained the prejudice, but here Grant delivers an entirely believable portrait of a man impaled on the tines of his own desire, at a time in 1960s Britain when homosexuality was a criminal offence. It’s an utterly engaging and absorbing portrayal in which Grant, quite uncannily, manages physically to resemble Thorpe.
Thorpe always denied a sexual relationship with Scott who, during the mid-1960s, and after his association with Thorpe, worked for a time in Dublin, where he assumed the surname Scott. When Thorpe met him, he was Norman Josief. This was the least convincingly realised segment of the first episode: Scott apparently worked as a male model here, appearing in photoshoots for a style magazine called Accolade, which I’d never heard of.
According to this dramatisation, it was at this time that Thorpe’s sidekick, Liberal MP and Methodist lay preacher Peter Bessell (Alex Jennings), began to pay off Scott, who had written an alarmingly detailed letter to Thorpe’s mother describing his sexual relations with her son. Jennings’ performance is also excellent and reminds me, in style, a little of Dirk Bogarde, the 1950s romcom equivalent of Grant. A secretly gay man, Bogarde courageously played the lead in Victim (1961), a film about homosexual blackmail.
Old Etonian and Oxford graduate Thorpe was a very capable television journalist, as well as a dynamic force in the threadbare Liberal Party. He yanked it up by its principles, delivering hard-hitting speeches on European integration, post-colonial responsibility and the Labour government’s attitude to white rule in Rhodesia. But even after he became Liberal leader, it was never enough for the Liberals seriously to dent either Labour or the Tories.
The tricky thing about this version of events, written by Russell T Davies and directed by Stephen Frears (who aside from making The Van and The Snapper also appropriately made Dangerous Liaisons), is that while Thorpe died in 2014, denying everything to the last, Scott is very much alive and living in Dartmoor.
He claims that he survived an attempt by Thorpe to have him shot by an amateur hitman. However, in the words of Oliver Goldsmith, “The dog it was that died” – for, after the hitman shot Rinka, Scott’s Great Dane, his gun jammed. For the English public, the shooting of a dog added emotional value to an already sensational trial.
As told, A Very English Scandal is the classic story of a privileged, brilliant public man who falls for an emotionally fragile youth. A dangerous liaison indeed, some six years before sexual acts in private between two adult males became legal in England and Wales.
Writer Russell T Davies makes no bones about Thorpe’s dominant sexuality. He is portrayed as dandyish, brilliant and charming, but predatory and ruthless, while taking ridiculous risks by putting his feelings in writing. His marriage is shown as having been driven by political expediency. Thorpe was married twice, the first producing a son, Rupert. Thorpe’s first wife, Caroline Allpass, died in a car accident after just two years of marriage.
There are two more episodes, the next one tonight. Catch them if you can.
If you’d hoped to see Benedict Cumberbatch thrashing hotel rooms in the second episode of Patrick Melrose (Sky Atlantic, Now TV), you’ll have been disappointed.
This was an adaptation of the first book in the series, Never Mind, which centres on a dinner party in the family’s home in the south of France in 1967, when Patrick, still a child, is played by Sebastian Maltz. The edited bitchiness of the novel’s dialogue still manages to capture the dissolute nature of the company, and their casual prejudice, in one case directed at psychologist Victor Eisen (James Fleet), who has left early.
“Almost nothing is as entertaining as the contortions of a clever Jewish snob,” says Patrick’s appalling father David (Hugo Weaving), who, that afternoon, had sexually abused his son.
“Very broad-minded of you to have one in the house at all,” says Nicholas Pratt (Pip Torrens).
Cumberbatch, meanwhile, had just a couple of brief scenes, shuddering cold turkey on the back seat of a car, and then being put to bed. Expect a greater presence in tomorrow night’s episode.
There’s something of a history in RTÉ of one-woman social documentaries. One of the first, and still the most entertaining, was Maia Dunphy’s Merlot and Me on RTÉ Two in 2013.
But Jennifer O’Connell’s Stressed (RTÉ One) was given altogether more serious treatment, shown on the national broadcaster’s main station over two nights. It revealed a wide range of research being done in this country on the effects of stress and how to cope with it, and was firmly bolted together by research boffins, therapists and other experts. In learning to cope with stress and anxiety, O’Connell said, “the reward can be a life better lived”.
Five volunteers revealed their stressed lifestyles: Conor Higgins, a chef who owns a restaurant and two cafés in Dublin; Jonathan Hayes, a Galway entrepreneur; Steffi Skehan, a secondary school teacher; John Farrell, a mature student of nursing at DCU with a family, a two-hour commute and part-time work at weekends; and Ger Renton, a full-time carer for 16-year-old Ethan, the eldest of her three sons, who has Hunter’s Syndrome.
Clearly, juggling family life with long commutes and a sense of having to be permanently available to respond to calls or emails are common stress factors for many. In Renton’s case, anxiety about Ethan’s future was a continuing source of stress.
O’Connell, a journalist with her own communications business, was the sixth volunteer, though she had less to say about her personal situation. She did, however, take part in some of the tests. One, unique to her, involved her swallowing a psychobiotic substance, a bacteria from the gut that’s claimed to be beneficial for mental health.
After four weeks of this, repeating a stress test she had taken earlier, she was found to have lower levels of the stress hormone Cortisol. So there is something to the old idea of gut instinct.
In the end, short of issuing the entire country with psychobiotics, which I could have done with before the stress of so many abortion referendum television debates, it seems to be down to coping strategies and mindfulness – a concept I’ve so far had difficulty getting my head around.

Hibernia boss says Reits need €500m to be viable

Property players eyeing a public flotation should aim for valuations of at least half a billion euro to attract investors, the chief executive of Hibernia Reit has said.
Kevin Nowlan, who leads the publicly quoted investor, was among the first to bet on a recovery in Irish property values through a flotation on stock markets when he raised €365 million for Hibernia in 2013.
“My view would be that you need to be over €500 million. That probably means you need to have €300 million of stock and €200 million of cash,” he said.
“I think the challenge is scale. If you’re too small, people aren’t interested.”
Since flotation, Hibernia Reit has grown rapidly and become one of the most aggressive purchasers of largely office stock in the state.
In addition to new builds, it has renovated existing stock and rented it out to large multinationals, such as Twitter, which has its European headquarters in a Hibernia building. Last week, it posted net rental income for the year to the end of March of €45.7 million, up 15.1 per cent on the previous year.
Its portfolio is now valued at around €1.31 billion.
Irish commercial property market watchers are expecting a host of new initial public offerings as investors seek to either crystallise their Irish positions or possibly exit the market. Floats are expected across a variety of market segments, including retail, hotels and industrial.
However, some outfits have found it difficult to convince investors of the merits of their proposals. Core Industrial Reit, which had planned to invest in warehouses and other industrial buildings, abandoned plans for a €225 million float in March.
Market sources also suggested that investor interest in a second industrial and office-focused reit, Yew Grove, is proving softer than the founders anticipated.
Speaking about what makes prospective reits attractive to investors, Nowlan said: “You need to have enough income. People need to know what they’re buying into, they need to know what the strategy is and they need to know the portfolio you’re presenting to them is consistent with that strategy.
“The portfolio has to have enough income to wash its face and give you a decent enough initial dividend.”
He also welcomed building reforms designed to encourage build-to-rent apartments.
“We’re not going to solve this just by our domestic house-building industry.”
Nowlan also said that large, central tracts of land should be focused on the rental sector.
“We need the Glass Bottle site to be a predominantly rental project. A lot of these new companies coming in want people to live in and around where they’re working,” he said.
“It’s a really important project, and a lot of people will want it predominantly for sale, and I don’t think that’s the right thing.”

The 234-room hotel is being built on Dean Street, close to St Patrick’s Cathedral and the corner of Kevin Street. It is due to open in May 2019.
Owned by the O’Sullivan family, the Hodson Bay Group owns and operates the Hodson Bay Hotel and Sheraton Athlone Hotel as well as the Galway Bay Hotel.
On a visit to the construction site in the Liberties yesterday, Jason Ballard, Hyatt’s regional vice-president of operations for Europe and North Africa, said: “Working with Hodson Bay Group, which already owns and operates several hotels, fits our European strategy of aligning ourselves with key players in the hotel industry in the various markets, with the goal of building long-term relationships. We believe that this is the start of a very strong relationship for Hyatt in Ireland.”
The one-acre site was assembled by the Hodson Bay Group over recent years and has more than 60 metres of street frontage comprising ten individual street-front properties.
The introduction of a high-standard four-star property on this gateway site will make a step change and will bring with it significant incremental footfall, which will provide the surrounding businesses with a notable increase in ancillary revenues.
The proposed development expects to cater for 150,000 to 200,000 guests/delegates on an annual basis, which would have a knock-on boost to the surrounding areas of Dublin 8.

Students might be left praying for divine intervention when the Pope comes to Ireland, as there are fears that his visit could cause havoc for those searching for accommodation in Dublin this August.
Pope Francis will visit Dublin on August 25 and 26 as part of the World Meeting of Families. “With Leaving Cert results coming out in mid-August and the first round of the CAO out on August 20, we do expect to see a significant number of students looking for accommodation that week,” said Michael Kerrigan, president of the Union of Students in Ireland.
“We would be advising students to search for accommodation much earlier than late August, as many student accommodation blocks are already full for the upcoming year.”
Thea Mackenzie of Brookman Town Homes, which offers serviced properties for short term letting in Dublin, said there tended to be a last-minute rush of people searching for accommodation at the end of every summer.
“Every year in mid-August there is a scramble of people looking for either student accommodation or accommodation for families who want to relocate ahead of the school year,” she said. “This year the Pope is coming, so this will be a problem for those who are trying to relocate at that time of year as Dublin will be packed.”
She said that a lot of students might find that they will not be able to get accommodation until after the last week in August, as many people will be renting out their accommodation on Airbnb while the Pope is in the city.

How to give and receive feedback effectively

Highlight: Many managers avoid giving feedback or procrastinate on annual performance reviews due to the fear of the fallout of the conversation
Body


Giving and receiving feedback is still one of the major struggles that exists in all organisations.
My work on leadership programmes has provided me with some insights on the common challenges in this area and solutions that have been used to meet them.
Many managers avoid giving feedback or procrastinate on annual performance reviews due to the fear of the fallout of the conversation. People often avoid getting feedback out of fear of what they may hear. Other people ask for feedback but are then unable to handle it.
In Ireland, we tend to be indirect when giving feedback, or swing to the opposite side of the spectrum to be too direct.
The challenge is to understand how to overcome these difficulties, especially if we personalise the feedback and it hurts our feelings.
First, it is really important to understand the importance of feedback to you. Most people will have blind spots and areas they need to develop.
The way to overcome this is through receiving feedback, coaching or shared discovery, like group work or the use of psychometric tools. The higher your self-awareness, the higher your emotional intelligence will become.
Research shows that 90 per cent of top performers have higher emotional intelligence and are far more likely to be more productive in their roles, and have increased career promotions and higher salaries.
Indeed, it’s estimated that emotional intelligence is responsible for 58 per cent of your job performance.
The role of emotional intelligence is therefore crucial to your career, and receiving feedback is an integral part of the development process.
People react in different ways when they receive feedback. They may go into defence mode, shut down and refute the message being delivered.
Others may only listen and acknowledge the nice things, which is the danger of the feedback sandwich (start nice, deliver tough message and finish with something nice). This of course could be a coping mechanism.
Yet others can personalise the message reading it as an attack on their ego or self-identity. This rocks their confidence.
Being able to listen and unlock the message that is being provided in the feedback conversation is key to high performance.
The lessons that I have learned from working with clients during executive coaching or in group facilitation are as follows:
•	See the feedback conversation as a learning tool. You are learning about yourself, and about others’ expectations/preferences, ways to improve your skills and enhance your emotional intelligence.
•	Recognise that if people are confident in giving you feedback, there is a positive intention behind the message. Usually, people want you to fulfil your potential.
•	Is the feedback true and objective? Seek out people who you trust will be honest with you. Follow the rule of thumb: if the overall majority agree there is something to work on, there must be something in the message.
•	Understand the reasons behind your defensiveness. Understand triggers and why you may have a strong reaction to the feedback. Working with a coach could help you with this.
•	If you do tend to personalise feedback, recognise this as a tendency in yourself. Take time to process the feedback and wait for the emotions to settle.
•	If you know you are sensitive to feedback, prepare yourself. Stay objective and ask for a follow-up meeting so that you can process the information and have a productive conversation.
•	Seek specific feedback and gain clarity on details and expectations so you can make a development plan.
•	See your development plan as a challenge. Set goals to achieve this and before you know it you will be on a positive path to personal success.
•	Remember, feedback is essential to high performance. If you are in pursuit of excellence, the only way to learn is to find ways to improve.
Whether you are a pro golfer, an Olympic athlete or a Six Nations grand slam winner, feedback and analysis of your performance is crucial to your personal success.

HSE refuses to disclose smear test quality data

Body


The HSE has refused to say whether it ensured outsourced cervical screening tests had to be examined for a minimum amount of time.
The HSE has been criticised for the decision to outsource much of the national cervical screening programme to private operators - some of whom are based in the US.
This newspaper has - for the past two weeks - asked the HSE whether it insisted that the labs it contracted to examine cervical cytology slides spent a minimum amount of time on the initial interpretation of each slide.
Laboratories in Ireland spend a minimum of six minutes on the initial examination of each cytology smear.
Dr Irene Regan, vice-president of the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine, said the six-minute standard in Ireland was one of a number of key quality-assurance mechanisms that were in place.
“The minimum standard in Ireland is six minutes. In general, it takes an awful lot longer, but you need to have a minimum standard to ensure someone examines the smear thoroughly. It is a very rigorous process,” said Regan.
The HSE has refused to provide copies of the tenders it issued for the provision of cervical check services, or copies of contracts awarded.
In recent weeks, it emerged that 209 women with cervical cancer received false negative test results (a test result which wrongly indicates that a particular condition or attribute is absent) in Ireland.
Vicky Phelan received a €2.5 million settlement from the US lab that misinterpreted her smear test.
The CervicalCheck programme currently uses three laboratories to process cervical screening: Quest Diagnostics in the US; MedLab Pathology in Dublin; and the Coombe Hospital in Dublin.
The HSE has claimed that it did not know how many of the 209 cases were examined in private or US labs.
Medical experts have questioned how this could be the case more than one month into the CervicalCheck controversy.
Regan said that if the cases were distributed across all laboratories, it could be seen as a limitation of the cytology test itself, as no screening test was 100 per cent accurate.
She said that if the false negatives were concentrated in one laboratory, then this required further investigation.
The HSE has provided information in respect of the positive predictive value reported by each of the labs it is using.
Positive predictive value is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. Those figures do not show any significant variation.
The HSE has also provided data about the percentage of high-grade abnormalities being detected by the labs used.
One lab was detecting twice as many high-grade abnormalities as the others, according to the most recent data available.
The labs have not been identified by the HSE, but it is widely believed that the lab detecting more high-grade abnormalities was the Coombe.

INM’s new investor may give O’Brien an opening

Highlight: It is unclear whether Goodman’s move is a long-term investment for the beef baron, or a short-term play 
Body


A billionaire telecoms mogul. A billionaire financier and dealmaker. Now, a billionaire beef baron. Larry Goodman’s decision to join Denis O’Brien and Dermot Desmond on the share register at Independent News & Media has certainly set chins wagging in corporate Ireland, particularly as the company is currently attempting to fend off the appointment of High Court inspectors to investigate its activities.
At this point, it remains unclear whether Goodman, a septuagenarian businessman, is making a long-term strategic investment in the business, or whether he is simply making a financial investment by buying stock in a company that many believe is undervalued.
Either way, the timing of the move, emerging in the same week that Paul Connolly, O’Brien’s last remaining nominee on the board of INM, announced his departure, has raised significant questions about the longer-term shareholder structure of the media group.
Depending on whom you talk to, Denis O’Brien is either expected to start selling some of his 29 per cent holding, or go in the opposite direction and, along with his fellow billionaires, take the company private.
O’Brien has not revealed his intentions, and Goodman and Desmond are not known for sharing their corporate strategies.
Certainly, many market observers have long been championing the merits of taking the business off the stock market.
Its cash pile, coupled with a weak share price, makes the company attractive for a buyout.
O’Brien and Desmond control 45 per cent of the business. Goodman has a further 2 per cent. Even allowing for a premium of 30 to 40 per cent per share, they could effectively buy the group with the cash on its balance (€91.5 million at last count), a small bridging loan and perhaps a working capital revolver. Such a deal would be easily funded, based on INM’s annual free cash flow of €30 million.
Certainly, some of the smaller shareholders have been agitating for change for a number of months now, arguing that the plethora of recent controversies is impacting on the stock’s performance.
Dutch investor Farringdon Capital Management, which owns close to 7 per cent of the company, recently dispatched a letter to INM seeking urgent and dramatic action, including using the publisher’s own €90 million cash pile to restructure the shareholder register, or alternatively to encourage fresh investment.
Any such move would raise the possibility of O’Brien exiting the company. As 29 per cent shareholder, he would be affected by any buyouts or new investment.
With all attention on Goodman, the exit of Connolly from the board was largely overlooked last week. However, the exit is significant given he was the last remaining O’Brien nominee to the board, with both Lucy Gaffney and Leslie Buckley departing earlier.
Analysts are now watching with interest to see whether the businessman appoints another nominee to the board. A quick appointment will copperfasten the view that O’Brien is hanging on for the long term.
Against the backdrop of the ownership question, the company is also seeking to reposition itself to deal with declining circulation, falling advertising, poor digital growth and the cost of libel claims.
INM is not alone in these issues in the industry, but as Ireland’s largest newspaper publisher, it has drawn more attention.
A key focus will be driving digital revenues. Internally, INM believes it could make up to €70 million from digital per annum if it took steps like introducing a paywall for premium content and targeting the global Irish disapora.
INM’s Newspread is a barn-storming business whose success has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding its newspaper titles. It too is another obvious area for growth and continued consolidation.
Larry Goodman is the wildcard in all this. He has endured controversies and tribunals - and emerged stronger in the long term.
Goodman saw his beef empire Goodman International teeter in the early 1990s, like INM did almost two decades later, on the brink of collapse. Skilfully and against the odds he guided his business through crisis after crisis to emerge as one of Ireland’s richest men.
This experience will undoubtedly prove useful as an investor in INM which is facing huge challenges from both the investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and structural changes such as the decline of print.
The ODCE investigation, however, is weighing large on shareholders. While expressing concern at some of the allegations, chairman Murdoch MacLennan outlined why the company was objecting to the appointment of inspectors.
“In considering its legal strategy, the board is acutely conscious that the appointment of inspectors to INM would by necessity result in a very considerable ongoing cost to INM and a continuing requirement to devote substantial resources to dealing with the inspectorate,” he said earlier this month.
Halting the ODCE in the courts would be a considerable coup for INM (not to mention a devastating blow to the ODCE, from which I do not believe it would recover). But if the ODCE wins, it will be interesting to see the reaction of the three billionaire shareholders.

Company: Macroom Buffalo Mozzarella
Done Deal: €1m Aldi contract
The clincher: “We are now expanding into making other cheeses and we hope to begin exporting product for the first time next year” – Johnny Lynch, founder
Macroom Buffalo Mozzarella is to supply more than 500,000 packets of cheese made in west Cork to Aldi, under a two-year deal agreed this month with the German retailer.
Valued at €1 million, the contract extends an existing supply deal dating back three years. It will see Macroom increase the amount of cheese it supplies to Aldi’s 130 outlets in Ireland.
“The security and certainty provided by our partnership with Aldi has enabled us to invest in and substantially grow our business over the last three years,” said founder Johnny Lynch.
The cheese is sold under Aldi’s own brand Specially Selected. It won a gold at the World Cheese Awards last November, beating 3,000 cheeses from 30 countries.
“Before Aldi listed our product in its stores, we primarily sold it at farmers’ markets and to restaurants around the country,” said Lynch. “We are now expanding into making other cheeses, including buffalo ricotta, buffalo Greek-style cheese and buffalo halloumi for retail, and we hope to begin exporting product for the first time next year.”
On foot of the new Aldi contract, Lynch will grow the herd of buffalo on his west Cork farm by 40 per cent to close to 300 animals. He established the company in 2009 when he brought 30 buffalo from Cremona in northern Italy to his 150-acre dairy farm in Cill na Martra near Macroom.
He employs six people, and is Ireland’s only producer of artisan buffalo mozzarella. Lynch makes mozzarella, halloumi and Greek-style salad cheese at a purpose-built facility on the farm.
The buffalo halloumi and Greek-style salad cheeses are sold to hotels and restaurants through distributors. Lynch has 200 buffalo on the farm calving year-round.
Finbar McCarthy, the retailer group’s buying director said: “We recently launched our new Grow with Aldi supplier development programme in partnership with Bord Bia, to support Irish food and drink businesses in developing their products with the end goal of securing a national listing with Aldi.
“Our aim is to provide the necessary mentoring to enable food and drink businesses to realise their potential and, hopefully, unearth the next standout Irish supplier like Macroom Buffalo Mozzarella.”

Irish Water set to restart water meter installation programme

The government is planning to get Irish Water to re-start water meter installation to promote water conservation.
The water metering programme was abandoned in 2017 due to intense protests in certain parts of the country.
But although around 880,000 households got water meters at a cost of €455 million, there are still another 330,000 homes yet to be metered.
The government’s new water policy statement reveals it has committed to re-starting the metering programme as part of the “promotion of water conservation” during the period up to 2025.
“This will involve the priorisation of multi-faceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost-effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to fix customer side leaks,” it said.
However, the policy statement does emphasise that the metering of homes will be aimed at conserving water rather than for “revenue raising purposes” and that efforts will be made to incentivise households to sign up voluntarily for meters. There are another 300,000 households in apartments which cannot be metered individually – but they will get bulk meters.
This is in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee on the future of domestic water charges in their report last year. Charges for excessive water use are due to come into force in January next year.
A government source said there was no intention of putting in more meters to raise money for Irish Water.
“You can’t go opening up old wounds. The only reason charges will be introduced is to prevent the wilful waste of water,” he said. As part of the water conservation effort, the first fix scheme – which provides free repair for the first leaks detected on a household’s property – is going to be retained.
Independent Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh, who chaired the Oireachtas committee on water charges, said it was welcome that its recommendations were being heeded. He said the existing water meters were still the most effective way of detecting leaks.
“Around 45 per cent of all water that goes through the pipes is wasted. The only real way we can detect where there is significant leakage of water is by metering it,” he said.
The water policy statement notes that €8.5 billion is going to be invested in upgrading the country’s creaking water and wastewater infrastructure up to 2028. But the total investment required by Irish Water up to the mid 2030s is estimated to be €14 billion.
Ó Céidigh said there was an urgent need to provide safe water to protect people’s health.

It’s time for the civil service to move out and move on

Highlight: The crumbling eyesore that is Hawkins House is no place for a modern Department of Health. The public sector must embrace change – including new offices 
Body


The staff at drug company Shire were all smiles when the then taoiseach, Enda Kenny, opened their new global headquarters last year. The icing on the cake was the extra 150 employees being hired as the company expanded in Ireland. The completely revamped, Scott Tallon Walker-designed, building on Lower Baggot Street, called Miesian Plaza, represents a much more significant presence than their old HQ in Citywest on the outskirts of Dublin.
For all of the enthusiasm of the employees at Shire, a different attitude has been adopted by some of the civil servants at the Department of Health who were also due to move into the much bigger building on the site, now owned and redeveloped at great expense by beef baron Larry Goodman.
Over the past year or so, since the government signed the lease to be the anchor tenant on Miesian Plaza, unions representing staff have raised a series of concerns about moving to the building. With one cacophonous voice, the unions have queried everything: the location, the building itself and the layout. Which might be somewhat understandable, but for the fact that the current department is located at Hawkins House, a building that is in a very visible state of disrepair. The drab brick-and-glass tower is an utter eyesore in the city centre. Scaffolding surrounds its entrance and has done for some time. Hawkins House and the buildings around it have been earmarked for demolition. Few people in the city are likely to shed a tear over their demise.
Miesian Plaza has been upgraded to become one of the finest modern offices in the city. The 20 minutes – or less – it takes to walk from Hawkins House to Baggot Street will cause disruption to some people’s travel and childcare plans. Hawkins House sits beside a Dart station, has considerable car parking and is now on the Luas Cross City. But Baggot Street is by no definition an undesirable location.
An architects’ report commissioned by one of the public sector unions representing staff has raised multiple concerns about the move. Hawkins House, the report found, is 54 per cent bigger than Miesian Plaza, where far fewer parking spaces are available. And there will be far less private space inside the building for staff. Some employees would even have to sit at clusters of up to eight desks. “A cluster of more than four workstations cannot be deemed as providing a satisfactory working environment. The potential for distraction and interruption of concentration in six and eight-person clusters cannot be overestimated,” stated the report, seen by this newspaper.
It was suggested by one trade union official that public sector staff would be working in call centre-like conditions.
There would also be a lack of offices for those at senior level. In addition to staff working in open-plan offices, there would be lack of privacy. And, as we revealed in this newspaper last week, one trade union official even went so far as to suggest that their personal items would not be safe, although the unions were later assured that security should not be a greater issue in the new location than it was at Hawkins House.
Perhaps, though, it suggests something more about the reluctance of some in the civil service and the unions that represent them to embrace change and reform.
Many government departments and locations are warrens of small private offices. If you speak to any management guru, they will tell you that open-plan environments lead to greater collaboration and engagement among employees as well as better decision- making. Even in a hierarchy like the civil service, that should be a welcome outcome.
Reforming the culture of Ireland’s public sector has not been easy. A decade ago, the OECD, the Paris-based intergovernmental organisation, was drafted in by then taoiseach Bertie Ahern to carry out the first review of the role of the Irish public service and outline how it could be improved.
Addressing a room packed with senior public sector officials in Dublin Castle, Ahern said: “Gone are the days of smoky, cheerless buildings. Gone are the days when thick panes of glass stood between citizens and nameless officials in public offices such as tax or social welfare. Gone are the days when the idea of being treated as a customer just didn’t exist.”
The OECD report, which runs to several hundred pages, is an interesting read. Between 1995 and 2007 (when it was commissioned), there was a large expansion in the numbers working in the public sector, but this only brought Ireland into line with other European nations.
There was, however, also plenty of scope for improvement. As Ahern noted, a major change was needed in order to put the end user at the centre of everything the public sector did. That alone would require a major shift in attitude. The financial crisis hit before many of the reforms could be enacted.
In 2011, the Fine Gael/Labour coalition returned to the idea of reform and again attempted to bring delivery and customer service to the fore. As the country was in the middle of years of austerity and budget deficits, this was as much about maximising value for money as it was reform. But the then minister for public expenditure and reform, Brendan Howlin, had developed plans for a major overhaul of the delivery of services.
In one narrative of the collapse of the Irish economy, the public sector has been on the receiving end of the worst of austerity. There have been huge pay cuts for staff across the board. There is also the levy on their pensions. There are much fewer people around to do even more work as a results of the exodus of staff through redundancy. They are on the frontline of fire from the public as a result of policy failure.
If you speak to any politician or minister, they will tell you of the great efforts of those working in Ireland’s public sector and their dedication. What they say is true in many, if not most, cases. But most will not dare criticise the sector over the fact that implementing reform can be a sheer nightmare or the resistance of some to change.
The OECD report (and Howlin’s plans from his time as minister for public expenditure and reform) show what a modern, outward-facing public sector should look like and how it interacts with citizens. But reform categorically does not look like the monolithic and outdated Hawkins House.

Keane still battling to keep Sandymount hotel

Highlight: Goldman Sachs fund piles on legal pressure
Body


In the past three weeks, under relentless pressure from a Goldman Sachs vulture fund, mother of two and bed-and-breakfast owner Ann Keane has been pushed a step closer to homelessness.
Earlier this month, a Court of Appeal ruling ended Keane’s protracted legal battle to stave off repossession of Aberdeen Lodge in Sandymount, Dublin a boutique Edwardian hotel on leafy Park Avenue, that doubles as her family home.
While the keys have not yet been handed over, she says valuers and agents of the banking giant have been calling round to measure up the property, with an eye to redevelopment.
On June 6, the court will consider whether to lift a stay on the repossession order, potentially marking the end of the road for Keane, her partner Pat Halpin and their two young children.
“It’s my livelihood. It’s my home. I don’t have anything else,” she said.
Keane and Halpin bought the Edwardian property for €1.2 million in 1998, with a loan from Irish Nationwide.
But guarantees on unpaid boomtime business debts of €26 million put Aberdeen Lodge in the firing line. Goldman vehicle Kenmare bought up the company loans and has been pursuing this one remaining asset since 2014.
The mortgage on the property is €980,000. Keane is chipping away at it month by month, and has offered to pay up to €1.45 million to settle the debts.
She believes this would represent a good return for Goldman, which would have bought the loans at a knockdown price.
“I don’t want a free ride. I want to be able to buy the business and pay the loan and continue on,” she said.
A recent valuation of the property came out at €2 million. The bank believes it may be worth considerably more.
Keane last spoke to The Sunday Business Post in January of this year. She says on the back of that interview, the fund’s agents have engaged in without-prejudice negotiations.
So far there has been no deal and in tandem with the talks, Goldman has moved to bankrupt Halpin who is in his late sixties. It is a move she cannot understand.
In the meantime, Keane is living day to day, keeping her business going, none the wiser as to her family’s future.
“I’m kept busy with work and the children and all of that, but you wake up at four in the morning and think: ‘Jesus, where am I?’ You’re always wondering what’s going to happen.”

Recipients of this year’s Clinch Wealth Management Irish Law Awards were recognised for work that went beyond the call of duty. That’s according to Dr Eamonn G Hall, solicitor, notary public, author, academic and chairman of the judging panel.
Hall, principal of EG Hall & Co and former chief solicitor with Eircom, said the awards celebrated the achievements of current great lawyers in the knowledge that “without law, civilisation dies”.
“The awards are significant because they recognise ability, effort and the striving towards excellence,” he said.
The awards ceremony, which took place at the Clayton Hotel on Dublin’s Burlington Road on May 11, was the culmination of the diligent work of a 15-strong judging panel consisting of leading and notable professionals from across the legal sector, guided by Hall. The awards, which set out to identify, commend and honour excellence and achievement in Irish law, are now in their seventh year.
The panel had the difficult task of selecting winners from over 90 Irish law firms, legal practitioners and in-house legal teams across a number of categories that ranged from litigation, property, probate and planning to employment law. New regional categories were also added.
One of the judges, Bart Daly, managing director of Frontier Legal Research Ltd, said the work undertaken by Ireland’s legal profession goes beyond the obvious and often only discussed areas of litigation.
“Apart from litigation, which the media can pick up on, much work done by law firms goes unnoticed by the public,” said Daly, who has been involved in law publishing since 1981. “These awards give the opportunity to law firms to display and get credit for outstanding work.”
The judging panel boasted an impressive association of legal minds that included: Arran Dowling-Hussey, barrister, arbitrator, adjudicator and mediator, who works from the Law Library in Dublin and 33 Bedford Row Chambers in London; and Kevin O’Higgins, past president of the Law Society (2014/15) and a past president of the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association, (DSBA).
O’Higgins said the law awards allowed for some well-deserved recognition of Ireland’s industrious legal profession.
“The Irish Law Awards event is the All-Ireland for lawyers,” he said. “[It is] a wonderful occasion for legal firms, big and small, throughout Ireland, to meet in convivial surroundings and showcase their excellence.”
Other judges included: Eamonn Kennedy, director of legal affairs in RTÉ; Fidelma McManus, a partner in Beauchamps Commercial Property team; Henry Murdoch, a barrister and writer; Ann Neary, the solicitor and management consultant who founded the Institute for Research and Legal Standards; and Aoife Hennessy, the lead solicitor in the Commercial Litigation and Employment Law teams of Sweeney McGann, one of the leading legal practices in the mid-west region.
Charlie Flanagan, Minister for Justice and Equality, who opened this year’s event, paid tribute to the panel of judges on the night for their part in achieving excellence in the awards.
“The awards have become an established annual event and a recognised standard-bearer for the legal professions, thanks to those of you who supported it as sponsors, judges and participants.”
Also joining this year’s judging panel were Richard Hammond, a partner at Hammond Good, a firm in Mallow, Cork, and Rosemarie Loftus, a joint managing partner at Bourke, Carrigg & Loftus in Ballina, Mayo. Robert Heron, general counsel at Dunnes Stores, Michael V O’Mahony, solicitor and notary public, former partner in McCann FitzGerald and past president of the Law Society (1993/94), also placed on the panel, alongside Michele O’Boyle, a partner in O’Boyle Solicitors in Sligo, and Keith Walsh, a former president of the DSBA and principal of a four-person practice in Crumlin Village, in Dublin 12.
Loftus said the awards were about “a recognition of service of quality to state, public and the betterment of good to society”. She added it was “a privilege” to recognise the lifetime achievements of Chief Justice Susan Denham, “an icon of our legal world”.

Leitrim writer takes Post short story prize
Sunday Business Post

Length: 438 words
Byline: Elaine Prendeville
Highlight: Stiff competition as over 700 submissions received
Body


The winner of The Sunday Business Post/ Penguin Ireland Short Story Competition 2018 is P Kearney Byrne, for her story Nahari Liske.
Kearney Byrne was announced winner at a ceremony held last Tuesday at 9 Below on St Stephen’s Green. The Leitrim-based writer wins a €2,000 prize.
She said: “Every story comes in two halves. The first half takes place when someone writes the story. But the process isn’t complete until someone else reads it.
“Could there be any emerging writer who doesn’t dream of being published in a national Sunday newspaper? That The Sunday Business Post/ Penguin Ireland prize provides this opportunity to three lucky writers every year can only be applauded by writers everywhere.”
Nahari Liske was selected from over 700 submissions. Brendan Barrington of Penguin Ireland said: “Nahari Liske is something genuinely strange, and genuinely original. It is told in a language that exists at a slight angle to any familiar version of English, and it has a stark formal beauty – but at the same time it carries a deep emotional charge.”
Kearney Byrne holds an MA in creative writing from UCD. Previous recognition includes the John McGahern Award (2016), an Irish Arts Council Emerging Writer Award (2017), and a finalist position in the 2015 Hamlin Garland Award (Beloit Fiction Journal, USA). Her work has been published in several international journals. Kearney Byrne also works as a psychotherapist.
Second place, and a €500 prize, was awarded to Dublin writer Colm McDermott for his psychological mystery story White Noise. McDermott said: “Last year’s winning story really grabbed my attention, and I remember thinking this award was one I should keep an eye out for. The quality of the writing was amazing.
“Coming second is a massive deal for me; it gives me confidence that I’m still on the right track. I’m currently working on a novel, and I’m hoping this award will open doors for me.”
Michelle Coyne, a Galway-based writer and educator took third place, and €250, for her entry The Knot, described as “a story about the body, and the mind and the relationship between the two”.
Siobhán Lennon, chief executive of The Sunday Business Post, said: “I am pleased to see this award go from strength to strength. It is a testament to the power of the printed word, and proof positive that The Sunday Business Post readership is a creative force to be reckoned with.”
Elaine Prendeville, Sunday Business Post Magazine editor, said: “The judging panel noted an unprecedented response to this year’s competition, and a particularly high calibre of writing. The short story form is alive and well in this country.”

Liberalism has won in a mature, functioning democracy

Length: 1104 words
Byline: Colin Murphy
Highlight: The pro-life movement has strengths that liberal Ireland would do well to respect, but its high communal standards are harsh on individuals 
Body


Liberalism has won. Yesterday’s victory is the latest in a series of victories (on contraception, homosexuality, divorce, children’s rights, gender recognition, marriage) that, together, amount to a slow-burning revolution. (The battle on the secularisation of education is, admittedly, ongoing, but liberalism is in the ascendant.)
Some swagger would be understandable: this victory was hard won. But along the way damage was done. Traumatised by the setbacks of the 1980s and by the indignities of its own oppressed youth, liberal Ireland grew blind to the virtues of its opponents and deaf to their arguments. The result is a creed that, at times, replicates some of the characteristics of that which it replaced: arrogance; condescension; intolerance.
The pro-life campaign has been one of the great civic movements of the modern era. A minority faction within Irish Catholicism succeeded in bringing its cause mainstream. It correctly identified the threat from the liberalising of abortion laws abroad and made a pre-emptive strike against such encroachment here.
The group won a brilliantly opportunistic political victory in 1982 by securing election commitments from both Charles Haughey and Garret FitzGerald to hold a referendum, and then won that referendum against the advocacy of the then-taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, and his attorney general, Peter Sutherland.
They then kept the issue alive for 35 years, making strategic concessions or retreats when under pressure (first, on the right to travel and information; later, and with misgivings, on the threat to the life of the mother), but succeeding in defending their core position.
They lobbied assiduously, wielding disproportionate influence in the Oireachtas, despite declining influence in the media. They combined strategic nous with civic commitment to devastating political effect, making the issue practically untouchable for most of that time.
They may have been wrong on the law - the Eighth Amendment was crudely wrought - but they were right on social trends: the Eighth succeeded in its principal purpose, as a bulwark against the encroachment from abroad of liberalising abortion trends.
This is a political assessment, not a moral one. I disagree with them on the core issue. But in values, too, the pro-life movement has strengths that liberal Ireland would do well to respect.
In an age when opinion seems to herd to a kind of social common denominator, the pro-lifers are willing to stand against the crowd. This takes courage and independence of mind.
In doing so, they are prepared to be awkward. Maurice McCabe was awkward; Marie Collins was awkward; Morgan Kelly was awkward. Most of us want to get on with our lives and be left in peace, but a healthy democracy needs people who are prepared not just to stand against the crowd but to rail against them, and shout out.
The pro-lifers have great clarity of principle, and the commitment to follow through on it. I lack such clarity. I think most principles are muddy. I don’t envy them their clarity, but I respect it.
I think the pro-lifers are wrong on the sanctity of life from conception, and wrong that the protection of that life should trump the autonomy of women over their bodies.
But I recognise that my view is the easier one to hold today. Mine is the view that imposes less on my neighbours and demands less of our laws.
The pro-life position is an austere one in an age of permissiveness, an absolutist one in an age of relativism. It seeks to impose a high communal standard in an age when standards are largely held to be individual.
High communal standards are harsh on individuals. The pro-lifers will never satisfy liberals on the “hard cases” because the essence of the pro-life argument is that the greater good (of more lives saved) necessarily trumps hard cases.
This is a value judgment. It is not inherently uncompassionate or cruel, any more than any other public policy in which the greater good (as they see it) is served by a measure that may be unfair on individuals.
Running through the liberal movement is an intellectual intolerance that is unwilling to accept the pro-lifers as honest adversaries. Rather than debate their ideas, it seeks to delegitimise them as opponents.
Thus, pro-lifers are “cruel” or “uncompassionate” for not supporting the hard cases; or are “hypocrites” for seeking to ban women travelling for abortions, or to ban the morning-after pill; or are “disgusting” for pointing out abortion trends in Britain, such as those related to Down syndrome; or “don’t care about children” because they are a single-issue movement focused on unborn children.
This, broadly, was the strategy many liberals deployed against Trump and against the Brexiteers, declaring their concerns about immigration to be “racist” and therefore not worth debating. That the liberals won this time doesn’t mean that the tactics are sound. A robust liberalism needs to be able to argue on the merits, and to tolerate dissent, not shout it down.
This was a campaign in which both sides avoided the hard questions, fudged issues, drew help from abroad, had foot soldiers trolling online, and called the other side liars. For all that, there can hardly have been a person in the country who was not aware of the fundamental issue at stake, and the fundamental difference between the sides.
For if there were flaws in the campaign, there were great strengths in the process that led to it. The issues were well aired at the innovative Citizens’ Assembly and then at the Oireachtas committee, and the result was one which is rare in politics: people changed their minds.
The government could have run the referendum purely on the issue of the Eighth, kicking to touch on the legislation that would follow. Instead, it brought forward the general scheme of their intended bill: this was honest, but risky.
The two main parties allowed a free vote. Micheál Martin, in particular, took a risk and showed leadership. So, too, did Mary Lou McDonald. Meanwhile, Peadar Tóibín and other Sinn Féin members showed courage in standing against their party line.
This is what a mature, functioning democracy looks like. That gives yesterday’s result even greater authority.
If the pro-life movement is now an under-appreciated force in Irish public life, the pro-choice movement was long in that position. They fought the long, hard fight against majority opinion and powerful institutions. They did so with selflessness, tenacity and courage.
The greatest courage was shown by those women who, silenced for so long, emerged to tell their personal stories. They were the key factor. This is their day.

Louise O'Neill: ‘I’m interested in emotional honesty'
Sunday Business Post
May 26, 2018


Copyright 2018 Post Publications Ltd. All Rights Reserved

 
Length: 1446 words
Byline: Nadine O’Regan
Highlight: Louise O’Neill’s workrate is spectacular. The Cork-born  author has just published two new novels, and a theatrical adaptation of Asking For It, the book that made her name, is on the way. Nadine O’Regan asks her how she does it 
Body


Fact: Louise O’Neill makes every other Irish author look lazy.
As she breezes into a Dublin hotel, looking beautiful in a green silk outfit (“Asos White!” she says, downplaying it), O’Neill is here to touch another base in her game of media rounders. Other people write a novel every few years and then promote it. O’Neill has two new books out - The Surface Breaks and Almost Love - and a stage production of her novel Asking For It is about to premiere at the Everyman Theatre in Cork.
In recent weeks, O’Neill has been interviewed by seemingly every Irish media outlet going, from The Late Late Show through to the Southern Star, her local paper in her hometown of Clonakilty in west Cork, where she lives with her parents. She’s also got her regular column in the Irish Examiner to think about; then there’s her whirlwind social media presence: she’s an active figure on Instagram and Twitter, where she has over 30,000 followers.
I’ve read both of O’Neill’s new books, as well as her back catalogue (the novels Asking For It and Only Ever Yours), and frankly, I’m exhausted just keeping up with her. But if O’Neill herself is feeling any whiff of strain, she doesn’t show it today.
Although she gets a lot of stick online - mainly from those offended by her feminism - in person, O’Neill, 33, is a smart, likeable and thoughtful presence. She understands perfectly how unusual her three-pronged attack on the media is. It wasn’t what she planned.
“I know, I know,” she laughs, as she seeks to explain the complicated dance of publishers and adaptations. “I had started writing Almost Love when the publisher Scholastic approached me and asked if I’d be interested in doing a feminist retelling of The Little Mermaid. They had told me they were thinking of publishing in late May, and then [the publisher] Riverrun were thinking early March for Almost Love. But I couldn’t say no. I did children’s literature as part of my degree at Trinity, and I looked at how problematic a lot of fairytales are. With The Little Mermaid, she literally silences herself and mutilates her body in order to make a man love her.”
With The Surface Breaks, O’Neill has delivered a powerful treatise on feminism and the repressiveness of patriarchal culture, tucked neatly into a story that is immensely satisfying: the tale of a mermaid who wanted to leave behind her domineering father and find her loved one - a man she has dragged to safety after a shipwreck. If the book, which is geared towards young adults, has a unifying theme, it’s that you must learn to be true to yourself.
“I feel I’m writing the books that I needed to read when I was in my late teens, around gender, around the body, around power,” O’Neill says. “But I’m also an instinctive writer. When I sit down, I’m interested in getting at emotional honesty. I want to pare away the noise and make it as raw and honest and truthful as I can.”
O’Neill relates well to a young audience, perhaps in part because she faced challenges early on in life. At 14, after the death of a family member, O’Neill stopped eating properly. She would starve herself or vomit up food she had eaten. A perfectionist by nature, O’Neill used food as a point of focus - a tool through which she would process difficult emotions. She was academic and a high-achiever, with strong family support, but her struggles continued when she moved to Dublin to study English and History in Trinity in 2003.
“I was miserable,” O’Neill says. “It was that outsider element - I felt like I should have come up to Dublin and had a group of best friends immediately.” Eventually, O’Neill was hospitalised for her eating disorder. In the end, she took an extra year to complete her degree, graduating in 2008 and moving to New York for a period.
Those problems are in the past now, she says, largely because she has learned better techniques for taking care of herself. She has a therapist and a nutritionist. She goes to the gym. She eats sensibly, rarely drinks, and she’s learning how to deal with the sometimes hazardous process of doing interviews and having people ask her personal questions. She might read a review or interview; she might not. She is even more careful in relation to social media, having experienced its highs and lows after Asking For It - her razor-sharp novel about sexual abuse as experienced by her young lead character Emma - was published in late 2015.
“I know I have to protect myself,” O’Neill says. “I don’t search for my own name on Twitter. I don’t read the comments on Boards.ie. It’s self-care. After Asking For It came out, I felt very stressed. There was a lot of online abuse, and I have to hold my hand up, because I was interacting with it. I was trying to have nuanced conversations with trolls and there was no point. It took a massive toll on my health. Now I just mute them.”
If truth be told, O’Neill appears to have no greater critic than her own inner voice, pecking away at her, and holding up a stained mirror as a true reflection. She is restlessly ambitious and endlessly perfectionist, constantly seeking to improve herself. “I’m impatient,” she says. “I want things to go faster.”
At the tail-end of 2016, O’Neill recalls how she sat at home by the fire on New Year’s Eve and decided to make a list of her achievements over the past 12 months. She dashed off pages of professional achievements and then looked over at the heading marked ‘personal achievements’ and saw she had almost nothing written down. “I thought, ‘I can’t keep doing this’,” she says. Where most people might have seen a successful year in the rearview mirror, O’Neill went straight to the absences; the hopes and the dreams.
Some weeks after this interview, I meet O’Neill again - and, as has been made clear by her Instagram feed in the meantime, she is happily in a new relationship. Still, it’s a tricky business, dating writers, as O’Neill attests. “I don’t want to speak for all creative people, but for me there’s a certain selfishness around the way that I create. I dislike being distracted. I am a very immersive writer. When I write, it’s like a method acting.” She laughs. “That might not make me the easiest person to live with.”
In O’Neill’s other new book Almost Love, she explores the consequences of difficult love. Her lead character Sarah is a 27-year-old teacher and artist who has fallen for Matthew, a dislikeable older figure who is using Sarah without her realising it. Sarah is a tricky character herself, mind you: selfish, insecure and incapable of seeing the good that exists in her privileged south Dublin life. The narrative is spiky, full of prickliness and self-loathing, and shot through with thought-provoking lines about young relationships. Put it this way, it’s no Jeffrey Archer airport read.
“It might be less taxing for me to write a book dealing with lighter issues, but that’s not what I’m interested in,” O’Neill says. “Almost Love is not a charming, easy read, but there is an appetite for this kind of book. I think this book is commercial because I think it will sell.”
In truth, that may be less to do with the storyline than with the charms and persuasions of O’Neill herself. No writer that I can think of, in modern-day Ireland, has done as much to bring her work to the Irish public.
Where other authors retreat into the shadows, O’Neill insists on being seen. In that insistence, she is doing a favour not simply to her publishers - who will always want their books in the spotlight - but also to the feminist causes she endorses. Through her life and her writing, O’Neill demands a constant interrogation of the way in which women and men treat one another.
This will be particularly the case next month, when the debut production of Asking For It will be brought to life on the stage, premiering in the Everyman Theatre in Cork, before moving to the Abbey Theatre in the autumn. “I’m so excited about it,” O’Neill says. “And I’m delighted it’s premiering in Cork. Because I’m from Cork, and the book is set in Cork, that means a lot to me.”
There will be more to come soon from O’Neill. She’s considering writing a memoir, and there are screen adaptations of her books Only Ever Yours and Asking For It on the way. It’s a crazy, discombobulating schedule, but it appears to suit her.
Where once she felt like an outsider, now O’Neill feels comfortable wherever she goes. “I’ve come to the point where I believe I am anyone’s equal,” she says. “In any room, I feel completely equal.” She pauses for a moment, and laughs. “Unless, of course, Beyoncé is in there.”
The Surface Breaks and Almost Love by Louise O’Neill are available now. Asking For It will premiere at the Everyman Theatre in Cork on June 15

Moore Street property will pique investors’ interest

Body


Private investors have been presented with an interesting opportunity following the news that 62 Moore Street has been placed on the market.
Colliers International is handling the sale of the three-storey, over-basement property. Just 30 yards from Henry Street, it enjoys an ideal retail location.
The area is renowned for its age-old fruit and veg market and historic buildings which were linked to the 1916 Rising. The area will be further enhanced by the future redevelopment of the Dublin Central site, which is bounded by Moore Street, Henry Street, O’Connell Street and Parnell Street, now owned by Hammerson.
The building adjoins number five Henry Street, occupied by Wallis, which was bought last year by AEW. Other surrounding occupiers include Paddy Power, Eurogiant and international brands on Henry Street to include JD Sports, Boots, Pull & Bear and Arnotts, owned by Selfridges Group which has recently announced plans of an €11 million upgrade.
The sale presents an opportunity to acquire an investment property let to FX Buckley on a 35-year lease from November 1, 1989 at €35,000 per annum, with 6.5 years unexpired and an upward-only rent review set for 2019.
Number 62 comprises 102 square metres with a ground floor retail area of 34 square metres.
Mandy Daly of Colliers International said: “The opportunity will appeal to surrounding occupiers and private investors looking to invest in a prime city centre retail location, a stone’s throw from Henry Street.”
Colliers International is guiding €650,000, which equates to a net initial yield of 4.96 per cent after allowing for standard purchasers costs of 8.46 per cent.

Highlight: Hamburg’s new measure at first looks drastic and a shot across the bow of diesel power, but in fact it’s nothing of the sort
Body


On Thursday, May 31, a new diesel ban comes into force in Hamburg, Germany’s second largest city. On reading that line alone, there’s no doubt that motorists here in Ireland will continue to worry about the future of diesel power and whether they should be rapidly making a switch. And therein lies the issue with the current focus on pollution caused by diesel vehicles. This new ban is actually restricted to two specific areas of Hamburg: a 1.6-kilometre stretch of road for commercial vehicles and another 580-metre-long area for all diesel vehicles. Also, it’s not an outright ban on diesel, but a ban on diesel vehicles that don’t conform to the Euro 6 legislation introduced in 2014. So, in summary, that’s a ban on most diesel vehicles from before 2014 on two small stretches of the city’s roads.
Hopefully the details get conveyed to the public and understood outside Germany, where this measure is likely to be construed as a political manoeuvre designed to get the government to force car makers to retrofit older diesel models with exhaust aftertreatment updates to bring them in line with far cleaner post-Euro 6 vehicles. Note, the intention is not to ban diesel outright.
Over here in Ireland, however, the government seems to be focused solely on its so-called Project Ireland 2040, with proposals to prevent the sale of non-zero emissions vehicles after 2030, and then the gradual banning of existing non-zero emissions vehicles from the road by 2045. I’m all for a zero emissions future, but I really worry about such grandiose statements, how they will affect the car industry and the average motorist and how the timelines have been decided upon. Within that plan, the government aims to have 500,000 electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030. There are currently about 4,000. So, that’s an average of over 40,000 new EVs per year to be sold between now and then.
That seems utterly preposterous given the incredibly slow take-up of EVs in Ireland, even allowing for the likely significant increase toward the end of that decade (I don’t see a big change until EV technology matures well into the 2020s). And anyway, the 500,000-vehicle target is an arbitrary one.
Additionally, the proposed €200 million set aside for the charging infrastructure seems completely inadequate, especially when the network seems ill-equipped to cope with the few EVs there are on the road right now. Some will argue that the next-generation EVs will have much longer ranges between charge-ups, which is likely to be true, but it still takes a given amount of energy to power a car for a given length of time and speed and that energy has to get into the car’s battery somehow.
So, while I love the idea of a future where the air is clean for our children and grandchildren, I also think we need to be realistic about how we get there. Hamburg’s measure at first looks drastic and a shot across the bow of diesel power, but in fact it’s nothing of the sort, instead a step towards a cleaner automotive future, one that probably includes diesel for some time to come. We should focus on sustainable steps of improvement and reduction in pollution rather than on the fuel that delivers it, and convey a full and realistic timeframe for these changes to the population as soon as possible. I wish our government would.
While I don’t specialise in commercial vehicles, I’ve driven my fair share of pickup trucks, but none has garnered the attention that the new Mercedes-Benz X-Class did in my time with it recently on Irish roads for the first time. Perhaps it’s to do with the fact that the X-Class is the company’s first-ever pickup, but I suspect part of the attention was down to the sheer presence the X-Class has, especially painted white and fitted with a set of attractive alloy wheels. And all that hints at where Mercedes sees the X-Class fitting into the automotive landscape, as it reckons there’s an increase in pickup buyers choosing a commercial vehicle as an alternative to a traditional SUV – and that it’s as much about the image as it is the utility of the vehicle. The X-Class, for what it’s worth, shares its underpinnings with the Nissan Navara, though the body and interior are all-new and, for the most part, worthy of the Mercedes star. The cabin looks good (though feels more ‘robust’ in places rather than luxurious) and can easily carry five adults. On the road without a heavy load in the back, the suspension can be a little choppy, but that’s no different to most other vehicles.

Highlight: This country has a sad history of men killing women and hiding their bodies. Yet the tragic death of Jastine Valdez has still shocked Ireland to its core
Body


On Saturday afternoon last weekend, Jastine Valdez went to the gym in Carrickmines. The 24-year-old then travelled to Bray by bus to meet a friend. She bought a loaf of bread in SuperValu. All normal, routine things for a young woman who, just three years ago, had come to Ireland to make it her home.
Jastine was the only child of Teresita and Danillo Valdez. Her parents had moved to Ireland many years ago, and in 2015 Jastine left the Philippines, where she was living with her grandmother, to live with them in Enniskerry, Co Wicklow..
Jastine loved Ireland, and had recently spoken of plans to buy her own home here. She had a job in a restaurant, and was a part-time accountancy student at the Institute of Technology in Tallaght. She normally travelled by bus, and was a familiar sight getting on and off the number 185 bus in Enniskerry. At 5.47pm last Saturday evening, Jastine got on the 185 in Bray, heading for her home.
As she was on that bus, Mark Hennessy was just a few kilometres away, driving his Nissan Qashqai jeep towards Enniskerry. He left a pub in Ballybrack, south Dublin at 5.42pm, CCTV capturing him speaking on his mobile phone as he walked towards his car. He had bought the 171 Dublin-registered jeep last year. Video footage taken on the day of the purchase, and which has since emerged, shows him telling the camera he is “delighted with my buy”. Watching the video now is chilling. This is the vehicle that he used to abduct Jastine, and it is the vehicle in which he would eventually be fatally shot by a garda.
Mark Hennessy was 40 years old, and he lived with his partner and two young children in Bray. He worked as a builder. Originally from Ballybrack, he was due to face a charge of drink-driving. He had an historic conviction for a minor drug possession from the 1990s, and also a conviction for abusive behaviour in a public place.
[caption id="attachment_417478" align="alignleft" width="445"] Jastine Valdez: planned to build a life in Ireland[/caption]
Garda investigations have now established that Hennessy was actively looking to buy drugs on the day he abducted and murdered Jastine. Although he was in a pub that afternoon, and returned to it after murdering Jastine, he was not drinking heavily that day. He may have had one or two drinks, but seemed more concerned with getting drugs.
The first half of the English FA Cup final between Chelsea and Manchester United was being shown on television in the pub as Hennessy left at 5.42pm. Six kilometres further south, Jastine Valdez was heading for her bus back to Enniskerry. After a week of investigations, no link has been established between Jastine and her abductor. It seems that Jastine was randomly targeted and fell prey to Hennessy simply because she was in his line of sight at a particular time.
Jastine got off the 185 bus in Enniskerry and began walking up the Kilcroney Road towards the home she shared with her parents. She was carrying her blue shoulder bag containing her Apple iPad Mini. Her iPad went everywhere with her. She kept in contact with her parents regularly on Facebook. As she walked home, she was also carrying the loaf of bread she had bought earlier. She was just a few minutes from home, on a road she had walked along so many times.
A 12-year-old boy witnessed the abduction. It was around 6.20pm. The child saw a jeep parked up on the Kilcroney Road and a woman being bundled into the boot. It all happened in a matter of seconds, but the Qashqai jeep did not have an enclosed boot, so the boy was able to see Jastine in the vehicle.
At 6.24pm, the first 999 call was received: a woman was calling on the boy’s behalf, and gardaí were informed of exactly where the incident had occurred. The Garda helicopter was despatched to the area, and three patrol cars began enquiries. Nothing was found at the Kilcroney road except for a loaf of bread in a paper bag. It would later turn out that the bread was Jastine’s.
It is impossible to imagine what Jastine endured in those moments. We know she was shouting from inside the vehicle and was gesticulating. This information came from the second witness to contact the emergency services to describe what he had seen. This witness first spoke with his wife before contacting the authorities. He described seeing an Asian woman in the boot of a car who was in a distressed state.
This call was logged at 7.20pm. Crucially, this witness described the vehicle as a black Nissan SUV. Gardaí made enquiries locally, including at the nearby Powerscourt Hotel, to see if a woman matching the description was missing, and they began searching local premises for CCTV and tracked down the Dublin buses that had been in Enniskerry to get on-board footage.
With his captive in the boot of his car, Hennessy drove to Pucks Castle near Rathmichael, an isolated spot in south Dublin. He would have known the area from growing up in Ballybrack: it’s a scenic location, popular with walkers. One witness saw him driving erratically in the area in the early evening.
Hennessy then strangled Jastine to death. When her body was discovered last Monday, she was clothed, but her clothing had been disturbed. This may have been as a result of her body being dragged a distance and then hidden in dense gorse. A subsequent post-mortem examination determined that her death had possibly occurred about an hour after she was abducted.
At 11.20pm that Saturday night, Jastine’s parents walked into Bray Garda Station to report their daughter missing. Teresita and Danillo Valdez were very concerned. Their daughter had been expected home to Enniskerry and had not arrived. She would always keep in touch, but there was no sign of her. It was entirely out of character, they told gardaí.
[caption id="attachment_417479" align="alignright" width="463"] Mark Hennessy: appalling attack[/caption]
After murdering Jastine, Hennessy spent some time back in the pub in Ballybrack. He made a number of phone calls. He did not go home to Bray that night.
CCTV from Enniskerry led gardaí to identify Hennessy as the suspect in Jastine’s abduction. He had made no effort to disguise his licence plate, and it was spotted in the area of the village around the time of the attack. When detectives called to his home, his partner told them Hennessy had not come home the previous night.
At 8pm, he was fatally shot by a garda in Cherrywood business park. Gardaí were responding to a report that his car was there. A national appeal was, by then, being made for the 171D Qashqai believed to have been used in the abduction of Jastine. As gardaí approached the vehicle, they didn’t know if she was still in the jeep. A lot of blood was visible inside the vehicle. Hennessy was sitting inside, making swiping movements. A detective fired one shot, hitting him in the shoulder, but the bullet travelled into his torso and he died. It transpired the blood in the vehicle was his own, as a result of him slashing his own arms.
Intriguingly, and thankfully, Hennessy left a blood-stained note in the car, with the words ‘Pucks Castle’. The word ‘sorry’ was also on the note. The note led gardaí to the location where Jastine’s body was found after many hours spent searching vast terrain. Her shoulder bag and iPad Mini were missing.
The entire country is asking the same questions: what other crimes might Hennessy have committed, if any? What drives a man, in a relationship and who has young children, to commit such a random abduction and murder?
Criminologist Kevin Sweeney told me last week that Hennessy’s appalling attack seemed to be impulsive. “There was no foresight or planning in terms of getting false number plates for his vehicle, and the crime was committed in broad daylight in front of witnesses,” he said.
Forensic psychologist Dr Patrick Randall said there were a number of issues to consider, including the fact that Hennessy was seeking drugs. “The red mist had descended, so something happened to activate his primitive brain and shut down his higher functioning, so he acted in a very unpredictable way, and he just sought to meet his immediate needs,” said Randall.
Hennessy is the latest violent abductor to strike in Ireland. This country has a sad history of men murdering women and hiding their bodies. In 1976, two serial killers from England teamed up and murdered two women in Co Wicklow and Co Mayo. When they were arrested, John Shaw and Geoffrey Evans told detectives they had intended raping and murdering one woman every week.
In December 1979, John Crerar, a married man with children, abducted and murdered Phyllis Murphy. She was last seen waiting for a bus in Newbridge, Co Kildare. Her body was found hidden in the Wicklow Gap 28 days later. Crerar was only brought to justice in 2002 following advances in DNA technology.
One of the most infamous abductors is Larry Murphy, who was released from prison in 2010 after completing a prison sentence imposed for an attack he committed against one victim in three counties on one night. It was in February 2000 that he abducted a woman in Carlow. He initially subdued his victim by punching her in the face and breaking her nose. He forced her into his car, and then raped her in Co Kildare and again in Co Wicklow before trying to murder her. The woman fought back, and two hunters stumbled on the scene and saved the woman’s life. After his release from prison, Murphy first settled in Amsterdam but more recently has been living in London.
From my research, I believe there are at least ten cases of women who disappeared in Leinster in a ten-year period between 1988 in 1998, and were murdered and their bodies hidden. Most of those bodies have never been found, and none of the killers has ever been brought to justice. Those killers are either dead, in prison for other attacks - or still living among us.
While investigations continue into the background of Mark Hennessy and what else he may be responsible for, we should also remember there are other, similar violent men who have got away with their crimes. Attackers who planned their murderous crimes to a higher degree than Hennessy, any of whom could still strike again.

Musgrave Group aims to ‘go after every eating occasion’

Length: 916 words
Byline: Gillian Nelis
Highlight: Musgrave’s has built Frank and Honest Coffee into the country’s top selling brand, but chief executive Chris Martin is hungry for more 
Body


Chips and coffee may not be an obvious combination. But along with gluten-free bread, Irish gin, healthy salads and organic vegetables, they’ve helped the Musgrave Group grow its profits for the third year in a row.
Last week, the group – whose brands include SuperValu, Centra, Daybreak and Mace – reported pre-tax profits of €80 million for 2016, a 9 per cent increase on 2015.
That money has been generated from areas you’d expect, like the 60 to 70 per cent of products in our shopping baskets that are the same every week, but also from some you might not. And that is where the chips and coffee come in.
Over a cup of the latter in the massive Ballymun branch of Musgrave Marketplace, the group’s wholesale division, its chief executive Chris Martin tells me that building new brands has been a key focus over the past few years.
“During the recession, we put a lot of time and money into really understanding the consumer: what they wanted to eat, where and when they wanted to eat it, and how their needs might change in the future,” he said. “And then we set about building brands that met their needs.”
One of those brands, Frank and Honest coffee, which was rolled out two years ago, is available in 630 of the group’s stores, and is now the country’s best-selling coffee brand.
Chipmongers, its chain of fish and chip shops, is the same age. It has been a slower burn, with ten branches so far, but Martin and his team hope to grow it significantly this year. Moo’d, an ice cream concession, is in over 66 Centra and SuperValu stores, and Martin has his eye on the pizza and salad markets for more expansion.
The goal, according to Martin, is to “go after every eating occasion”, and future-proof the business against Brexit headwinds and a drastically changing retail environment.
“Things are changing in our business at a rapid rate and will continue to do so,” he said. “Eating patterns are changing – people want to buy and eat food in ways that suit them. Some of them order online and have their shopping delivered, some want to click and collect, and others want to order their lunchtime sandwich on an app and not have to queue up to get it.
“The great thing is that the more we looked at how things are changing, the more we became convinced that we could become exactly what the market would want: a technology-enabled retailer that’s providing a great food experience.”
Perhaps surprisingly, online shopping accounts for only 2 per cent of the Irish grocery market, compared to between 6 and 7 per cent in Britain. While Martin does expect that to increase, particularly in the cities, he believes that the in-store experience will continue to be hugely important.
“Even in Britain, where the market is much more extensive, you’re seeing a move away from home delivery to click and collect. Customers want and expect to have a great online relationship with retailers, but they also want to visit the store and find out what’s different,” he said.
“So I can absolutely see a situation where someone clicks and collects for the products they buy week in and week out, but who spends time in the store before they make that collection having a look at what’s new and exciting.”
Increasingly, those new and exciting products are healthy ones. Martin believes the demand for ‘free from’, organic and healthy food is only going to increase – “in many of our stores, the ‘free from’ area is the busiest area” – but at the same time, shoppers will still want locally-sourced treats like organic chocolate, artisan gin and high-quality baked goods.
To that end, Martin said work would continue on developing Food Academy, the group’s programme for small food producers, which marked its fifth year in operation last week and which is expected to generate €50 million in sales annually for those producers over the next five years.
Food Academy, Martin said, was a brand that had attracted interest from overseas. While Musgrave recently announced a €5 million deal to supply the Bahraini supermarket chain Alosra and there were more opportunities abroad for the group, he said that would be a slow burn.
Much closer to home are the group’s businesses in the North. In the event of a hard Brexit, would he consider pulling out?
“No. We won’t be doing that,” he said. “I’m cognisant that it could get messy, very messy even, but it will settle down. Our key job is ensuring that our customers don’t see any disruption, because they won’t forgive us if they do. But we’ve had some insight into what Brexit might look like with the exchange rate. We’ve had to dig deep to support our retailers because of it in the recent past.”
Those retailers – the group directly owns a small number of shops, but the vast majority are owned and run by franchisees – are generally in a good place, Martin said.
“I wouldn’t say it’s all rosy, because it isn’t. There are still challenges in terms of increasing business costs, and price deflation in the grocery sector isn’t going away any time soon.”
“But over the past nine months we have had over 100 store revamps. The fact that those businesses are now investing in their premises again after really tough years tells a lot. We are very lucky to have them. We don’t take anything for granted. We are 140 years old now, but we want to be here for the next 140, and they are the people who will help us do that.”

Now may be the time for Varadkar to take the leap

Highlight: The success of the referendum may encourage the Taoiseach to dissolve this dysfunctional government and seek a firmer mandate 
Body


Oscar Wilde said that he could “resist everything except temptation”. The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, will be sorely tempted this weekend to take the opportunity to put this government out of its misery and go to the country for a firmer mandate. To say that the government is frayed at the edges is to understate it. But the success of the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution is a landmark achievement.
Whatever younger citizens might believe, it took courage and resolve to press ahead to tackle the thorniest social issue in Irish politics for four decades. However, the coalition of interests that made it possible cannot be cemented for any economic purpose. It is in the economic realm that the country faces its biggest challenges and needs a government capable of dealing fairly but firmly with vested interests.
When the Kenny/Gilmore government took office in 2011, nobody forecast an economic recovery like we have seen. Nor did anybody forecast the madness that seized the British political establishment leading to the exit of Britain from the EU and the adverse impact of that for Ireland.
To be hit by such a second economic thunderbolt within the same decade is unusual. And Brexit is not the only storm cloud on the horizon that threatens our economic renewal. The Taoiseach may not get a better opportunity than this to test whether the Irish people are still minded to send a chaotic, fragmented class of politicians to Leinster House.
The legacy of the banking and financial crash is the unworkable fragmentation of politics that is configured in the present Dáil. Populists of the left and right are not interested in government. They run with the hare and hunt with the hound. They can hold government to ransom. They believe that they are elected only to protest. Their colourful stunts are attractive to the media. They waste parliamentary time and impede necessary government-sponsored legislation beyond the point of reasonable debate. The last thing needed by Irish democracy is greater focus on the parish pump.
New politics is not entirely without achievement. But the output is poor. It is right that anybody elected to Dáil Éireann has fair opportunity to represent his or her perception of their constituents’ needs. However, the Dáil is being reduced to a talking shop where legislative output plays second fiddle. Daft, unworkable and inconsistent measures are sometimes voted through at second stage where the substance of issues is agreed. Such measures are then reposed in a legislative limbo.
As they back up, what will the government do? Government can’t indefinitely ignore the wishes of parliament; however, neither can it proof the proposed legislation in committee because of its minority position.
Last week, the Ceann Comhairle had to call a halt to the interminable debate on the Judicial Appointments Bill because of “an unacceptable level of confusion”. TDs who themselves, unfortunately, are strangers to legislating are content to reduce the Dáil to a talking shop.
In order to stay in office, the government is forced to do a deal with Sinn Féin if a bill, earlier described by the Attorney General as “a dog’s dinner”, is to be enacted. Sections of bills enacted by the Oireachtas have been struck down by the Supreme Court in the past. But this has been rare and the sponsors acted in good faith. Now there is a danger that legislation advised to be contrary to the Constitution or otherwise internally inconsistent may find its way on to the statute books.
Separately, there may be political consequences for Fine Gael if the party’s ministers are seen to enter a deal with Sinn Féin to put through a piece of doubtful and unnecessary legislation on a matter as sensitive as the appointment of senior judges. And if that can happen on this occasion why would not Fianna Fáil cause it to happen again? It knows the message it sends out. Until recently, true blue Fine Gaelers would have considered an alliance with Sinn Féin as unthinkable as Stormy Daniels joining a convent.
All unfinished legislation falls with the collapse of the Dáil. Of course, arguments can be advanced for the continuation of the present rickety arrangement for another short while. But the chaotic dysfunction on display last week is only likely to be repeated. Brexit is not the only hurdle to be surmounted. The creation of a government in Italy by two warring populist groupings threatens to reopen eurozone wounds. The blatant drive towards autocratic rule in Hungary, with Poland not far behind, threatens the foundations of the EU. The campaign by the new French president on corporate taxes may have unavoidable consequences for Ireland.
A government needs to be able to tackle the other big issues now being avoided. It may be time to go.

Highlight: Someone out there probably has a get-rich-quick-scheme which will derail your five-year plan, which means your CV needs to be about rolling with the punches, not loyalty 
Body


Did you hear that Barack and Michelle Obama are going to work for Netflix? I know America is the land of opportunity and all, but I didn’t quite foresee that the next step from the White House for America’s smartest celebrity pairing would be House of Cards and its associated dramas. Still, it makes perfect sense, once you take a moment to think about it.
Obama doesn’t want to get involved in politics right now – reportedly out of a fear that he will be used as a target by Donald Trump – and the couple are planning to use the platform, in their multi-year deal, to develop series and documentaries that will focus on issues the president highlighted in his eight years in office. In fairness, who would turn down the former leader of the free world? You’d be practically paying Netflix to let you have lunch with them. Doors will open. Good programmes will get made.
The move makes sense for the Obamas in another way, too. It’s an effective way of drawing a line under what they did before, and sharply redefining themselves, rewriting the descriptors in their CVs with a new and exciting chapter. In that respect, the Obamas are like any other modern couple. They had two particular jobs; now they’ve got two new ones. They’re starting all over again, reinventing themselves – and it’s not easy.
In that respect, I can’t help but think that the Obamas are rather more like the rest of us than we might imagine. Although most of us will never become president of anything other than our own lunch hours, these days, we are all having to get used to the idea of pursuing several careers in one lifetime. Long gone are the days when we would hit retirement, receive the gold watch or pen, and celebrate our five decades in the one position.
Civil service types aside, we change careers at speed, swinging between trees like Tarzan in a business suit. Sometimes we’re the marketeer; other times we’re the start-up executive; or the stockbroker. Just look at Theresa Lowe: one minute she’s presenting Where In The World? on RTÉ television; the next she’s a solicitor; the next she’s turning up on TV3 as a pro-life enthusiast. Frankly, the audience’s heads were spinning trying to keep her career platforms straight. (I can’t have been the only one googling Lowe’s name to try to figure out how on earth she got from A to Z.) These days, if you get asked in a job interview where you see yourself in five years, the most truthful answer may be to say: “In another career, your honour.”
That’s the deal these days even if you like your career and you’d really rather hang onto it. For new entrants into the jobs market, they’re facing into a gig economy where jobs for life have been replaced by zero-hour positions and tricky-dicky contracts with more get-out clauses than Trump has bad hair days. For seasoned employees, technology is often to blame for their job redundancies.
I mean, I’m not about about to fall on my knees and cry out, ‘The robots are taking our jobs’, but honestly, they probably are. A good example of that is the secretary role, which has been effectively phased out in recent generations. You don’t need someone to take your dictation, when you can sit down and write an email yourself. No matter what role you’re in, technology may supplant at least part of you do, making it time for a career rethink and a good, hard look at yourself.
The trick is to make all these transitions look easy and effortless, when, frankly, they can be anything but. In her excellent new book, The Art of Not Falling Apart, Christina Patterson suggests that we simply have to get used to the shocks, and start not just rolling with the punches, but expecting them.
When she was made redundant from her position as a journalist with the London Independent, her employer sat her down and bluntly asked: “What is so special about you?” Patterson was appalled by his callousness. But it also set her thinking. For her new book, she asked several industry leaders how they coped after they moved or lost their positions. Some bounced back easily. Others struggled. But they all learnt a lot about themselves, as did Patterson. By the book’s conclusion, she is happy again, and she’s learned to ground her self-esteem not in a job description, but in her own understanding of herself and her innate capabilities.
All of which brings us back to Barack and Michelle. We may never get to hear how the Obamas coped after handing over the presidency. But their Netflix move is a salutary lesson in how to reinvent yourself in style, while making the transition look entirely effortless. Roll with those punches – and make hay while the sun shines. And hey, if Netflix comes calling, just say yes.

Plans lodged for €125m office block on Cork city quays

Body


The commercial development and regeneration of Cork city centre and docklands marches on, with plans for the latest office block for the city quays lodged last week, valued at €125 million.
Fresh from delivering a series of high-end projects, including One Albert Quay, The Capitol and refurbishing 97 South Mall, Mahon-based JCD Group has just lodged plans for a new 23,225 square metre development of cutting-edge office blocks spread over 1.8 acres at Penrose Quay in the heart of Cork’s docklands.
Cork competes at a global level for Foreign Direct Investment and is home to a number of household name firms’ headquarter offices and a host of pharma and tech and financial multinationals. They include Apple’s European headquarters, Siemens, Amazon’s customer services, GlaxoSmithKlein, Johnson & Johnson and data company EMC.
This latest commercial project, Penrose Dock, is designed to face south on the river Lee. It will accommodate and retain in full the historic 1,115 square metre Penrose House as well as comprising two new large individual office buildings.
One Penrose Dock will have a net lettable area of 7,245 square metres. Two Penrose Dock will be located on the north of the site next to the new pedestrian entrance to Kent Station and will have a net lettable area of 14,865 square metres.
A key feature of the buildings’ design will be large column-less floor plates, which will allow panoramic views of the harbour and city.
The scheme will also have a double basement with space for 160 cars and a 975 square metre gym.
There will also be a large town hall space that can be used for hosting events and conferences. Other staff amenities will include a coffee shop and wine bar/restaurant.
According to JCD, Penrose Dock will help bring balance to the development of the docklands, with both quays being built out concurrently and in an historic area of the city where there has been a strategic focus by city planners for some time.
The private commercial property company wants the scheme to achieve the Platinum LEED standard, making it the first office building outside of Dublin to do so.
Penrose Dock has the potential to accommodate more than 2,200 employees. It is an eight-minute walk to St Patrick Street, the city’s main retail thoroughfare and, next to the rejuvenated McCurtain Street, will help to enhance the Victorian Quarter and feed into the district’s thriving bar, café and restaurant trade.
The developer hopes the scheme, located beside Kent station, will complement the existing and planned schemes such as One Albert Quay and Navigation Square on the south quays, as well as Horgan’s Quay with its proposed hotel, 240 apartments and office scheme.
Penrose Dock was designed by the same award-winning architects as the Capitol, Wilson Architecture.
John Cleary, JCD Group’s chief executive, said: “We have travelled to see many similar schemes in other progressive cities around the world and we feel that the design, location and overall offering of Penrose Dock will prove very attractive to technology and financial services companies that are looking to grow their existing footprint or invest in Cork for the first time.
“These companies wish to offer their employees the best places to work, which are easily accessible from a public transport perspective and close to amenities such as gyms, bars, shops and restaurants. It is our intention, subject to receiving acceptable planning permission, to commence construction immediately.”
The Penrose Dock development is expected to take up to 18 months to complete, and will sustain 250 construction jobs during the build.

Name: Roman Abramovich
Age: 51
Appearance: unshaven absentee Chelsea owner
Newsworthiness: the British authorities have failed to renew the Russian billionaire’s resident’s visa
The proxy war raging between Moscow and the West has put Russia’s most well-known oligarch and famously media-shy Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich firmly in the international headlines.
The billionaire business mogul was unable to attend the English FA Cup final last week to witness his team defeat Manchester United, securing Chelsea’s eighth FA Cup title in the London club’s 118-year history, because the British authorities did not renew the Knightsbridge resident’s visa.
London has hit back at the Vladimir Putin-controlled Kremlin after former Russian military officer and British spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were the victims of an assassination attempt when they were poisoned with a Russian-made nerve agent in Salisbury last March.
The British government accused Russia of attempted murder and introduced a number of punitive measures against Moscow, including the expulsion of diplomats. London had the support of 28 other countries which responded in a similar fashion – all told, an unprecedented 153 Russian diplomats were expelled from western countries – including one from Ireland.
Moscow says it had nothing to do with the Skripal attack and claims the British response is just more evidence of ‘anti-Russian’ sentiment. “If the British government continues taking anti-Russian measures, we will hit back under the principle of reciprocity,” Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said at the time.
As relations between London and Moscow tumbled into deep freeze, the British authorities targeted the rules surrounding the granting of visas to wealthy foreigners. Tier 1 investment visas are currently issued to more than 700 wealthy Russian individuals. Abramovich’s visa ran out in April and the new rules mean applications can be rejected if officials believe the applicant is not in control of funds, that money has been obtained unlawfully, or the origin of funds means granting a visa will not be conducive to the public good.
In a separate move last week, a British parliamentary committee published a report which claimed the government there was putting the country’s national security at risk by allowing “kleptocrats and human rights abusers to use the City of London to launder their ill-gotten funds”.
The report, Moscow’s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK, by the foreign affairs committee in Westminster criticised the government for its failure to tackle international money laundering. It suggested that lax policies are putting money “directly into the hands of regimes that would harm the UK, its interests and its allies”.
“Putin and his allies have been able to continue ‘business as usual’ by hiding and laundering their corrupt assets in London,” the report said.
“These assets, on which the Kremlin can call at any time, both directly and indirectly support president Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy.”
Abramovich’s wealth and his closeness to the Russian president may well prove problematic for the Chelsea owner. Claims made during a legal battle fought in a London court in 2012 between Abramovich and fellow oligarch Boris Berezovsky may not help either.
Berezovsky, a former mentor and business partner of Abramovich, claimed in court he was owed $6.5 billion for his share of oil giant Sibneft, a holding he claimed he was forced to sell to Abramovich at a knockdown price after Berezovsky fell out with Putin and was forced to flee to London in 2000 and seek asylum from the British authorities.
Abramovich claimed the pair were never in a partnership, and that Berezovsky acted merely as krysha, or protection. Krysha is the Russian word for roof, but it carries a lot more connotations; a krysha provides political access, lobbying services, introductions and physical protection from organised criminals and gangs. It is a long-term relationship with more or less regular payments.
Abramovich said he was treated as “a cash cow” by Berezovsky, giving him $2.5 billion over six years. “I was not his protégé, and he was not my mentor. With the benefit of hindsight I hesitate to call him a former close friend,” Abramovich told the court.
“I am not his keeper and I have no obligation, legal or moral, to fund his lifestyle or attempt to indulge his fantastic demands.”
Berezovsky denied the payments were for political protection, claiming they were for his share of the profits from his stake in Sibneft and from other investments the pair made in the aluminium sector. He also claimed in court that Abramovich gave Putin a gift of a superyacht worth $50 million, “after Putin instructed him to do so” and that Abramovich “played a central role in the selection of members of president Putin’s cabinet”.
For Abramovich, who hasn’t given an interview in over ten years, the courtroom revelations were an inconvenience to say the least, but with his net worth in 2012 standing at $12 billion, Berezovsky was coming after half his fortune.
The court battle was billed at the time as the most expensive litigation in British history, with both sides hiring scores of the country’s top barristers to fight the case which lasted for four months in London’s Commercial Court. Some estimates put the costs north of £100 million.
In the end, the judge ruled in Abramovich’s favour and said Berezovsky had been an “inherently unreliable” witness. Berezovsky said he was shocked at the decision and claimed the judge had rewritten Russian history.
“On my analysis of the entirety of the evidence, I found Mr Berezovsky an unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes,” the judge said. The judge found Abramovich to be “a truthful, and on the whole reliable, witness”.
Roman Abramovich was born in Lithuania in 1966. His mother died when he was just one-and-a-half years old as a result of complications from a medical procedure; two years later his father was killed in an industrial accident while at work.
He was taken in by his father’s brother and brought up for the next few years in the desolate region of Komi in the Russian Arctic circle. The harsh region has long periods of darkness in the winter and thick permafrost hiding vast reserves of oil. In 1974, he moved to Moscow to live with his grandparents.
Abramovich had two unsuccessful stints at college before serving for two years in the Soviet army where he cultivated a profitable sideline in trading in contraband with fellow soldiers and officers – a not uncommon pursuit in Soviet-era Russia.
After completing his army service, Abramovich returned to Moscow where he met and married his first wife Olga Lysova in 1987. With a wedding gift of cash from his parents-in-law he started selling plastic toys from an apartment in Moscow; business boomed and soon Abramovich moved into manufacturing. The perestroika regime in the dying days of Soviet Russia presented plenty of business opportunities for the savvy Abramovich and he soon moved his attention to trading in oil and oil products. Abramovich went on to take control of an oil refinery, consolidating his business interests, and by 1996, at the age of 30, he had become so rich and politically well connected that he was invited by the Yeltsin family to move into an apartment in the Kremlin.
Abramovich went on to cement his credentials as an oligarch when he took control of Sibneft, then Russia’s fifth largest oil company, during the controversial privatisation of Russian state assets in the 1990s. When Abramovich went on to sell Sibneft to the Russian state-owned Gazprom in 2005, he personally walked away from the deal with $13 billion.
It was during this period that Abramovich cultivated his relationship with Putin and it was on Putin’s insistence that he ran for the position of governor of Russia’s remote, eastern province of Chukotka. Abramovich served as governor from 2000 to 2008 where he spent hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money to rebuild the impoverished region. At the same time the position afforded him the opportunity to restructure the ownership of his assets under Russian law.
So what impact will the British visa move have on the billionaire? Abramovich is estimated to be worth $11.5 billion; he owns a fleet of superyachts and private jets. His 533-foot yacht, Eclipse, has two helicopter pads, 24 guest cabins, two swimming pools and a submarine. Despite reports that the billionaire is cruising with friends in the Caribbean, publicly available tracking data puts the Eclipse as currently moored off Antibes on the French Riviera, where Abramovich owns an estate on the Cap d’Antibes peninsula
His Boeing 767, which has the same air missile avoidance system as Air Force One, last flew from Moscow to Nice on May 8, according to data from the website FlightRadar24.
He owns palatial homes in London, Moscow, New York and Saint Martin and, according to reports in the Israeli media last week, is in the process of building a mansion in Tel Aviv’s Neve Tzedek neighbourhood. Abramovich is a frequent visitor to Israel and has given generously to Jewish communities in Russia. He received a special award from the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia for his contributions of over $500 million to Jewish causes in Israel and Russia over the past 20 years.
Some reports suggest that Abramovich has already put London in his rearview mirror and has secured residency in the state of Israel. On the downside, he may not be able to attend Wembley Stadium on August 5 to see his FA Cup-winning Chelsea side take on runaway English Premier League champions Manchester City in the Community Shield.

When Tom Clinch was asked if his firm, Clinch Wealth Management, would be interested in sponsoring this year’s Irish Law Awards, he had no hesitation in accepting.
As managing director of a company providing specialist pension, investment and inheritance planning expertise to Ireland’s leading professionals and entrepreneurs, Clinch counts many solicitors among his clients and was always impressed by what he saw.
“Solicitors are natural clients for us in the sense that we look after people who need somebody to look after all their financial affairs,” he said. “For us, we model the way we do business – and present ourselves to clients – on the legal profession rather than financial institutions which we deal with all the time. We find the legal world has a different set of standards in that they set themselves very high standards.
“You leave a meeting with them feeling that these people really have an understanding and grasp of what you want to do, and their responsiveness is prompt and efficient. I was aware of the awards last year, and then I was asked if I would be interested in sponsoring them, and the answer was ‘yes’, I was very happy to do it.”
Clinch said the legal profession in Ireland had perfected good presentation and professionalism, with very high standards in how it worked and operated.
“We’ve been struck over a number of years we’ve been working with a number of professionals by the quality of legal firms, not just in the way they provide their services, but in the way that they present themselves – their communication and websites are absolutely top quality,” he said.
“You come across a firm like Beauchamps, who won the top award of Law Firm of the Year on the night, and you only have to look at their website to see that it just oozes quality. Everything about them is professional. I know, from my own experience of dealing with legal firms and representing their clients, that their commitment to excellence is an example to every other profession.”
Clinch Wealth Management is a thriving business managing over €300 million in equity, property, bond and multi-asset portfolios. Established by Clinch’s parents 30 years ago, the company has grown over the last 15 years and now has a staff of 15.
“We’re dealing with professionals and entrepreneurs who don’t suffer fools gladly and, very often, they will ask to be introduced to a solicitor, whether that’s for a will or something else. So we always pick from whom we believe are the best, and my experiences with solicitors have always been fantastic,” he said. “We’re not a mass-market business, we’re a specialist private client company.”
Clinch Wealth Management’s success speaks for itself, with the team predicting correctly the fall of Ireland’s property market in good time to steer client business away from that area, and keeping a clean sheet where good governance is concerned.
“Thankfully over the years, we’ve managed to have a very good track record in our investment advice and managed to see things like the property crash coming and advise our clients to get out and our clients can diversify and not be over exposed to Irish banks,” Clinch said. “What we’re most proud of is our immaculate track record with the regulator. In 30 years, we’ve never had a complaint to the Ombudsman or to the regulator.”

Body


A referendum to remove the reference in the Constitution to a woman’s place being in the home is on course to take place in October.
The government is close to finalising the preparatory work for the vote to reform or remove article 41.2 which deals with the role and rights of women.
It states: “In particular, the state recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.
“The state shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.”
The referendum was recommended by the Constitutional Convention, as was the removal of Article 40.6.1 on the offence of blasphemy.
They will both take place on the same day as a presidential election, if there is one, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said.
Cabinet approval is expected in the coming weeks with a view to the publication of relevant Bills before the Dáil breaks for summer.
“This will ensure that a referendum commission can be established in a timely manner and will ensure that the commission will have adequate time within which to begin its preparatory work,” said Flanagan.
“Funding arrangements have been put in place within my Department and contact has been maintained with both the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Office of the Ombudsman, both of which will have key roles to play in relation to the referendum process.”
The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against women called for the “stereotypical language on the role of women in the home” to be removed from the Constitution. It has also been a longstanding concern of the National Women’s Council who say it’s “completely outdated”.
However, the removal may not be as straightforward as it appears.
The article has been used in legal cases including divorce settlements in calculating the wife’s share in the matrimonial home.

1983: a constitutional amendment proposing that the state recognise and vindicate the right to life of the unborn as equal to that of the mother is passed in a referendum by 67 per cent to 33 per cent.
1986: the High Court rules that the availability to Irish women of information on abortion services outside the state is in breach of Article 40.3.3 of the constitution as it undermines the unborn child’s right to life. The Supreme Court later affirms this ruling.
1992: attorney general Harry Whelehan goes to the High Court in a bid to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. The injunction is granted, but after the ruling is appealed the Supreme Court deems that the girl’s life is at risk because she is suicidal and therefore she is legally entitled to an abortion. The girl later suffered a miscarriage.
November 2002: three referendums on abortion are held. The Twelfth Amendment proposes that the possibility of suicide was not a sufficient threat to justify an abortion. This is rejected, but the 13th and 14th amendments are passed, entitling Irish women to freedom to travel for abortion and to obtain information about abortion services in other countries respectively.
2002: the government holds another referendum to try to exclude the risk of suicide as grounds for an abortion. It forms part of a number of measures aimed at addressing crisis pregnancies in Ireland, including new penalties of up to 12 years in jail for anyone performing or assisting an abortion. It is defeated by 50.4 per cent and 49.6 per cent.
2010: the European Court of Human Rights rules that the state has failed to provide clarity on the availability of abortion in circumstances where a mother’s life is at risk following a legal case brought by three women.
2012: Indian-born dentist Savita Halappanavar, 31, dies in University Hospital Galway after from complications arising from septic miscarriage at 17 weeks. Her husband says they repeatedly asked for an abortion, but were refused because there was a foetal heartbeat. The case triggers outrage, protests and a national conversation about Irish abortion law.
2013: after much parliamentary debate, the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill is passed, setting the parameters for abortion in case of risk to life, including suicide.
2015: Taoiseach Enda Kenny announces plans, if re-elected, to establish a Citizens’ Assembly to discuss the Eighth Amendment and whether Constitutional change is needed.
April 2017: after extensive hearings, the assembly recommends a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment be held, and that the Oireachtas legislate for abortion on request up to 12 weeks.
December 2017: a special Oireachtas committee broadly endorses the findings of the assembly paving the way for a referendum on the Eighth Amendment to be held.
March 2018: the polling date is set for May 25. Voters are asked to vote Yes or No on the 36th Amendment of the Constitution which would replace Article 40.3.3 with: “Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.”

Highlight: The NCH marks the 100th anniversary of Debussy’s death with a special trio of concerts, performed by the outstanding pianist Thérèse Fahy, an acknowledged authority on the composer 
Body


Claude Debussy was a radical from the outset. As a student, he continually failed his harmony exams because, like Beethoven a century before him, he refused to accept the absolute authority of the textbook. A brilliant pianist, he would shock his contemporaries by inventing harmonies and chords that effectively reinterpreted tonality – already he was moving towards the creation of musical impressionism.
He was, in short, a revolutionary who pushed classical music into complete new areas of tonality. Along with his countryman Maurice Ravel, he became one of the most prominent figures associated with impressionist music, although Debussy himself disliked the term.
He once said: “I believe with all my heart that music remains for all time the finest means of expression we have.”
On another occasion, he said: “There’s no need for music to make people think . . . it would be enough if music made them listen.”
The NCH marks the 100th anniversary of Debussy’s death with a special trio of concerts, performed by the outstanding pianist Thérèse Fahy, an acknowledged authority on the composer and a specialist in French music. In 2012, she toured the east coast of the United States performing Debussy’s 24 preludes in celebration of the 150th anniversary of his birth.
Fahy says: “My three-concert series mainly features the late works of Debussy, his death and legacy, and it explores his themes of water, childhood and spirituality. It also highlights his passionate interest in Celtic legend, Spain – though he spent just one day there — Italy and Greek muses. Above all, it shows his deep love for the piano and its infinite sonic potential to display his extraordinary imagination.”
The concerts also include works by Bartók, Ravel, Satie and Dukas, among others.
Accompanying Fahy for the NCH concerts will be a top-notch team of violinist Elaine Clarke, cellist Martin Johnson, flautist Madeleine Staunton, soprano Kathleen Tynan, guitarist Benjamin Dwyer and accordionist Dermot Dunne.
The series, funded by the Arts Council, will be repeated later at the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris.
The Dublin International Piano Competition is one of the great achievements in putting Ireland on the global music map, and much credit must go to John O’Conor, whose guidance down the years has been crucial to its success.
Since its emergence in 1988, the contest has produced a string of brilliant winners who have gone on to international acclaim. The first winner was Philippe Cassard, a magical pianist who has retained his links with the NCH to this day, as have many other victors such as Finland’s Antti Siirala (2003), Ukraine’s Alexej Gorlatch (2009), Russia’s Nikolay Khozyainov (2012) and France’s Nathalia Milstein (2015) - the first woman winner.
The 2018 competition preliminary rounds with 62 competitors will be held at the Royal Dublin Society throughout the coming week with the semi-finals next Saturday and Sunday at the National Concert Hall and the grand final of four competitors, backed by the RTÉ NSO, battling it out at the same venue the following Tuesday, May 29.
South Korea (10) dominates the qualifying list, with Ireland (6), Russia (6), China (6), US (5), and Japan (5) making up the numbers.
The Irish candidates are Billy O’Brien, Cathal Masterson, Antonia Huang, Peter Regan, JJ McNamara and Eoin Fleming.
Prices: RDS sessions, €7; NCH semi-finals, €12; NCH final, €38-€49.

How do artists respond to music? An interesting experiment carried out last year by Galway artist Finbar McHugh with the ConTempo Quartet at a sell-out show in Nun’s Island Theatre in Galway is being repeated on Thursday, May 31 with a renewed focus and a fresh space.
Painting By Music is a silent event in which the audience will respond to the music, working in simple ways to create a visual representation of their collective experience as an audience. The concept of process, rather than the final result, is at the heart of the project.

Repeal of Eighth achieved by reaching across party lines

Highlight: The landslide result may herald a new era of European-style ‘new politics’, cross-party consensus and collaboration 
Body


On the way into the RDS yesterday morning, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald turned to her adviser in the car and said: “This is new politics. It’s not about Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael working together, it’s about the people leading politicians and not the other way around.”
The decision by the people to abolish the constitutional ban on abortion heralds significant and profound change not just for Irish society, but for Irish politics as we know it.
On a superficial level, it has changed the way that the main parties interact with each other. Party boundaries have broken down as politicians from either side have often found more common cause with those wearing different party colours than with their own colleagues.
The process of deliberative democracy with the referendum originating from the Citizens’ Assembly, as well as a far greater than usual level of engagement between politicians and civil society groups, will strongly influence the process of how policies are arrived at in the future.
On a much deeper level, the emergence of a more liberal and progressive society, the degree of which caught many politicians by surprise, will have an underlying impact on where parties position themselves on the ideological map into the future.
In the more immediate term, the referendum result is likely to change the perception of all the main parties in a way that is likely to impact electorally and largely dictate the seat numbers in the next Dáil.
The argument has been made that the marriage equality referendum result did not translate to the general election. The Labour Party, for example, which was to the forefront of that campaign, was not thanked for it electorally, nor were its candidates who strongly advocated for a Yes vote, most of whom lost their seats.
There is a sense that things could be different on this occasion. Fine Gael is likely to be seen to have won this. The party followed through on its promise to deal with it in the lifetime of this government and can now argue that it was true to its word. It did not shirk away from what threatened to be a difficult issue with the potential to divide parties and society at large.
The result will copperfasten Leo Varadkar’s image as a young, progressive taoiseach and the large cohort who voted for change are likely to look to him as the leader that best represents their view of a modern Ireland.
The process of tearing up the conservative customs of De Valera’s Constitution will continue into the autumn as the legislation regulating terminations will go through the Oireachtas while another referendum, on the removal of the constitutional wording referring to women’s place being in the home, is held in October.
Fine Gael has also shown itself to have been open and flexible to change, through the publicly played-out conversion of the Tánaiste, Simon Coveney, from ardent opponent of any liberalisation of abortion laws to a passionate proponent of a regime that is more compassionate and which recognises the reality of what is already taking place.
The star of Minister for Health Simon Harris has risen throughout the campaign. He was perceived as authentic, sincere and convincing in debates and threw himself enthusiastically into going out to canvass for a Yes vote.
Harris’s job is not yet done, as he will have to ensure the smooth passage of the legislation regulating abortion through the Dáil without undue delays and in a manner that is watertight legally to avoid any future High Court challenge.
He wisely handled the decision to publish the proposed outline of the legislation so that the argument can be made that the people knew exactly what they were voting for. Harris knew there was a lot at stake. In the count centre in the RDS yesterday, he said: “I have never been more nervous. I don’t mind going into an RTÉ studio defending a government position. But with this I was advocating for something that was far more important than just me.”
Sinn Féin, too, will benefit from the generational shift to a more liberal society. Mary Lou McDonald was the only party leader to put her face to posters calling for a Yes vote, and was the most vocal woman politician on the issue.
The timing of the referendum could not have been better for McDonald, giving her an unrivalled opportunity to refresh the party brand.
The campaign has also put Sinn Féin in the mainstream political picture. Photo opportunities involving civic society groups and representatives from other political parties will help in the (although they dislike the use of the term) normalisation of Sinn Féin.
The sight of McDonald hugging a government minister, Katherine Zappone, in the RDS yesterday is something we could not have countenanced with the baggage that Sinn Féin carried under Gerry Adams’s leadership.
This process of bringing Sinn Féin into the centre of Irish politics will only be enhanced when Fine Gael is forced to call on its support to get the legislation on abortion passed through the Dáil. This puts Sinn Féin in poll position to show that the process of change cannot be done without it.
The big unknown from this campaign is what impact it will have on Fianna Fáil. While party leader Micheál Martin enthusiastically backed repeal of the Eighth Amendment, the majority of his parliamentary party did not.
There may be some benefit in the fact that they are the only party that now represents the No vote. Fianna Fáil might be the only home for the one-third or so of the electorate who voted against abolition of the Eighth Amendment.
But this is not a space that Martin will be comfortable occupying. His party needs to appeal to the large swathe of young, urban and new voters who are energised by the referendum campaign. As of now, his party looks like being left behind by this group. Fianna Fáil, which has historically built its success on being a catch-all party, will now have to define itself ideologically.
The immediate task, for now, will be to get the legislation through the Dáil. Varadkar and Fine Gael are on the crest of a wave, and the urge to go to the electorate over the summer will be strong. When asked yesterday if there is likely to be an election before the laws are passed, Harris said: “That is above my pay grade.”
The referendum, as well as the marriage equality referendum, mobilised the youth vote in a way that hasn’t been seen before in this country. The task for many TDs on the left is to translate this into activism in other areas.
It will be interesting to watch, in the aftermath of this historic referendum, how parties work together in the future - and whether a more European-style consensual approach to legislating, what new politics was supposed to be about, will emerge.
“All of the party leaders have transcended normal party politics, and maybe there is a lesson in that - if you are a little less partisan, maybe you can get more things done this country,” Harris said.
“The political system and political parties working together has been a really powerful moment in this campaign, and I think we should all learn from that. The fact that I turn on the TV and cheer on a politician who is not wearing my party colours, and vice versa, is very powerful.”
And that, surely, is an historical first in Irish politics.

Rwanda memoir confronts accepted narratives of conflict and survival

MEMOIR: The Girl Who Smiled Beads, By Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth Weil, Hutchinson, €21
‘I was often cast as a martyr or a saint. I was special, very special. So strong, so brave, a genocide princess, definitely not just one of the many dozens of dark migrant bodies crammed into a flimsy boat, the ones they saw in those horrifying images on the front page of the New York Times . . .”
Clemantine Wamariya knows what people expect from refugee narratives but, in The Girl Who Smiled Beads, she tells her story of near-impossible survival on her own terms. Co-written with author and journalist Elizabeth Weil, her memoir spans six years and seven different countries, following Wamariya’s flight from Rwanda during the genocide in 1994.
At six years old, Clemantine and her older sister, Claire, are separated from their family. Adrift, they pass through a series of camps and temporary homes, and develop a talent for survival. They subsist on grains and occasional vitamins pills, sleeping on mats while insects burrow into the skin on their feet. They cross borders, hustle for food and lose everything, over and over, until Wamariya – still a child – looks in the mirror and sees someone she no longer recognises.
The consequences of the 1994 massacre, lasting less than a year, are still felt today (news stories appeared earlier this month of the discovery of newly-discovered mass graves where bodies are identifiable only by their clothing). Rwanda is landlocked and small, but the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis by the Hutus uprooted roughly 550,000 survivors who fled to surrounding states.
Beyond their search for shelter, sustenance and home, Clemantine and Claire’s journey maps the ripples of discord and dispossession following conflict, which very rarely limit themselves to a single country. Besides the looming possibilities of starvation, rape and violence, there lies another kind of torture: the girls are kept in the dark, unsure where they’re going to be sent to next, if their parents are alive, and if they’ve been granted asylum or are about to be arrested and locked up.
Their story moves at a breakneck pace, with chapters alternating between Africa and America, where the sisters are eventually granted refugee status. This purposely-broken narrative mirrors the fractured memories of its narrator. Wamariya writes: “My life does not feel logical, sequential or inevitable. There is no sense in action, reaction; no consequence, repercussion; no plot. It’s just fragments . . .”
Conflict forces the girls to grow up quickly, but a part of them is suspended in childhood. As her account of the past begins to link up with the present, Wamariya’s account becomes a study of memory, and exploring the tensions between ‘marketable’ stories of survival and their more complex realities.
Wamariya shot to fame when she was won an essay contest and was reunited with her parents live on the Oprah Winfrey Show, but the story behind this moment – preserved today in a YouTube clip watched hundreds of thousands of times – is significantly more complicated.
Wamariya writes that, while profoundly grateful, she “also felt kicked in the stomach, as though my life [was some] experiment: let’s see how far we can take a person down, and then how far we can raise her up, and then let’s see what happens!”
This is not a story of triumph against all odds; rather, it’s an exploration of what happens when hardship becomes a part of oneself. In her new life Wamariya is clearly traumatised; ambitious, yet bitter, she writes to make sense of her memories, to string them together like beads in an arrangement that makes sense.
Yet she comments on the failure of words (and, in one interesting scene, a play she watches which has been staged to commemorate the genocide) to describe genocide, a term which defeats itself.
Her writing is strongest, and bravest, when it confronts the impossibility of expressing this pain at all. She writes: “There are moments for which I still have no vocabulary . . . The memory makes me want to burn everything, raze the whole galaxy, and my brain won’t hold the plot. But I have to keep trying – we have to keep trying. I have to find a way to tell you: this happened.”

Ireland wrestled with its past and, through a landslide ballot few had predicted or even thought possible, has now voted to redefine its future. Young, old. Women, men. Urban, rural. Liberal, conservative.
The scale of the vote on Friday to repeal the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution reveals an unprecedented unity in this country, a unity of conviction that we have rarely witnessed before.
It is as close to a universal endorsement as is imaginable in a functioning democracy, made all the more astonishing by the fact that this verdict has been passed on an issue which has been the most enduring and divisive thread in the Irish social fabric. This was not just a profound statement by the young people of Ireland, although they played a huge role in the civic activism that underpinned the campaign. The scale of the Yes went beyond class, gender and age. Ireland made a united decision to repeal the Eighth Amendment, therefore allowing abortions in the state.
It marks a decisive turning point, as well, in Irish women’s often troubled relationship with the state.
The outcome voters have delivered is no mere wind, but a hurricane. Instead of division across generations and boundaries, it is a landslide that represents a sea change in social attitudes.
The marriage equality vote, a milestone occasion just three years ago, was billed as a turning point. However, the decision to repeal the Eighth Amendment represents a monumental shift in public attitudes. Ireland has come to a firm view that women should have full rights to autonomy over their bodies, and that it is no longer acceptable to export our moral conundrum to another country.
It has done so within a framework that was simultaneously pragmatic and ambitious in its goals of allowing the people of Ireland to frame and determine the question they would be asked.
Abortion has long been a daily reality in this country, but it has simply happened behind closed doors and with no medical support.
Much of the debate around liberalising Ireland’s abortion laws has centred on tragic cases involving rape and incest victims, suicidal asylum-seekers, cancer patients and women who discovered the child they hoped for had fatal foetal abnormalities.
These cases may only represent a small percentage of Irish abortions, but they have slowly changed and shaped public opinion.
When the Citizens’ Assembly made its recommendations on the Eighth Amendment, there was a sense that assembly members had gone further than the public expected by backing the right to abortion in a wide range of circumstances.
The Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment subsequently came to a similar view.
A number of committee members described how their view changed and evolved after hearing all of the evidence from experts.
Society was faced with a choice. Close their eyes to an ongoing reality or change the law. The overwhelming view of the people was to change the law.
What next? First, the Oireachtas must respond and enact the overwhelming will expressed on Friday. The outcome is meaningless without the legislation that follows and this needs to happen as soon as possible. Short-term political gains must be ignored. Those who voted will be unforgiving if the referendum result is used for electoral advantage. Furthermore, the will of the people is so clear that politicians of all parties and views owe it to the people to implement their will.
There are also wider implications of this vote. Approaching the centenary of the foundation of the state, there have been several moments in our recent history that have stood out. Divorce, gay rights and now abortion: a trio of divisive subjects that have sparked the most vociferous of debates, but have been passed. The pace has been incredible and it will spur on those looking for greater social change.
The impact of these votes, and the constituencies they have energised and created, will shape Irish politics and culture for a generation or more. This country has been widely painted and pilloried as conservative and inward-looking. It was claimed that a silent majority were against change. That theory has been blown apart.
On social issues that once caused bitter division, the public are ahead of their elected officials. Nonetheless, the skill of the governments which enacted these referendums, and charted a course through politically hazardous waters, must be acknowledged.
It would also be a failure not to acknowledge that the No campaign did have its own support. After all, several hundred thousand people voted against the proposal.
Those who voted No did so in good conscience, and their convictions are deeply and honestly held, even if, at times, certain figures in the campaign sought to peddle disturbing untruths.
In 1983, there was a clear, unambiguous vote in favour of the pro-life amendment: the people made a very clear statement.
As this newspaper wrote in the aftermath of the X case in 1992: “The people who voted in favour of the pro-life amendment are neither callous nor ruthless nor hard-hearted nor primitive. They were in large measure driven by life-affirming principles.”
The pro-life body is entitled to their view, in the same way that the pro-choice movement is entitled to theirs.
However, the scale of the yes vote is so utterly comprehensive as to ensure there are no lingering divisions in the aftermath of the ballot.
The Ireland of 1983 bears no relation to the Ireland of today. Ireland has clearly changed, and that change has been breathtaking in its speed and its scope.
The state has on many levels confronted its past, embraced peace, modernised its economy and generally improved the lives of its citizens.
Ireland has judged that the Eighth Amendment was outdated, an instrument of harm. The people have clearly decided that the damage it wrought was tangible, that the pain and wounds it caused were real, and that the time had come for repeal. It is now time to heal those wounds.
It was the sweeping nature of Friday’s decision that stands out.
As the results flowed in yesterday, it was clear that the political and social kaleidoscope had been shaken and the outcome had been one that nobody had ever imagined. Ireland has changed fundamentally.

Short Story 3rd place: The Knot
Sunday Business Post

Length: 2724 words
Byline: Post Reporter
Highlight: This short story by Michelle Coyne resonated strongly with the judges. The Knot is a story about the body, and the mind, and the relationship between the two 
Body


The treatment room smells of eucalyptus and the cooking tick of a portable heater. I imagine the osteopath’s breath flooding my chest like valley mist, seeping warm into the cotton of my t-shirt. Above me, his jaw clenches, the hard rise of bone below his ear, the shy blunt hairs of his cheek still flush with his skin from shaving.
I feel his fingers under my back, his knuckles slotting into the grooves between my backbones as he follows the ladder of my spine down from my neck. His knuckle finds the spot and his breath, for one instant, shortens. Not a gasp, but a tiny huff of realisation. He’s found it, the source of my pain. The knot.
He rocks his knuckles over and back across it, and I can feel it tighten against him, dig deeper into my body.
“Okay,” he says and rearranges my arms, crosses them, puts my hands on opposite shoulders like the wing-fold of a bat. He cups both my elbows in his palm and presses down gently on top of me. I see his Adam’s apple bob, and feel his knuckles still soft on the knot.
“Breathe in,” he says, and I do. I gasp it, fill myself like a balloon. Empty and full all at once.
“Breathe out,” and I do, a huge expelling, shuddering out, and he drops his weight on me, pressing me down onto his waiting knuckles. I feel the knot give way a little; I think it’s going to go, release all its energy in a satisfying click, but it just strings tight again.
The last gasp out of my lungs, his frustrated head tilt, and, mortifyingly, my tears are spilling all down into my ears.
He stands back and I lay a forearm over my eyes and sniff.
His hand is on my shoulder. “Are you okay?”
“Yeah,” I croak and can feel the sour line my mouth is making. “It hurts. It just won’t go.”
“It will,” he says.
I give a little bitter ha. It’s not worth laughing about.
“It will,” he says, “trust me.”
It doesn’t matter if I trust him or not; it won’t go. I have nowhere else to put it.
I wake up in the dark, much too early. It’s the pain, or thinking about the pain, or the irritating ease of Lukasz’s sleep next to me in bed. Gripping the edge of the bedside table, I get up to find my runners.
I have a route, a four mile circuit from my door, back to my door. I used to run it, before everything, before the knot dragged my bones out of place. Now it’s a walk. Down the steep hill, then a mile and a half on the flat, along the runway of a distributor road. And then after the turn for the new cemetery, two miles on a gentle incline curving back home, the footpath and the streetlights ending just after the graveyard gates.
This morning I can feel my pulse hop in my throat as I dig my stride into the downhill slope in the dark. Feel the wind of the knot below my left shoulder blade. The dim orange streetlights hum, and distant cars sail across newly-laid asphalt. The smell of decay, of leaves blown to the walls and rained on. The street sweepers have already swung by, churning the leaves and debris into their bodies, but you can smell the rot regardless.
It’s lit like midday on the distributor road, the council having chosen searing white, star-obscuring lamps over plain old orange sodium for the stretch. There’s no hiding; you can see everything and everyone whether you want to see them or not. Other walkers or joggers, buttoned and scarved against the nip of wind. Dog-walkers, faces bowed to their phones. New mothers parading themselves with prams so sophisticated you can almost forget what’s within, swaddled and shielded from the wind and the world. I press in my earphones to listen to a podcast, and escape the tunnel of myself for a mile or so.
This morning, it’s popular science, and a group of people are talking about artificial intelligence, about the Turing test, about how we might deem technology to be sentient. They move on to robotics and the narcissism of human-like robotic design, how humans fail to fathom that something could be better designed than themselves. How sentient technology, when it exists, will bear little resemblance to us.
The wind burns my cheeks and I close my eyes for a moment and let the notion of my own insignificance settle over me, make me feel looser, make the knot soften.
“We don’t often consider the ethics,” a woman with one of those plummy English accents says in my earphones. “We think about creating this intelligence, but we don’t consider the possibility that our creation might suffer. The question is always, ‘Can we?’ We rarely ask, ‘Should we?’”
She laughs then, before she delivers the punchline. “That said, can we consider an intelligence to be truly alive if it does not suffer? Suffering is surely one of the hallmarks of life.”
I open my eyes to the streetlit concrete pavement, pulling the wire of my earphones so they pop out. Stupid cow. I push my tongue against the backs of my teeth. Stupid English cow. I keep moving, going to the turn where the streetlights change back to orange, where I battle up the incline. Where no pram dares venture.
My calves hurt from the climb, the knot wrenches with every step, but I don’t want to slow down. I want to feel it and let it hurt me. Where the hill arcs towards home, the new cemetery sleeps on the far side of a high stone wall. I can see the tops of the taller headstones from the path, the mock of them. I drop my head and focus on the path, the clean cinch of pain in my shoulder, the colour draining from everything as I get further and further from the streetlights.
The dish water is scalding as I push my hand in and fish out a knife to rub. Outside petunias spill from an over-planted pot, dry and leggy from neglect. Grass tufts between the paving stones. I hear Lukasz behind me, the shuffle of his feet on the tiles. The annoying consideration he shows, tip-toeing around me like I’m a wounded wolf.
“Why did you throw the calendar out?” I say to the kitchen window. I hear his caught breath, envision him crumple.
“I didn’t want . . . I thought it would be for the best.”
“You thought.”
“Catherine . . .”
“You should have asked me.”
“I should have asked you. I’ll get another one.”
“No,” I say, flashing my hand into the sink and hooking a spoon. “Don’t replace it. Just, leave it okay?”
“All right,” he says and comes to stand next to me, picks up a tea-towel and starts drying. “I love you, you know.”
I stop my hands on the spoon and stare down into the sud-topped murk. “Stop treating me like I’m about to break.”
I can see him consider this at the side of my vision. See him thoughtfully dry a bowl. “I don’t think you’re about to break. But I can’t help that I want to take care of you.”
“I can take care of myself.”
“I know,” he says and then says nothing more.
*
Mist sprinkles like pindrops in the white cones of light from the streetlights on the distributor road. It needles my face. In my ears, a woman with a Kiwi accent talks about rubbish in the Pacific Ocean, a continent of plastic gathered by prevailing currents, being ground down further and further into almost nothing, which is then ingested by sea creatures, who are eaten by fish, who are eaten by people. All of this causing hormone disruption, cancer, infertility.
The knot is heavy tonight, like the muscle is made of marble. A rounded edge chipped from one of the cemetery headstones and implanted into my back.
I shower when I get home, lift the night’s mist to steam. When I come out, Lukasz is reading a graphic novel in bed, his legs crossed at the ankle, tugging his hair, biting his lip. It’s how he reads, as though the act itself is agony. On the cover, a baby is breastfeeding, a baby with nub horns on its forehead.
“Can you look at something for me?” I say to him.
He looks up, lip still bit, novel dropping to his lap.
“This knot in my shoulder, it feels, I dunno, huge tonight. It’s killing me.”
“Sure.” He swings his legs out of bed and stands behind me, breath on my neck, and places his thumb to the edge of my scapula and presses.
“Higher,” I say and he pads his thumb higher and higher, and stops when he reaches it.
“It’s like a rock,” he says.
“Really?”
“Well, you know what I mean.” He pushes against it, and I hiss. “Sorry,” he says.
“No. Can you . . . will you try to press it? It might help.”
“Are you sure?” he says and kisses the shower-damp skin below my ear.
“Yeah. Just . . . dig your thumb into it.”
He puts his arm around me, across the front of my chest and takes my opposite shoulder to steady me, and then he presses his thumb against the knot. The pain is electric, radiating, hot. I distil it into a whimper. I bring my hands up and hold his forearm at my chest, brace against him as he presses harder. My eyes shut to the agony and surrender streams of tears down the side of my nose, onto my lips, onto Lukasz’s arm.
“Stop,” I say, and he does, puts his other arm around my waist, forearm flat across my stomach and he holds me as I weep, until I feel stupid, and I turn in his arms and plant my face on his chest. Tears seep into his t-shirt.
He gets into bed after brushing his teeth and puts his lips to the nape of my neck where I have curled away from him, smooths the flat of his palm waist over hip and curve of my backside. I turn to face him, kiss him, feel his erection on my thigh. I want him. I want him.
“Do you want to make love?” he says.
I hesitate, the prospect of past present and future pain alive inside me. I smother all of it. “Yes,” I say. “Yes.”
His mouth on mine. Hands where they go, pressing and holding. Fingers inside me. Yes. And his soft-edging entering me, his kiss, his hand on my thigh, lifting my knee, the press of his pubic bone to me. The turn of my hips. Christ, I have missed this. The fear’s not gone but, put away. It won’t take long, I can hear it on his breath, his losing, his falling inward on himself. In his Oh-Catherines. And I want — No. No, I don’t want. Fear crowds me.
“Stop,” I say, and he freezes. His breath short.
“Are you okay?”
“I can’t.”
He withdraws. “It’s all right,” he says and lies down next to me, kisses me again. “Next time, maybe.”
“Sorry,” I say.
“Don’t be. I understand.” he says, and in that moment I hate him.
I stare at the bags of groceries waiting to be taken in from the boot. I’ve packed them wrong. All the milk and juice and beer into one bag. It was okay when I took it from the trolley into the boot, but my shoulder’s in revolt after the drive home and I . . . I shake open a second bag and start to distribute the weight.
“Afternoon, Catherine.” My neighbour is calling from across the road, turning her dog’s lead in her hand to keep it short. The terrier circles pointlessly at its end.
“Hi Sinéad. Lovely day.” I try to keep my tone curt, keep her from expanding into a conversation, but it’s already too late, she’s halfway across the road in her slate grey crocs.
“Any luck with the job hunt?”
“Oh, no. I’m taking a break from looking, actually.” The carton of milk I’m holding is damp on my palms.
“Really? How come?” I can see, too late, the direction her thoughts are taking. “There isn’t a baby on the way?” she says, eyes dropping crudely to my stomach.
“No. No baby, just a bit fat.”
When she meets my eye, I can see she doesn’t know whether to believe me or not, and I want to hop the carton of milk off her stupid face.
“You shouldn’t wait too long. My Aoife and her husband have had nothing but trouble trying for babies. Six rounds of IVF, can you imagine? But at least they had the twins in the end.”
I slam the boot shut, and her dog startles and yelps.
“That’s great news,” I say as Sinéad blinks at me. “Here, I’ll let you get on. I have to get the groceries put away. Have a good walk.” I retreat into the house and close the door, making the knocker clap, the groceries abandoned in the boot.
In bed, I stare at the ceiling. Lukasz’s sleeping hand is warm on my thigh. I get up and go out walking. There’s nobody else around. The distributor road streetlights are like spotlights on a dark empty stage. Each one lit for me alone. In my earphones a guy is talking to an insomniac comedian. He’s tried to kill himself twice but hasn’t succeeded. It’s not funny.
I’m walking and I can feel myself stooped. I can feel every minute of my age, and this thing, this cancer in my shoulder. Rounding the corner to the darker part of the route, I switch the podcast off and wind my earphones into my pocket.
The orange light bounces dully off the gravestone tops, the flat ha of my breath, as pain reverberates with each footfall. The permanency of the stone, the acknowledgement of the loss engraved into its surface. I have no monument to visit. Nowhere to set my pain down.
My foot curls in my shoe, spasms, pins and needles down my arm, and I feel the stone of the knot jab in my shoulder. I hobble the rest of the way up the dark hill, into the house, keys on the table. I fumble in the kitchen drawer and find a permanent marker, and carry it with me upstairs to the bathroom.
Finger on the switch, the room floods with light and the toilet stands pristine. I bite the lid from the marker, nostrils fill with solvent and I lean over the cistern, and onto its face I squeak the letters. R. I. P.
I stand again and return the marker to its lid and take it from my mouth. I look at the toilet, the ridiculousness of it, the ridiculousness of myself. I laugh and rub my face. Jesus Christ, I’ve lost my mind. I’m fucking nuts.
Placing the marker down I pick up a sponge and squeeze it under the run of water from the sink, and then pass it over the letters on the cistern. It makes no impact, even with a more vigorous scrub. Shit.
I hear Lukasz stir in the bedroom. Shit.
Under the sink I find bleach, and squeeze some onto the sponge.
“Catherine?” He’s behind me, sleepy, confused.
I turn, sponge still in hand. “I’m sorry.”
I see his eyes go to the toilet and he runs his fingers through his hair and tugs.
“I’m sorry,” I say again. “It’s just, just a stupid thing. Nothing. I’m going to clean it off.”
“Why do you do this? Why don’t you talk to me?”
“Why don’t I talk to you?” The blood thuds inside of me. “Why don’t you talk to me?”
“I do,” he says, and thinks again. “I try.”
“No. You never talk about it. It’s like you’ve left me on my own to just, deal with it all, inside my own head, and now you’re standing there judging me for writing on the bloody toilet like it’s some sort of crime.”
Lukasz’s jaw goes tight and he blinks and blinks again. I absently squeeze the sponge and a drop of bleach lands on my runners, leaving a sick red splotch on the purple.
I throw the sponge into the sink, and rinse the bleach from my hand before wrenching off my runner to run water over it. “You probably don’t even know what today is, do you?” I say without looking at him.
“Catherine.” His voice is a cry, a bark. “I do. It would have been today. I do know. What do you think of me?”
When I look up, he has covered his face with a hand, his shoulders hop with sobs.
I turn off the tap. “Lukasz,” I say, and he shakes his head. “Lukasz.”
“It shouldn’t be like this. We shouldn’t be here. We should be meeting him today.”
“Or her,” I say quietly.
“Or her.” He drops his hand, but doesn’t lift his gaze to me. “I’m sad. So sad, and I can’t tell you because it will make you even sadder.”
“You can tell me. I want us to talk about it.”
“No you don’t.”
“I do.”
“No, you prefer to go out and walk.”
I watch him, his slanted stance, his eyes still fixed on the floor, that defeated expression on his face.
“I feel cheated,” I say, and he looks up. “I’m not even sad. I’m just angry. Really really angry. Aren’t you angry?”
He shakes his head.
“No? Just sad?”
“No,” he says, and looks up to the corner where tile meets ceiling. “Lonely.”
My tears come before the thought. I’ve done this to him. I’ve made him lonely. And I realise it’s not angry I am. Not really.
“I’m afraid,” I say, my voice altered.
He gives a little nod and swallows. “I am too.”
I step closer to him, reach for his hand, hook my fingers around his palm. And he pulls me to him, folds himself around me. Drops his cheek to the top of my head. My fingers clutch his t-shirt and I press myself to his chest and hold on, until the shudder goes from his breath, until my foot gets cold on the bathroom tiles.
I close my eyes and breathe in the eucalyptus of the treatment room. The osteopath’s gentle lean of pressure on my folded arms, his knuckles slotted to my spine.
“Are you ready?”
“Yeah,” I say. The light of the bulb overhead is red through my eyelids.
“Okay,” he says, “Take a big breath in.”
And I do.

Highlight: Our winning story, as Brendan Barrington of Penguin Ireland describes it, 'is told in a language that exists at a slight angle to any familiar version of English, and it has a stark formal beauty – but at the same time it carries a deep emotional charge' 
Body


I say to Mama that we need a dog to help us.
“A child is better than a dog, Chiriqi,” she says.
But I want a dog to sit with us.
At night our other women and children share their stories and count their monies. Mama doesn’t like me to be with them.
“We are art, Chiriqi. You must remember the difference.”
Because we are art, I must lie very still every day, with my eyes closed. But when I hear the tip-tip of pigeons’ feet, I open my eyelids in little slits. The pigeons look to me with their black pips shining.
“Yes,” I say to them. “I like you also.”
“Brrrggh,” they say to me and they fluff their feathers. “Brrrggh.”
Mama’s knees are flat and sore every evening from her kneeling.
“Rosinna, why do you not make comfort for yourself?” says Marchinn.
Marchinn is my favourite because she is fat and she laughs.
“Sit back against a wall, Rosinna,” she says to Mama. “In the shade. Strong sun is bad for the brains. And kneeling is very bad for the soul, but even worse for the knees.”
Mama tosses her head.
“We are art, Marchinn. We work for our money.”
Marchinn doesn’t laugh then, like the other women. She slowly shakes her head and points to me.
“This is your daughter, Rosinna, not a lump of art.”
“She is my daughter and she is not a beggar.”
Marchinn sighs a big fat breath.
“Art is not the problem for you, Rosinna. And money is not the problem for you. The problem, Rosinna, is pride.”
But Mama tosses her head and says the last sentence.
“To have no pride is to be dead.”
Then she spits on the floor.
At night, Mama unwraps her scarf and shakes her hair out. I take our silver hairbrush from its place under the bed and I go to her.
“You are my little mirror now, Chiriqi,” she says.
She means I must tell her how she looks. It will be a nice evening if I say the correct and beautiful thing, and Mama and I will sleep softly together. When I am tired or not able to know what Mama wants, our sleep is fighty. I am lucky because, early this morning, I saw water shining in a bowl in the dark, and I remembered it for tonight. I take our silver brush and I lift it to Mama’s hair.
“How is my hair tonight, Chiriqi?”
“Your hair is shining like water in a dark and beautiful bowl,” I say.
Mama is happy and she closes her eyes.
“What is the bowl made from, Chiriqi?”
This also I know and have thought about. It would be wrong and unhappy to say the truth; the bowl is made of plastic. So I say, “The bowl is made of a beautiful black stone, so smooth and so perfect.”
“And where does the light come from, Chiriqi?”
I will not say from a light bulb. Mama despises the light bulbs.
“From the moon, Mama, which is high and alone in the sky.”
Mama smiles and sighs and puts one of her hands on top of mine. I wish to feel her warm hand, but when I stop brushing, she snatches her eyes open.
“You have lost rhythm, Chiriqi!” she cries. “Where is discipline for you?”
My favourite time is when we must cross the bridge to get to our Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday place. This means we will see Timon with the three dogs. We are always the most early of our women, but this man is even more early. In the middle of the bridge, Timon sits on his cardboard with his blanket and his paper cup. A red dish is always full of water.
Timon’s three dogs lie around him, close and curled. When I see them, I run a little ahead of Mama. This way I can talk to Timon and his dogs before Mama and I start our art.
“Good morning, little Chiriqi,” Timon calls while I am still far from him. He waves his hand high for me to see. Because his name is Timon, that is why his dogs are named Timon One, Timon Two and Timon Three.
“Good morning, Timon,” I say loudly while I am running.
“Good morning, One and Two and Three,” I call out.
Timon Three is the one who likes me most. He is the one I want for Mama and me. His ears are brown and his face is yellow. He stands always when he sees me, and he wags his tail. Before I get close to him, he trots along the bridge to meet me. After he has licked my hands properly, and sometimes my face, Timon Three and I walk slowly along to Timon. I go with small stepping to make the walk last longer, but not so slow that Mama catches up. This is the time when Three and I belong to each other, and it is when we have our best conversation.
“Timon Three,” I say. “Again, I had a sad night.”
Three’s eyes grow dark for me.
“Who put this sadness here, Chiriqi? What is the because of this?”
“The because is Mama fought with our other women.”
“She is too fighty, maybe,” Three says. “A little bit like Timon One.”
“Is Timon One also too fighty?” I ask.
“Most yes,” Three says. “We would have no trouble in our lives if One was not so afraid of everything.”
I put my hand on Three’s fur back, and I pat him while we walk.
“Do you think my mama is afraid of everything?” I ask him.
“Most no,” he says. “I think the problem is that your mama is not afraid of enough.”
“Three,” I say. “I wish you could come and sit with us doing our art. I wish I knew how that might happen.”
Timon Three says nothing because we are close to Timon.
“Have you had a good talk with Three?” Timon says to me.
“Yes, thank you, Timon.”
When a coin comes in our cup, Mama doesn’t move. Even in the hottest heat, she stays kneeling, with her face looking down, her scarf tied tight under her chin and her hands joined flat in art-praying. She is a statue on her cardboard on the street, and I am to be part of her statue always. If I must move under my blanket, Mama won’t stop me, but later she will be angry.
“Why are you failing me, Chiriqi?” she will say. “You must never move. They are waiting for us to move even one little bit. Then they will name us as beggars.”
To show me how wrong I have been, she will spit on the floor.
Marchinn’s face is dark because I went to the toilet on my cardboard. She is angry with Mama.
“You are making this child suffer for your stupidity!”
Marchinn can shout most loud of all our women. But Timon Three is correct. Mama is not afraid of her. Even though her voice is thinner than Marchinn’s, Mama shouts and our other women look from the kitchen.
“You!” Mama shouts, pointing at Marchinn. “You! And no child and no man for you! What stupidity have you!”
Marchinn folds her arms across her chest and spreads her feet on the floor.
“Here is my warning, Rosinna. My warning and my promise. If Chiriqi ever asks me to help her, I will,” she says. “Do you hear me, Chiriqi? If you ever want me to help you, you will come to me and ask.”
Mama’s eyes have never been so black and shiny and staring at me. Under these eyes, there is no answer for Marchinn. There is not even a look that I can give. Now talking to Marchinn will not be allowed for a long time. This is the most sad night. I wish Mama was afraid of more things.
Suddenly, winter comes. Our cardboards are stiff with white and my face is pinch-pinch by the cold.
“I wish for summer,” I say to Mama. “Here is hard for winter.”
“Yes, Chiriqi,” Mama says. “But winter is most needed to see summer, just as hungry is most needed to see foods. Besides, there are harder places also.”
But I am more lonely in the winter. In the long nights, Mama is not so happy. She despises cooking our food in the same kitchen as our other women. Because Mama will not stay in a room ugly with a bulb for light, we will not wait for our women to finish, and so we must all cook together. Our other children may run through the lanes outside and fight while the food is prepared, but I must stay by Mama’s side. I am happy to be among our women and to hear them laughing and speaking. But staying so long in the kitchen, there are more mistakes I can make. If I listen for more than Mama wants, then she is angry. Also, I most wish to smile at Marchinn when a little sweet is placed in my hand and my head is rubbed, but there is never a time when Mama isn’t watching.
“Come, Chiriqi,” Mama says when our foods are ready.
When we are in our room, we sit on our mat and Mama looks to me before she eats.
“We must not mix with these beggars,” she tells me. “We are different, Chiriqi. Always remember this. We are Nahari Liske.”
Now, in these nights, I make sad mistakes being Mama’s mirror.
“What are my eyes like tonight, Chiriqi?” she asks me.
As Mama does not permit the bulbs, we have the candles in our room. These candles make Mama’s eyes black, with yellow jumps.
“Your eyes are jumping yellow in the black,” I say.
Mama pinches my arm.
“What rubbish is this?” she says. “What rubbish is this?”
In our Thursday-Friday-Saturday place, Mama takes our cardboards from behind the bin where they are hidden. She puts them in our exactly place with our cup in front of her. She folds one blanket flat on my cardboard, for my lying down, and then she covers me with another.
For half the day, I will lie on my left side. For half the day, I will lie on my right side. Mama kneels on her cardboard. She wraps a blanket around her feet, and another around her shoulders. We are most early so that no one sees our preparations. This is what Mama wants.
“This is our mystery,” she says to me every morning before she joins her hands. “This is our strength. Now close your eyes, Chiriqi, and do not move.”
The days are long and cold. I wait for the tip-tip of pigeons’ feet. Sometimes I will hear a sniffing dog. I will feel a nose close to my face. Before a voice says, “Come away,” I will open my eyelids to slits and see a dog smiling to me. All these things I will tell Timon Three.
Because of Mama’s dark eyes at the men in our old shop, we go to a different street for food. The new men try also to put Mama and me out from their shop.
“You must not be here,” they say to us, the younger man and the older one.
“You there!” the younger one says. “This is not a shop for beggars.”
I see Mama’s head raise high. I see her eyes grow black. I see her gather her spit. It is not good to spit on the floor of these men. Before we have been hit for this. But I see also, that the man must not say this exact thing to Mama. So I shout to him.
“Do not speak to Mama like this. We are not beggars. We are art. We are Nahari Liske.”
My breath is strong and fast.
The men stare at me. The younger one laughs at my words. The older one turns at him.
“Be quiet!” he says. He looks to me.
“You say big things for a small girl,” he says. Then he looks to Mama.
“You have raised a brave daughter,” he says. “You must be proud of her spirit.”
This is the correct thing to say. I see Mama swallow her spit.
“Do your shopping, Mama,” the man says. “Take your time.”
We walk around the shop. Mama is silent. She puts anchru, salt-krasts and yellow chivzt in our basket. When we pay, nobody smiles.
Outside, Mama walks quickly with our foods in our bags. I must run along beside her.
“Mama,” I say. “Mama, this is too fast for me.”
Also we are going the incorrect way for our home.
“Mama,” I tell her, running beside her. “Mama, this is not our way. This is a wrong way.”
Mama stops and turns at me. Her eyes are dark and sharp.
“What is this now, Chiriqi?” she says. “You think to tell me everything?”
I see that she is angry. She stamps her foot at me, even if this must be hurtful for her knees.
“Do you think you must speak for me?” she says. “Do you think I need a child to speak for me in this shop? Perhaps you are so proud now that you do not need your mama any more?”
Then Mama turns and walks most quickly. I run beside her and try to find her hand, but she snatches it away.
Going to our Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday place, I am very happy, but Three sees every day that I am more sad. Perhaps he tells Timon, because one morning Timon puts his head onto the side and shakes his face.
“This sadness is not good for you, Chiriqi,” he says. “But more important, when you are sad, it is not good for me or One, Two and Three. Especially Three.”
“I am sorry, Timon,” I say.
“You must find your wish, Chiriqi, and keep to your wishing.”
“Yes, Timon,” I say.
Lying under my blanket on my left side, I hear the tip-tip of pigeons. I open my eyelids to slits.
“I have a strong wishing for something,” I say to them. “Do you ever have wishing for something?”
I see their shiny black pips looking to me.
“Most yes, Chiriqi,“ they say. “We have always wishing.”
“Do you know how to make the strongest wishes?” I ask them.
“Yes, Chiriqi,” they say. “We do know. But we must not tell. You must wait for your dreaming.”
They tip-tip around me and Mama.
“Brrrgghh,” they say to me and they fluff their feathers. “Brrrgghh.”
It is difficult to make the dreaming happen. This is how I am for many nights not sleeping, but looking into the dark all around as I lie in our bed beside Mama. And so, I am awake to hear Mama crying out.
“No,” she calls. “Please. No.”
Mama doesn’t come from her sleeping, but calls out again.
“No. Please. Please.”
Perhaps she calls because it is sore for her in the knees? I think of Marchinn sleeping warm and fat in her bed. I think to go to Marchinn to ask for help for Mama and me. I remember what Mama has told me. I like Marchinn best, but it is a wrong thing to ask for help from this beggar. Marchinn . . .
A tiredness of heavy rocks is in my chest. I put my two hands on Mama’s knees, without waking her. Mama stops calling and instead she breathes kindly. Warm air leaves her mouth and stays in the dark over our bed. Also, the hot from Mama’s knees moves up through my arms and smoothes into my chest.
Soon I am dreaming that my wishing has happened. Timon Three has come to me and we are walking together always, not in cold streets but in warm grasses that are singing to us and touching us softly. In my dreaming I am happy also as I have seen that Mama is correct. Because there was most winter, now we can see summer.

Start-up ATXA Therapeutics lands €2.5m in EU funding to develop orphan drug

Company: ATXA Therapeutics
Done Deal: €2.5m funding
The clincher: “There is urgent unmet clinical need with regard to PAH, because the current drugs don’t work. They are failing patients” – Therese Kinsella, founder
Life sciences start-up ATXA Therapeutics has secured €2.5 million in funding under the EU Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Programme.
ATXA is developing novel therapeutic drugs to treat the lung and heart disease Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and related cardiovascular conditions. It was established in May 2015 following more than 20 years of research and €15 million in grant funding.
The company is led by Therese Kinsella as a spin-out of the School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science at the UCD Conway Institute.
According to Kinsella, at least US$6 million is spent worldwide each year on prescription medicines for treating PAH.
“While the condition itself is classed as a rare or orphan disease, affecting 15 to 50 patients per million of the population, it carries an enormous health burden,” she said.
“We’re targeting a novel receptor that would link to all of the clinical conditions associated with PAH, including excess thrombosis or clotting, vascular remodelling and increase pressure. There are lots of features of the disease and our drug is unique in that it will treat all of these features.”
ATXA recently secured orphan designation from the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration for its NTP42 drug.
“Securing the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Award will be a key accelerant in bringing NTP42 closer to the market by advancing the drug into clinical development. It’s really exciting that we have this novel Thromboxane receptor antagonist,” Kinsella said.
“Although PAH itself is a relatively rare condition, it is associated with a number of other widespread diseases. What we’re doing has the scope to treat much more widespread conditions. Our drug would be viewed as a platform drug, which means it doesn’t just target one condition. However in the first instance, there is also urgent unmet clinical need with regard to PAH, because the current drugs don’t work. They are failing patients and the market spend is huge.”
ATXA is seeking investment from additional sources to fund clinical trials.
“We hope to progress to clinical trials virtually immediately. The SME instrument will be the key driver that will enable us to be ready to advanced on that front,” said Kinsella.
“Within the next two years, we would hope to be advancing to first in-human phase-one clinical trials, and soon after that to phase two.”

Stop parking at Dáil on sitting days, former TDs told

Former TDs have been told to stop looking for free parking in Leinster House on Dáil sitting days due to a severe shortage of spaces.
The number of parking spaces at the front and rear of Leinster House has been reduced in recent years, most notably due to the restoration of the lawn on the Merrion Street side and the current €17 million restoration project of the 17th-century building.
But this has created competition for spaces between sitting TDs and senators and their predecessors, who have access to lifetime free parking in the Leinster House grounds.
As a result, former TDs have been told that they should not turn up in their cars between Tuesday and Thursday, when the Dáil and Seanad are sitting.
It is understood that this message has been repeatedly communicated by ushers at the gates of Leinster House – but some former TDs keep turning up for the free parking regardless.
The cost of a day’s parking in nearby city centre car parks can be as much as €36 per day.
Sinn Féin Cavan-Monaghan TD Caoimghín Ó Caoláin recently wrote to the Leinster House authorities to complain about the lack of car parking spaces. “I have had a couple of experiences of not being able to access it. I was quite vexed about it,” he said.
On some occasions, current TDs have not been able to get into the Dáil chamber on time or missed part of a committee meeting due to the shortage of spaces. Ó Caoláin has suggested creating extra parking spaces in the area on the Merrion Street side of Leinster House which is reserved for ministers and visiting dignitaries. It is currently blocked off by electronically controlled bollards.
The Oireachtas Commission, which runs Leinster House, has now sought a report on options to increase the car parking spaces in Leinster House “including proposals for the relocation of the monuments”.
That could put the focus back on the statue of Queen Victoria’s husband Albert, which occupies a spot beside a hedge on the Merrion Street side of Leinster House.
The Oireachtas Petitions Committee recently rejected a call from the member of the public to remove it on the grounds that it was a symbol of British rule. The committee was told the statue was not owned by the Oireachtas, so it had no power to remove it.
While some former TDs and senators rarely take advantage of their free parking, there is a noticeable increase in demand around Christmas time when former members come to Dublin to do their Christmas shopping.

Commercial agent CBRE is pleased with the strong response it has received to its recent launch of 47-48 O’Connell Street, an ideally located four-storey over-basement property situated on O’Connell Street between O’Connell Bridge and Henry Street.
The agent is quoting in the region of €8 million for the premises, which equates to a net initial yield of 5.51 per cent and which is occupied by Schuh at an annual rent of some €480,000.
The property extends to 907 square metres and is let to Schuh (Ire) Ltd on a 25-year FRI lease from July 2000. The lease has more than seven years unexpired and incorporates five-yearly, upward-only rent reviews.
International footwear retailer, Schuh, operates 118 stores across Britain and Ireland. There are ten stores in the Republic of Ireland including six in Dublin.
The property is located on the western side of O’Connell Street close to the Henry Street junction, one of Ireland’s premier retail locations.
[caption id="attachment_417277" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Footwear store Schuh occupies 47-48 O’Connell Street[/caption]
Henry Street has a strong and growing footfall of 30 million people per year and is home to the Ilac and Jervis Shopping Centres, the GPO Arcade and Arnotts department store as well as a host of international retailers.
One of Dublin’s oldest thoroughfares, O’Connell Street attracts a large number of tourists due to its historic significance. There are a number of historical statues and historic monuments located on the street, including the Spire and the O’Connell Monument.
The broad, tree-lined avenue is best known for being the scene of the 1916 Rising and the area has recently undergone a significant upgrade for the centenary, including an upgrade to the GPO building.
Number 47-48 O’Connell Street is well connected by public transport including Dublin Bus, Luas Red Line, Luas Cross City and Dart. The recent opening of the Luas Cross City has boosted the connectivity and pedestrian flow between north and south city and has further connected O’Connell Street to the north suburbs.
The O’Connell Street area is continuously evolving with new infrastructure and developments including the planned re-development of the former Clerys department store and the re-development of the Dublin Central site, which is owned by shopping centre specialist Hammerson.
The Selfridges Group, which owns and operates Arnotts, has also recently announced a €10 million re-fit of their store, which shows significant confidence in the future of the area as an established retail destination.
According to the agent: “There has been a strong level of interest from both private investors and smaller funds, who see the advances on the street in recent years and appreciate the potential for future growth with the arrival of the Luas and numerous expected developments, both on O’Connell Street and the surrounding area.”

Sykes set for major display of work in Venice

Twenty years after she made her first acrylic piece for her father’s 60th birthday, artist Sasha Sykes is preparing to exhibit in Venice at the Italian city’s Biennale of Architecture.
Sykes combines acrylics and resins with natural materials like flowers and foliage to make functional artwork ranging from bookends to desks, and folding and panelled screens.
At the Biennale of Architecture, her work will be on show at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini cultural centre as part of a group exhibition organised by the Swiss-based Michelangelo Foundation.
In October, Sykes will show a 40-panel seaweed screen, made with more than 200kg of hand-cast resin, in conjunction with the Peter Petrou Gallery at the London design fair PAD.
She originally studied architecture, and worked in retail design in London before setting up the furniture company, Farm21, in Ireland in 2001.
“For my dad’s 60th birthday, I made a perspex cube filled with straw to represent his farming life and I realised there was a gap in the market for contemporary rural furniture,” she said. “As the business evolved, I found I was doing more commission- and art-based work, so now I trade under my own name.”
Sykes worked in Tullow in Co Carlow for ten years, before moving to a new studio in Rathmines in Dublin 18 months ago.
“Sometimes we are working on a series that will go into a gallery, like the Caliology series of birds’ nests that exhibited through the Oliver Sears Gallery,” she says. “Other times we work to commission, designing something specific for a space. We made a reception desk for the INMO’s recently refurbished Richmond Building on North Brunswick Street.”
Sykes’ work costs from €500 for small pieces, and she sells internationally with clients in Britain, the US, Singapore and Lebanon.
“We do around 12 to 15 projects a year. Working with resins is time-consuming and it can be tricky, so we need to allow 12-week minimum turnarounds,” she said. “Some projects like the bigger screens can take 18 months, because we have to forage for the organic materials throughout the seasons to get exactly what we need to tell the story.”
Sykes has also collaborated with online design retailer TheGarnered.com to produce a range of resin bookends inspired by 1980s cocktail bars.

T5 launches first-look roadshow in advance of €50 million IPO

Body


T5 Oil and Gas, the Irish exploration firm led by Tullow Oil veteran Pat Plunkett, has kicked off an early-look roadshow with investors in advance of a €50 million initial public offering later this summer.
The firm is being advised by Davy Stockbrokers. It previously had been reported that the IPO would be worth in the region of €30 million, but sources said that it was now likely to be significantly higher than that figure.
The purpose of an early-look roadshow is to test investor appetite and how receptive the market is to a potential flotation.
The recent increase in oil prices, which has seen the price of crude oil climb above $80 a barrel, is likely to support a stronger valuation of the company.
News that the long-rumoured IPO is now moving into the fast lane will be a welcome development for early investors in T5, which has billed itself in the past as being in “the early stages of building a publicly listed billion-dollar African and Middle East E&P company, creating long-term value for our shareholders”.
The company’s main asset is 90 per cent of a Senegalese exploration block. It is led by Pat Plunkett, who was chairman of Tullow Oil for over a decade before moving on from the company in 2011.
T5’s news comes as analysts welcomed a landmark award of a North Sea licence in London-listed Irish prospector United Oil and Gas. In a note, Optiva Securities, which has United Oil and Gas on a ‘buy’ rating, wrote that the Crown oil discovery - which is contained in the concessions awarded to United - could be the beneficiary of technological advances.
“We believe that upon discovery in 1998, Crown would have been considered too small for development.
However, with significant advances in technology in the intervening period, we believe that Crown could be suitable for a single horizontal well development with a sub-sea completion tied back to an existing platform,” the broker wrote.
The investment house also increased its valuation for United from 13.5p per share to 15.7p on a fully diluted basis.

Highlight: Ryanair’s share price rose last week on the back of record numbers for 2018, but as it braces itself for the task of reaching agreement with the unions that it detests, its business model may well have been changed forever 
Body


In many ways, Ryanair’s 2018 financial year was a record for the company. Its profits, the airline revealed last week, hit an all-time high of €1.45 billion. The number of passengers it carried in the 12 months to the end of March climbed by ten million to 130 million. It added more flights to new destinations and countries. It took deliveries of even more aircraft.
These are staggering numbers and achievements in the cut-throat airline business. And they helped to push up Ryanair’s share price last Monday, when the results were released. However, the rally on the day has still not helped the price recover to anywhere near where it was trading late last summer: it remains about 20 per cent below what it was during those highs last August.
Partly, that reflects Ryanair’s own view that this year will be tougher. It also reflects the view that last year’s other milestone at the airline may have fundamentally changed its business model. Because, alongside all of the record financial figures, the airline was forced to accept what nobody had ever expected Ryanair under Michael O’Leary to do: recognise the right of trade unions to represent its staff.
The move last September to cancel thousands of flights, due to what Ryanair said was a rostering issue that left the airline short of pilots, has had consequences far beyond the couple of months of disruption it caused.
The short-term financial cost from compensating customers was minimal to an airline the size of Ryanair. But recognising unions could have a far more lasting financial impact.
More than any other industry, aviation has been vulnerable to industrial action. Planes can’t fly without pilots. Expensive jets sitting on tarmac at airports cost a lot of money. O’Leary, more than anyone else, knows that. And that is playing on the minds of some investors in Ryanair.
What was once unimaginable - that O’Leary would sit down and discuss pay with union officials as part of a collective bargaining process - is now a reality.
The Ryanair boss was unavailable for an interview with this newspaper last week. Nobody from the airline spoke to RTÉ on its annual results announcement either. But in a question-and-answer session with an analyst from the company’s own stockbroker at Davy, O’Leary was asked about the prospect of further disruptions to flights following stoppages in Portugal and Germany in recent months.
“The good thing about this, that I think the key thing about the recognition discussions at the moment is we’re not essentially talking about pay,” he said. “Even the unions accept that Ryanair’s pay, both for pilots and cabin crew now is ahead of the industry; in fact in many cases, ahead of their unionised competitors in those other countries. So what we’re talking about now is the anomalies of Portuguese maternity leave, which actually is inferior to Irish maternity leave. And so, the Portuguese union wants, for example, Portuguese maternity leave, but the cabin crew wants Irish maternity leave.”
According to the airline, it has so far agreed pay deals in Britain and Italy for pilots, and is currently in pay deal talks with unions representing pilots and cabin crew in other countries. The cost of the salary hikes and adding more staff as it expands its fleet of aircraft will add about €200 million to its annual wage bill. In a presentation to its investors, Ryanair said localised strikes were possible, but added that it would not surrender its low-cost base or model.
In the months since the flight cancellations, however, the unions have gained both in power and strength in their negotiations. The Irish airline pilots have still not signed off on a pay deal.
The wider issues facing European aviation may tilt the balance back in favour of Ryanair.
The surge in the cost of oil in recent weeks (following the decision by Donald Trump and the US to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal) will cost the industry heavily in the coming months, squeezing profit margins even tighter.
The demise of several airlines, notably Air Berlin, has reminded many pilots that carriers going bust is a regular occurrence. Air France has been battling all year with strikes, which cost chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac his job earlier this month when unions rejected the company’s pay rise offer. The French economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, has even warned that Air France’s very future is in doubt if it cannot get a pay deal sorted.
In that environment, the demands of pilots for extra pay and perks may be tempered, even if their skills are in demand.
As O’Leary told Stephen Furlong of Davy in the Q&A: “I think there is certainly a tightening in the market for pilots in the last 12 months. Most of that is because of uncontrolled or madcap expansion by loss-making airlines in Europe, most notably Norwegian, which is operating an unsustainable model.
“The Chinese airlines are clearly offering a very significant pay, but China is not the most attractive country to live in from a lifestyle point of view. We do not have difficulty in recruiting or attracting pilots. This year, we’ll have another 1,000-plus pilots. I think if there’s going to be a temporary shortage of pilots, you’ll see it affect more of the regional airlines and the smaller jet operators . . . pilots will move from there to the larger operators like Ryanair, like EasyJet and others.”
If Ryanair can keep its cost base intact from exploding pay demands by unions, perhaps the share price will react much more favourably in the coming months.
Ryanair told investors last week to prepare for lower profits in the current financial year because of higher staff and fuel costs. Luck, however, may be on its side. Higher oil prices tend to force weak competition to the wall and benefit Ryanair. A shake-out is already under way, as British Airways pursues Norwegian. Many people have bet against O’Leary in the past, and lost.

The jury is out on David Drumm

Length: 1500 words

Highlight: After 16 weeks of testimony and 40 witnesses called, the prosecution has wrapped up its case against the former Anglo boss 
Body


David Drumm, the former Anglo Irish Bank chief allegedly behind one of the biggest cons in the history of the state, sat in the dock with a thousand-yard stare.
His fixed gaze rallied intermittently as barrister Mary Rose Gearty wrapped up the prosecution’s case against him, in a closing speech spanning three hours.
There were stand-out phrases: “fundamentally dishonest”, “materially misleading”, “confidence trick”: terms used to describe the alleged €7.2 billion conspiracy between Anglo and Irish Life & Permanent (ILP), dating back a decade.
“If I see you visibly wilting we’ll take a break,” Gearty said by way of comfort to the jury at the beginning of her address last Thursday morning.
The trial had opened 16 long weeks earlier.
Having heard from more than 40 witnesses and trawled through board minutes, emails and “unvarnished” phone recordings between the main players at Anglo and ILP, the prosecution was now stripping back to essentials its case against Drumm.
Drumm, 51, the former chief executive of Anglo, is accused of authorising fraudulent bank transfers aimed at “dressing up” the bank’s customer deposits by making them look €7.2 billion bigger than they really were between March and September 2008, when the financial world was in meltdown.
He denies conspiring with other bank officials to create the false and misleading impression to existing and prospective investors, lenders and depositors that the bank was in better financial health than it actually was.
The three main people who Drumm is alleged to have plotted with are Denis Casey, the former boss of Irish Life & Permanent (ILP), Anglo’s finance director Willie McAteer, and John Bowe, who held a senior position on the treasury side of Anglo’s operations.
It is alleged that a series of “lightning speed” deals took place between Anglo, ILP and Irish Life Assurance (ILA) in late September 2008.
Money originating from Anglo was circulated between the three entities before landing back in the bank to allegedly create the false and misleading impression that deposits of roughly €7.2 billion from ILA, a non-bank entity, were being lodged with the bank. The jury has heard the alleged objective of the transactions was to bolster Anglo’s balance sheet with “imaginary customer deposits” which the prosecution says had no commercial substance.
Drumm has also pleaded not guilty to a second charge of false accounting on December 3, 2008, the date when Anglo’s year-end accounts were released.
“David Drumm was chief executive officer of Anglo Irish Bank at a time when that bank presented figures to the market. We say one of those figures, the customer deposits figure, was clearly a false figure,” Gearty told the jury.
It is alleged this “false account” was done deliberately and dishonestly and was preceded by months of discussions and meetings.
The jury was told that the whole purpose of accounting is to show what is happening in a company or in a bank. Instead, in December 2008, senior Anglo officials, including Drumm, had sought to hide reality at a time when he and his colleagues “knew the bank was going down the tubes”.
Gearty referred to taped phone calls between the likes of Drumm and Bowe discussing how the money would go round in a circle. She noted that one of the mechanics of the back-to-back transaction, Anglo banker Mike Darcy, at one point joked, or maybe didn’t joke, when he asked: “Do you want the answer, or the answer for the auditors?”
The prosecution said a thread going through the defence, in cross-examination, was that the banking system was under severe pressure in 2008, there was a feeling of doom and that Anglo was going down anyway.
While this may provide context, Gearty argued that the financial backdrop could not “exonerate” the actions of those who kept the bank limping along, if the transactions in question were found by the jury to be dishonest.
Explaining the ingredients of the offence, she said there was no onus on the prosecution to show that Anglo depositors or investors had suffered actual loss as a result of the conspiracy.
“It’s like if you are trying to sell snake oil, but you don’t actually sell any,” the jury heard. Nor did the prosecution have to prove that the primary motive of the alleged conspirator was to cause loss.
Instead the jury was told it must consider objectively whether there was an intention to defraud. Whether Drumm thought the scheme was honest or dishonest was irrelevant, Gearty said.
In relation to the false accounting charge, she said Drumm, as chief executive, had signed off on the year-end snapshot, which used “technical rules of accounting” to obfuscate the link between the €7.2 billion deposits and the interbank dealings with ILP. This, the jury heard, was materially misleading by any yardstick.
Comparing herself at one point to rapper Eminem going first in a head-to-head freestyle battle in the film 8 Mile, Gearty said she too had to try and anticipate in advance what defence counsel Brendan Grehan might tell the jury in his final address.
As Drumm’s legal team had not called any witnesses, their defence was not readily apparent.
Attempting to cover all bases, Gearty said it was “completely irrelevant” whether the Central Bank or Financial Regulator knew of the circular transactions before the December accounts as “they are not on trial”.
“The defence will say there is no reason to condemn these actions because of the greater goal of keeping the show on the road,” she said, raising the separate argument that necessity is not a defence in law.
And then it was Grehan’s turn to get to his feet for the defence and praise the “fine, concluding, bombastic, rousing call from the prosecution”.
He said they had thrown about the words “dishonest and fraud” until they were “blue in the face”, but nobody involved in the transactions at Anglo or ILP had ever used such terms.
“Mr Drumm has never sought to deny anything that he did in 2008 in respect of these transactions,” Grehan said, nor had he tried to hide them. In the midst of the worst financial crisis in living memory, he said his client had taken full responsibility as captain going into the storm, the jury heard.
“The one thing he can’t do is stand up and say he committed a fraud because he simply didn’t,” counsel added.
Referring to the green jersey agenda, where banks were asked to rally and help each other out during the turmoil, the jury heard that Drumm had heeded the Central Bank’s call to tog out for Ireland.
By way of context, the jury was reminded that there were previous “window dressing” deals between Anglo and ILP to brighten the half-year deposit accounts of both institutions first in March and June 2008.
These smaller transactions were technically different than the September agreement and are not deemed by the prosecution to amount to a fraud. Grehan suggested to the jury, there was an incongruity in these deals being presented as “fine and dandy” if the stated purpose of the law was to ensure the market was not misled about liquidity.
“Hindsight tells us that Anglo had problems, perhaps insurmountable ones, but in the middle of a crisis, hope springs eternal. You man the pumps to keep going,” he said.
In a bid to dispel the notion that the former Anglo chief executive had “morphed into some criminal mastermind”, Grehan told the jury: “All you could do is your best. We say David Drumm did his best.”
He argued that the mental ingredient of a crime simply wasn’t there. There was no intention on Drumm’s part to defraud anyone, nor were there any victims putting their hands up to say they had suffered losses as a result of the deposit transactions.
“What he did, and stands over, was viewed as legitimate balance sheet management,” the court heard.
“You are now all experts in banking, ladies and gentlemen,” Grehan said Friday morning, as he resumed his speech from the previous evening.
Not above channelling Hollywood himself, this time the film Wall Street, he told the jury: “We’ve all grown to understand that money never sleeps. It moves five decimal points a second, that’s how fast it moves.”
Grehan cited huge fears in the markets in 2008 with Ireland being swept up in a tsunami that had started with the collapse of sub-prime lenders in the United States. He maintained that rather than risking loss for investors and depositors Drumm had tried to save the bank to protect their interests.
Moreover, responsibility for the presentation of the December accounts fell to Anglo’s audit committee, not Drumm, Grehan argued.
By the time the allegedly false figures were published, Anglo’s board, the bank’s external auditors, the financial regulator and Pricewaterhouse Cooper, engaged by the Central Bank to take a hard look at Anglo, all knew about the transaction with ILP.
It was almost Monty Pythonesque that nobody had flagged a problem and yet, after December, it was suggested that“this man”, he said, referring to Drumm in the dock, had “committed a criminal offence”.
The jury is due to begin deliberations this week.

The people have moved on from the Ireland of the 1980s

The outcome of last Friday’s referendum marks, I hope, the beginning of the end of a particularly fraught period in Irish politics and law.
If the Eighth Amendment had never been created in 1983, the complexity of all the issues surrounding the circumstances in which a pregnancy may be ended would most likely have been reflected in a series of enactments by the Oireachtas to adapt our laws to modern realities and attitudes. Elevating those complexities to be governed by a simplistic Constitutional formula was a profound error, albeit an error made in good faith by many people.
People these days often have only a dim and fading appreciation of the circumstances that brought us to this moment. And it is as well now to call them to mind.
Ireland in the 1980s was a very different place. The state had, in 1935, criminalised contraception and family planning until, in 1973, the Supreme Court held that the law in question violated the rights of a married woman, Mary McGee, to matrimonial privacy.
An attempt in 1971 by Senator Mary Robinson to repeal the 1935 legislation was not even granted a first reading in parliament; the Catholic hierarchy condemned her bill as a “curse upon the country”.
Even then, our legislators (whom the pro-life movement has recently spent months telling us are not to be trusted) reacted very ponderously to the McGee decision.
The then taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, voted against his own government’s remedial bill in 1974. It failed. Charles Haughey, in 1979, pushed through legislation with some difficulty, restricting all forms of artificial contraception (including condoms) to married people who had obtained a doctor’s prescription for bona fide family planning purposes.
Conservative Catholic bodies campaigned to prevent any legalisation of contraception. Those bodies then coalesced and expanded into a pro-life movement which had decided to prevent any further judicial reform in the area by having a pro-life article inserted into the Constitution.
By that means, they hoped, neither the legislature nor the courts could relax in any way the total ban on abortion without a referendum.
Because of the highly competitive political balance between Garret FitzGerald’s Fine Gael and Haughey’s Fianna Fáil, the major parties were vulnerable to the pro-life movement’s disapproval on the grounds of being “soft on abortion”.
As part of FitzGerald’s modernisation of Fine Gael, one of its vice-presidencies came to be occupied by a young medical student who was a member of Young Fine Gael. In a media interview, she expressed the view that there were some limited circumstances in which she thought abortion was justified.
This brought the roof down on her. Her views were immediately disowned and she was “encouraged” to resign as a party vice-president. But the damage had been done.
The pro-life movement now had a pretext to label Fine Gael as being “soft on abortion”. To staunch the political wound, FitzGerald engaged with the idea of a pro-life amendment. Naturally Fianna Fáil followed suit and drafted the Eighth Amendment Bill. Fine Gael and Labour won the election.
Despite the clearest warnings from the newly appointed attorney general, Peter Sutherland, the Eighth Amendment was put to the people and passed in 1983.
Now Spuc (the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children) commenced a campaign to prevent bodies like students’ unions and the Dublin Well Woman centre from giving any information about the fact that abortion was available in England to women and girls in Ireland.
Spuc obtained injunctions from the High Court and Supreme Court threatening any person or body which was disseminating information or counselling any woman about her option to go to England for an abortion. The sanction they held over their defendants was imprisonment for contempt of court.
Nearly all of the older leading figures in the No side in Friday’s referendum were active supporters of the Spuc drive against information and counselling in the 1980s.
Then came the 1992 X case, which convulsed the country. The High Court, at the instance of the attorney general, handed down an injunction to a 14-year-old rape victim and her parents requiring her to return to Ireland and prohibiting them from having an abortion in England.
Most people were rightly shocked. They had been assured by the pro-life movement, back in 1983, that such an order would never be made.
On appeal to the Supreme Court, a majority held that the injunction should be lifted. But the court did not find that travel injunctions were wrong. On the contrary, the Supreme Court only held that the uncontested evidence that the pregnancy, if continued, constituted a real and substantial suicide risk for the schoolgirl made it lawful to terminate the pregnancy – whether in England or, horror of horrors, in Ireland.
The pro-life movement was outraged. Leaders immediately demanded that suicide be excluded as a ground for termination in Ireland, saying the people had never voted for that. Their supporters spread the rumour widely that the whole case had been contrived.
The liberal majority, too, had had enough. They demanded that the Constitution be amended to stop any more travel injunctions, and to stop Spuc injunctions on providing information in Ireland concerning the availability of abortion in England.
Albert Reynolds responded to the public disquiet with three separate proposals for constitutional change – the 12th, 13th and 14th Amendment bills. The people rejected the 12th Amendment bill disallowing suicide as a ground. They approved the 13th Amendment bill prohibiting travel injunctions for pregnant girls and women. And they approved the 14th Amendment bill allowing for the provision of abortion information subject to legislation.
This outcome meant the legislature should make provision for suicide as grounds for abortion in Ireland. But the “never to be trusted” legislators (including myself) never did so; it took the death of Savita Halappanavar for the highly restrictive 2013 Protection of Life in Pregnancy Act to be passed. Bertie Ahern had, in the meantime, committed to revisiting the suicide issue, but his proposals were rejected in 2002 by a combination of liberal voters and hardline anti-abortion voters.
Last Friday’s vote shows that Ireland has changed. The people, or a majority of them, have moved on from the Ireland of the 1980s in which the Catholic social conservatives still live – and would have us all still live.
A large amount of this arises from the institutional and theological obsessions of the Catholic Church with sexuality, purity, celibacy and the subordination of women.
From the 1930s encyclical Casti Connubii, which equated family planning to the “sin of Onan” and proclaimed the husband to be the naturally ordained head of the family, to Humanae Vitae in 1968, the Church has been on a self-destructive theological journey over a cliff. Ironically, John Paul II was one of the principle advocates of Humanae Vitae.
The clerical hardliners have left many, many people who aspire to be Christian behind them. The cost to the institutional Church and its standing has been enormous. Its influence on Irish society has collapsed. The signs were on it with the Marriage Equality referendum result. While social attitudes vary geographically and by age cohort, modern Ireland has moved on.
In terms of politics, things are changing too. While the pro-life campaigners insisted politicians were not to be trusted, they must now realise that the contrary is the case. The people, their elected politicians, and their duly appointed judges are to be trusted. Women are to be trusted.
Maybe some people should now ask themselves whether their own atavistic attitudes and dogmas are to be trusted. The Eighth Amendment was meant to be the ultimate bastion of moral conservatism. But its wording was so extreme as to carry with it the seed of its own destruction.
Referendums are the occasion for a simple binary choice. By making their beliefs and values subject to a simple binary judgment, the well-meaning and the zealots have repeated their mistake of 1983.
Things are not always black and white. Relativism may be a dirty word in some theological circles, but it is the coinage of politics and the antidote to absolutism.
Now I and the other legislators must use our skills to enact workable and compassionate laws. We have been entrusted with that task by the Irish people. We will not rush into laws that are ahead of the centre of political gravity.
But we have no reason to be afraid of doing what we feel to be right and just according to our own judgments now. We should reclaim that right and that duty from the long shadow of harmful absolutism in which it languished for 30 years.

The real GDPR test is still to come

The clock struck midnight on Friday and nothing really happened. The general data protection regulation (GDPR) came into force on May 25 and, after months of discussion, the date passed quietly on the regulation front.
But regulators and experts had been stressing for months that the GDPR was not about one single day. The implementation date was deliberately never referred to as a deadline because treating it as one would have lulled companies into thinking that being okay on one day was enough.
All the same, inboxes everywhere have been flooded with companies asking users to stay in touch. One particular type, however, is a cause for concern among those working in the area. Mails where businesses ask users to opt in again to communication have raised eyebrows from those working on implementation of the GDPR.
Emerald de Leeuw, chief executive of Eurocomply, told The Sunday Business Post : “That’s a huge email, those re-consent emails. In many cases that’s just illegal. For email you needed opt-in consent anyway. Basically if you don’t have that and send a re-consent email, you’re basically breaching the law because you never had the consent to begin with.”
De Leeuw has been working on the GDPR since 2012, back when the first draft was released. Beyond the questionable legality of some emails, she sees a lot of confusion from businesses about how they should be reacting.
“If people have already bought from you then you have a soft opt-in available to you, you can rely on legitimate interest so long as you meet certain criteria. That has been the law since 2002,” she said.
[caption id="attachment_417446" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Emerald de Leeuw, chief executive of Eurocomply[/caption]
“I was wondering where people are getting their advice because in many cases it’s either unnecessary or unlawful.”
This type of panicked misdirection was what the likes of de Leeuw feared as the implementation date neared. Ireland being on time introducing its implementation act has given her reason for hope.
“Some countries were a little late putting together their own implementation acts. Without the enforcement mechanism, then their authorities have no power,” she said.
“Anyone who thought that it was once May 25 rolled around is a little stupid and missing the point. It’s all about ongoing compliance and accountability, it needs to be continuous. It’s not something you tick off and move on from.”
The amount of discussion around the GDPR has, however, had an impact in terms of dulling the senses. There are even GDPR memes doing the rounds online, reflecting the number of times it is brought up in casual conversation.
Just hearing about the GDPR is irritating to many people at this stage and that results in fatigue.
Louise Kidd, head of liabilities and financial lines at AIG Ireland, said: “I’m sure many people in the workplace are sick of hearing about GDPR by now. The feeling is understandable, however, it shouldn’t take away from how genuinely important it is to get your company’s GDPR compliance right.
“There is a reason for all the GDPR hype. It’s a monumental adjustment of how companies process personal data and it should not be taken lightly given both the possible reputational and financial fall-out as a result of a breach.
“I think companies can overcome this fatigue by providing their staff with simple and straightforward training, cutting out the noise and providing the entire company with an overview of the importance of GDPR, its key elements and its real-world implications that will directly relate to their day-to-day responsibilities.”
The real-world impact is at least rousing businesses that have been slow to act. Mike Ross, commercial director at Wizuda, has seen an increase in the past few weeks in the number of companies realising they need to act.
“We’ve seen a big upsurge in business. The big thing now is that the fines are live and you’ve got to be careful about what you are doing now that the legislation is in effect,” said Ross.
“I don’t think the government ever turned down money. Everybody is waiting to see what approach the DPC (Data Protection Commissioner) is going to take. Will they be softly-softly or swinging a big stick?
“A few companies had it in the back of their minds and figured why should they spend money before they needed to. You have to be extremely careful nowadays.”
That lax approach to acting comes as no surprise to Colm Stafford, managing director of ERS. He said it could come back to bite companies that are slow to act.
“There are no excuses now. Since Friday, everybody is accountable. There are people totally unprepared and it’s going to be interesting to see what happens,” said Stafford.
“As is human nature, people leave things to the last minute. Panicking won’t solve problems. Businesses need a structured plan to know what their responsibilities are. Until you know what you are dealing with, you can’t deal with it.
“You need to audit the whole environment. Identify what you have and what you are using.”
It’s the breadth of work required that is going to test businesses late to act, according to Michael Conway, director at Renaissance.
“You’re going to see action where people keep sending mails and some of that will be sensible while some will be nonsense. Over time, as breaches occur, that’s when it starts becoming an issue,” said Conway.
“There is going to be a gradual build-up. It’s not an overnight thing. As and when breaches occur, they will be investigated thoroughly and aggressively. I expect there will be some large examples made. That will make people take it more seriously than they had before.
“Right now it’s a lot of paperwork and it’s a minefield for anyone doing any sort of marketing, but that will pick up again. From a breach point of view, you’ll gradually see that over the next six months people are going to really try and get their houses in order.”

Highlight: The young entrepreneur finds that his new parent company is less than enthused with its latest protegé

The cold shoulder
It took the usual three months to get the acquisition deal over the line. What was apparent during the process was that the company making the acquisition was not giddy with excitement about it. Those involved had a sense of reluctance about it – like it was being something they were being coerced into, rather than something they really wanted to do.
The company didn’t do anything to make me feel good about the process. From my perspective, however, it was the only game in town. I had to get the deal done, and so I nurtured it along in my customary prodding style.
Come March 2014, with my bank account almost at code level red, the deal was finally concluded. But there was no “well done” from the previous investors on saving the day at the last minute. If anything, people were a bit annoyed with me.
It was finally the day I and my small team could go into our new office space as part of the bigger company. Whatever turmoil I had faced before, this represented a new beginning. A positive step forward. Sure, I hadn’t made anything out of the deal, and I no longer owned my company, but I now had a decent paying job running something I had created.
It wasn’t the worst situation in the world. Not the best. But not the worst. It required perspective. Life was good overall.
What’s more, the new parent company had promised to help us develop and as I was still eager to see my ambition for it fulfilled, I more than welcomed the knowledge and assistance they would bring. We were going to take it to the next level together.
However, from day one the signs for the future were not great. The desks we were assigned to were a few regular cubicle desks. I wasn’t expecting a red carpet, but the new desk space had the effect of letting us know our place: Row D seats 4,5 and 6.
I suggested introducing ourselves to everyone in the parent company on the first day. They agreed and so everyone was called to cram into one of the larger meeting rooms. Once everyone was packed in like sardines I explained to everyone what we did, and passionately told everyone that I was excited to get to know everyone and learn what they did.
I remember having this idea that I would learn all the ins and outs of the overseeing company and broaden out my knowledge of the industry. Looking around at all the employees I could see they were not particularly impressed with my yarn. They had no skin in the game.
You may be wondering how this all developed like this. Well, what I noticed from early on was that the person who had actually negotiated the deal with me to acquire the company was no longer involved with the firm that had bought us.
I literally never saw him again, and because of that I felt out of place in the new environment. I felt like we had been dropped on the company and they now had to look after us, like a begrudging babysitter with no experience in babysitting. I don’t think they had a clue what to do with us. And so they generally neglected us.
All they really had to do was to support me, and make me feel comfortable. But instead of doing that, they tried to put us under a department in the company. I presume this was for budgetary reasons. I didn’t like the idea of sitting under any department. I was used to running the ship myself. What made it worse was that the various department heads were young careerists.
Every week we would sit in a boardroom and I would deliver our general updates to whatever head we were sitting under. The department heads had no sense of what we were doing. I was constantly trying to inject passion into the meetings in order to get them revved up, but they would just look at me like I had 12 heads.
Often when I suggested an idea to them they would tell me that my ideas couldn’t be carried out. That didn’t sit well, and so I decided to get a bit more aggressive in the meetings to try and push things on.
As an entrepreneur I always believed I had to make things happen no matter what the obstacle. In this new environment the approach didn’t warm them to me at all. It made them not want to help. They just saw me as a cocky royal pain in the ass.
The parent company had a tech head who appeared out of nowhere to redevelop our platform. Bear in mind we had rebuilt our platform two or three times in the past, to little or no effect. I figured if we were going to do it again, we should go for the jugular. I had a grand ambition to build a fully fledged social network.
We made some progress on building that infrastructure until the plug was pulled on it. The parent company simply didn’t want to invest properly in it. Nor, curiously, did they have any sense of how to do it.
When the parent company took over, we thought it was a good opportunity to send out a press release about our acquisition. We did that. It was not bad for the ego as it made it sound like we had been acquired for big bucks. Although we hadn’t, I was okay with people believing what they wanted to.
A few months into our time at the new company, we took a trip with them to one of the world’s largest conferences. On one night I drank too much and found myself ranting to others who had been in the company for years. The next morning I was deeply embarrassed. I realised that I was no longer my own boss and I wouldn’t last long with that schtick. After that, I made a big effort to avoid drinking with my work colleagues.
The chief executive of the parent company showed no interest in what we were doing. I had expected to have regular meetings with him. But I barely saw him and he never checked in. Come Christmas 2014, months after our acquisition, I was feeling hopeless. I asked for a meeting with him. I was revved up for this meeting. I was going to give another one of my impassioned spiels which had paid off so well beforehand.
I sat in his office and I told him matter of factly that I was upset at the roadblocks that had been put in front of me. I told him it was a disgrace how I was being treated in the new set-up and that we needed support if we were to push on. He responded that no one would back my vision for how I wanted to push things on.
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The boss of the company that had acquired us was basically saying that he didn’t believe in our platform or certainly my vision for it. I responded with ferocity, telling him that if I had made his company part with funds for it, that my vision for the future was right. I used some biting choice words.
He looked at me with a serious chief executive face that I hadn’t seen before. I was pushing my luck. I had to remember that I was no longer in charge. It was a humiliating feeling. He could have fired me right there and then for my tone.
“Watch yourself,” he said as he eyeballed me.
I admit he intimidated me. I had to think very quickly. Did I want to get fired, or did I want to hold on to the pay cheque? I backpeddled quickly, and said some niceties before exiting the meeting.
There’s not much more I can say about my time in the new company. Time began to disappear. Once I realised the company that acquired us had no interest in us, I stopped looking for leadership or direction for them and just kept my head down and tried to build it up inside the system, making little progress.
After two years I was in the ultimate rut. I had now run our platform for over ten years. I was very proud to hit that anniversary milestone, but there now seemed to be absolutely nowhere to go with it. What was worse, I had now become that person who just comes into the office, sits behind the desk, wastes time for most of the day and heads home.
I was going through yet another disastrous relationship and my drinking was not helping my mood. My biggest strength was my passion, which fuelled my creativity and successes. But I could feel that it was running low. It was a bit like losing your libido – it can feel like you’re dying on the inside.
Each year in the US I had to reapply for a visa. Using a visa lawyer was always a costly process, and the company that now owned us were not enthusiastic about supporting me in my applications. That really highlights the love they had for me. They said to me one day, “your visa application is not our responsibility”, which to me said “we don’t really care if you are here or not”.
With my back against the wall, I had to pay my visa legal fees for the right to work in the company that had acquired my company. In my second last year, I paid $20,000 out of my own pocket to stick around.
I tried to think what could I do to get out of this horrible situation. I began to think that maybe the best idea would be to quietly identify another company, and try to get them to buy us off the current parent company. I figured the parent company cared so little about our platform that they would separate with it for little or nothing, as it just represented a loss to them.
Rambling around online I found a man who was formerly the head of the world’s biggest theme parks. He agreed to meet me on a business trip to New York. I told him my whole story, and explained that we were stagnating in our surroundings.
The next day he emailed me. He said he believed we would be of value to many companies and that he would like to help us orchestrate the sale. “But are you sure the company are willing to sell?” he asked me.
At our summer party I approached the head of business affairs. Taking him aside I asked him would the parent company be open to the idea of selling us on. He said he would consult with the powers that be, and get back to me. The next day he got back in contact and told me that yes, the company would be prepared to sell us on.
I immediately set up a call between me, the parent company and the man I had met who was interested in helping us find a buyer. I was excited about the idea of moving on to a new home. I also thought that if we did another deal I would be sure to cut myself a slice of the action. I was well overdue, having made nothing in the previous acquisition deal. The call lasted an hour and went well.
The next day I was called into the office to meet the head of business development again. The parent company had had a change of heart. “So we have had a chat here. And we’ve decided we now want to hold onto to it. We no longer want to sell.”
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The parent company had shown virtually no interest in us in our two years under their roof. And now after saying yes to selling, and me identifying a route out, they had changed their mind overnight. I felt this was the worst way to treat me.
“Well listen, if that’s the case I want to be backed going forward. I want some positive energy put towards us. I want to be backed as the founder. Oh and also I want my green card application supported and paid for.” I should have got him to sign a piece of paper committing to those demands there and then. I didn’t.
A few weeks after that meeting my sidekick, who had been with me in the three or four years I’d been in New York, had a new job offer. He could see there was now no chance of development under the current regime. He left, leaving only me and one other from the team prior to acquisition.
In November 2016, Donald Trump was elected US president. My visa lawyer got in contact. “You need to press forward with your green card application now,“ she said. “There is not a minute to lose.”
“What are the application costs involved?” I asked.
“$15,000,” she replied.
My visa applications year in year out while in the US cost me a fortune. The experience was utterly heartbreaking. In my time I worked with two respected visa lawyers who fleeced me. There was no way I was paying the new fee. I couldn’t afford it. I contacted the second in command at the parent company.
“I’ve said it before. Your visa application is not our responsibility. You are here of your own volition.”
“Of my own volition! I am not here voluntarily. You are employing me to be here.”
I could go on ranting here about my experience under the roof of the parent company. But in the end they simply didn’t care whether I was there or not. They were doing their best to make me feel unwanted, and were doing a pretty good job of it.
What I am saying here is the tip of the iceberg. There were many moments in my time when I sat behind my desk, contemplating jumping up and causing a scene in protest. Many times I contemplated just walking into the chief executive’s office and quitting. I never quite built up the nerve, but I got mighty close.
Saying that, I never felt they would actually let me go. I figured that would be too much of a bad PR move for them, bearing in mind that I oversaw a team of over 200 people around the world. I figured they’d sooner hand the asset back to me than just let me go. They had hinted at that in the past.
I figured if they ever let me go, I would have too much information on their overall bad practices.
They may not have liked me, I reckoned, but they wouldn’t actually let me go. How wrong I was.

To thine own self be true: Three lessons in authentic leadership
Sunday Business Post
May 26, 2018

Length: 582 words
Byline: Post Reporter
Highlight: An authentic leader is emotionally intelligent and fully aware of their relationship with others 
Body


Ahenticity is often characterised by the famous quotation from Hamlet, in which Polonius gives the following advice to Laertes:
“This above all: to thine own self be true.
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man” – Hamlet, Act I, Scene III
While this might be wise advice to Laertes, it is not universally applicable to leadership. The simple reason is that authenticity and authentic leadership are not one and the same. Unfortunately, some leaders believe that they simply need to be true to themselves in order to be an authentic leader.
This is really only half the story. Simply being true to oneself does not recognise that authentic leadership is, at its core, a relationship with those around you.
What we need to explore is how we should build upon the foundation of authenticity to develop as authentic leaders.
The topic of authentic leadership has been around for quite a while.
It has even been referred to in the Harvard Business Review as the “gold standard for leadership”.
Without focusing too much on definitions, it’s generally agreed that authentic leaders are very self-aware and have a strong personal value system. They also lead from a position of trust and connect with others at a very personal level. Organisationally they are mission-driven and adopt a long-term perspective.
For authentic leaders, leadership is not a static ‘me and them’, a leader with followers. Rather, leadership is an ongoing relationship that requires intent and effort. Authentic leadership is about authentic relationships.
Building and maintaining these relationships requires more than just authenticity and good intent. It also requires a range of emotional intelligence skills.
With this in mind, and as a means of moving beyond just authenticity, I’d like to propose three emotional intelligence skills that leaders should continuously develop and practise if they wish to grow as authentic leaders.
1) Broaden your self-awareness beyond yourself.
Leaders need to increase their awareness of how others affect the leader’s own decision-making and emotional responses.
Take time to reflect on the external triggers that invoke an emotional response. These might be particular people, situations or topics. Ask yourself: “Are these responses serving me and others well?”
2) Develop more empathy. The key to developing greater levels of empathy is to become a better listener.
In addition to listening for facts, ask yourself, “how does this person feel about this?” Reflect back to the other person what you’ve heard them say: this clearly says to the other person “I understand you”.
3) Increase your range of emotional expression. In other words, learn to more skilfully share with others what you are feeling as well as what you are thinking.
You are doing this already because “your body never shuts up” – you are always communicating with your body language, facial expressions etc.
Being more skilful is not about acting or putting on a false image.
The leader needs to be aware of how she “shows up” as a leader every day and how this impacts on others.
So, to return to our friend Polonius, perhaps a better piece of advice might have been:
“To thine own self, and others, be true”
People will remember how you made them feel, long after they’ve forgotten what you said.

TO TRY: Villiera, Barrel Fermented Chenin Blanc, Stellenbosch, South Africa 2017, €18.50 from Marks & Spencer (91)
For years, chenin blanc from South Africa had a very modest reputation, with the large state-owned co-op KWV producing some particularly poor versions. But over the last 20 years, the South African industry has been transformed and the over-cropped, watery chenin blanc is history. This is an example of what can be done if it is treated well. Here, low yielding plants are hand-harvested, and the wine undergoes a natural ferment in expensive French oak barrels. The result is this sumptuous wine, with ripe peach notes and flickers of apricot. A dazzling reimagining of a South African stalwart at a super price.
This wine comes from the north-western US state of Washington, on a latitude level that is much closer to France’s northern Rhône and Burgundy than Californian, which is on the same latitude as Morocco and Algeria. Cool climate syrah, amazing rieslings and delicate chardonnay work well here. Happily, it is deeply unfashionable and land prices are a fraction of Napa Valley, meaning prices are a fraction of Napa wines. This is a very dense, luscious syrah with a white pepper spice and super-ripe finish: a well-priced, barbecue-ready charmer.
Winemaker Rafael Palacios enjoys an almost mystical status for his genius of resurrecting forgotten varietals and overlooked regions. Aptly so: with this wine, the vines are actually located high in sacred mountains, home to Celtic gods and Camino pilgrims. The effect of the altitude is less mystical: the height offers lower temperatures and cold nights, despite constant summer sun. This huge range of temperatures stresses the grapes, producing more complex, lean and vigorous wines. Here, it offers baked apple and light hazelnut notes, with intense freshness and acidity. With a little age, it evokes a hint of Meursault-like opulence.

Knight Frank’s new homes division is launching two new schemes in Dublin this weekend.
The first is the inaugural launch of three and four-bedroom terraced and detached homes at St Pancras on Mount Tallant Avenue in Terenure; the second is another first release of homes at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan in north Co Dublin.
St Pancras in west Dublin 6 is a development of 37 three and four-bedroom houses and 30 apartments built by Archtree Developments.
The units on offer today include four-bedroom terraced homes of 186 square metres priced from €890,000 and two types of three-bedroom houses, including terraced units of 159 square metres and detached homes of 158.2 square metres.
The three-bedroom options cost from €800,000.
Located close to all local amenities and within a short commute of Dublin city centre, the homes at St Pancras are built on a landscaped site around a communal green space.
The A3, energy efficient units are bright, modern and spacious with quality fitted kitchens and bathrooms and considered storage space. Show homes are open today from 10am to 12pm.
In north Co Dublin, in the well-established seaside town of Balbriggan, the Glenveagh Homes scheme of two, three and four-bedroom family homes at Taylor Hill on the Castle Mill Link Road will be on view this afternoon from 2pm to 4pm.
Visitors can walk through the show homes styled by House & Garden Furnishings showcasing a choice of two-bed terraced homes of 89 square metres, which are priced from €255,0000; a three-bedroom 102 square metre terraced home priced from €275,000, or from €297,500 for the three-bed 114 square metre semi-detached houses.
There are also two styles of four-bedroom homes – a semi-detached 147 square metre option costing from €350,000 or a four-bed detached house of 151 square metres, priced from €390,000.
All of the homes are A-rated and have well-proportioned gardens, two car park spaces, fitted kitchens by Gallagher Kitchens, fitted and tiled bathrooms and en suites as standard. The scheme is located some three minutes from the M1 motorway with strong bus and train links to Dublin city centre for commuters.
The development is launching officially this weekend, but has sold more than 20 houses from a marketing suite on site earlier this year.
For more details on either scheme, contact Knight Frank New Homes at 01-6342466.

Body


Presented in showhouse condition and offering 165 square metres of bright and airy accommodation over three levels, No 9 St Gabriel’s, off Johnstown Road in Cabinteely in Dublin 18, is bound to attract a high level of attention from families on the hunt for a turnkey home in this area.
The semi-detached redbrick comes with a B3 energy rating, a low maintenance south-west-facing garden and a guide price of €750,000 through selling agent REA Ed Dempsey.
No 9 was purchased by its current owners almost 20 years ago. Since then, all the bathrooms have been upgraded, a box room and the previous small bathroom have been amalgamated into one large, contemporary family bathroom, and the separate kitchen, dining room and sunroom have been re-configured into one open-plan bright family space that spans the width of the house.
No 9’s heating system was also upgraded in the last two years with a new larger boiler and zoned heating system which can be operated remotely via smartphone app. The CCTV is also accessible remotely.
The entrance hall has solid oak floors, wainscoting and understairs storage. Interconnecting reception rooms to the right include the living room, which overlooks the front of the house through a bay window. The room has pale carpets and a French sandstone fireplace with a gas insert. Double doors open to the sitting room, which has the same floors and leads through to the dining room and the kitchen.
The kitchen is set under a pitched roof punctuated by a series of roof-lights, and boasts a range of hand-painted and fitted base and wall-mounted units by Newcastle Kitchens with cream Quartz worktops and upstands, a full range of top-end integrated appliances, a breakfast bar with a solid oak worktop and an arch leading to the conservatory/dining room with doors opening to the rear garden. There’s also a plumbed utility room with the same fitted units off the kitchen.
There are three bedrooms and the enlarged family bathroom at first-floor level. The master suite, which includes a walk-in fitted dressing room and a modern, tiled en suite shower room, is at the top of the house.
Outside, the private rear garden was upgraded last year and has been laid in artificial lawn. It has a patio area and a shed, and is bound by timber fencing.
As well as the house being within easy access of shopping and recreational amenities in Cabinteely, Deansgrange is also nearby, as are Killiney, Dun Laoghaire, Dundrum, Stillorgan and Blackrock.
The area is also host to a choice of good schools and public transport facilities.
The 145 bus route runs adjacent to the property along the N11.

Upping the Ante: Alpha Centauri could spring a surprise at the Curragh

Highlight: At a generous 33/1, the physically formidable three-year-old is well worth a punt today 
Body


The sport of horseracing often reveals a deep insecurity when it comes to self-promotion, and the people who run it are arguably missing a trick in terms of sales activity.
Before Tony McCoy was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2010, the Racing Post ran an exhausting campaign to get him over the line, pushing what it saw as the best interests of the sport. Then again, as the whip-rule fiascos and the lowering of the Grand National fences show, British racing folk have long been deeply concerned about what the general public thinks of the sport. But things are different over here.
The positive stories, especially those that make racing unique, need selling. Few sports cannot go ahead without an ambulance following the participants, and jumps racing is especially dangerous, yet one in seven races at the Cheltenham Festival went to a female jockey.
Moreover, Harriet Tucker performed an amazing feat in the saddle at the Festival as she overcame a dislocated shoulder to guide Pacha Du Polder to victory in the Foxhunter Chase. Racing’s best-dressed ladies go around with muck-adorned faces.
We tend to admire defiance of time, but racing again falls short in promoting the achievements of the veterans of the game. I was reminded of a photo of John Kiely and his brother Paddy riding out two jumpers on their County Waterford gallops when the legendary trainer recorded two winners in recent days.
“I’ve been training since 1953,” Kiely told At The Races after the second of those wins. The relationship that the octogenarian enjoys with Grade One-winning chaser Carlingford Lough could have made one hell of a documentary.
Contemplate your 80-year-old grandfather routinely telling you he was going off to ride the strongest type of horse in racing in a piece of fast work and thinking nothing of it. Meanwhile, Kevin Prendergast gave up cigarettes at 50, won his first Irish 2,000 Guineas in 1976 and his second 40 years later with Awtaad.
Awtaad’s half-sister, Alghabrah, bids to give Prendergast (who turns 86 in July) another Classic victory in today’s Irish 1,000 Guineas. Jessica Harrington, at 71, probably feels like a nipper relative to Kiely and Prendergast. When she won the Gold Cup for the first time last year, she had strapping on her wrist, having broken it skiing. It prevented her from riding out for a time, she conceded with regret.
Harrington has a lively candidate for her own first Classic success in the shape of Alpha Centauri at the Curragh today. This one is a 33/1 poke, and those odds may underestimate her chance.
Clemmie, who was a confident suggestion for the English Guineas here but suffered a setback and missed the race, has had a campaign so stop-start as to render her, surprisingly, one of the supporting cast for Aidan O’Brien today. His main runner, likely by virtue of her superior fitness, is Happily – but her form is relatively limited and the Newmarket third appears to be a vulnerable favourite.
Perhaps a shock is on the cards. Alpha Centauri has been forgotten somewhat but, given her size, it would be an affront to logic were she not to train on and progress with time.
After her first victory in a two-year-old maiden, Harrington admitted: “When Alpha Centauri came to me, she weighed 530kgs, which is heavier than most of the jump horses, so I sent them back three times to weigh her again because I couldn’t believe it.”
This formidable specimen ended the juvenile campaign with a relatively tame run in a Curragh Group One, when she was favourite, and commenced the new season with an even poorer one in a Guineas trial. However, the ground was heavy on both occasions and the chances are that was all wrong for the filly, who gets her favoured conditions today.
At 33/1, it is worth gambling that Alpha Centauri can bounce back and show her true form. Should she win, Harrington’s usual routine would be a night of celebration followed by an early start to look after a string of horses that are the envy of most of her much younger rivals.
1pt each-way, Alpha Centauri in Irish 1,000 Guineas, 33/1 (scale 1-5)

Following the successful sale and leaseback of their 21,368 square metre distribution headquarters last year, the Valeo Foods Group has instructed commercial property specialist William Harvey to sell two more facilities on a similar sale-and-leaseback basis.
The first lot is 78 and 79 Broomhill Road in Tallaght in Dublin 24, for which the agent is guiding €8.7 million.
The second is Valeo’s Odlums facility at Westpoint Business Park in Mulhuddart in Dublin 15, which is guiding €2.6 million.
The Broomhill Road property is set on a large, high-profile site at the junction of Broomhill Road and Greenhills Road, next door to the new Harvey Norman store.
Unit 78 is a detached warehouse and office building that has been extended. The original warehouse has a clear internal height of 7.6 metres while the extension’s internal height is 10.2 metres.
There are six dock levellers and seven ground-level doors as well as two additional concertina-style doors. There are also two-storey offices at the front of the building.
Also detached, Unit 79 is a modern production and office building used in the production of Valeo’s Robert Roberts coffee label. The production areas have a clear internal height of 8.8 metres and the offices and staff facilities in this building are well appointed.
The overall site area is 5.9 acres and the site is zoned Regen, which allows for residential, offices, hotel/hostel, housing for older people, restaurant/cafe, health centre, education, or a petrol station, subject to planning permission.
The Odlums facility in Mulhuddart generates an annual rent of some €168,920 and is a detached light-industrial/warehouse and office facility on a gated site some 30 seconds’ drive from the N3.
The building is currently used by Valeo for packaging and storing Odlums flour.
The warehouse has a clear internal height of 8.7 metres and there are three ground-level loading access doors. The office area has one large office space, a fitted canteen, WCs, showers and locker rooms.

Varadkar told mandatory disclosure would be ‘counter-productive’

Highlight: Patient safety unit advised the then Minister for Health that a legal duty to report errors would not foster a ‘culture of open disclosure’ 
Body


The Department of Health’s patient safety unit advised Leo Varadkar that the introduction of mandatory open disclosure in the health service would be “counterproductive”.
The unit advised the then health minister that a legal duty to report should not be included in the Health Information Bill in a memo in May 2015.
The memo was released by the department in the wake of the CervicalCheck scandal, which has prompted the government to commit to making disclosure of medical mistakes mandatory.
When he was health minister, Varadkar abandoned a commitment to force doctors to admit mistakes they had made following advice from the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.
However, it has now emerged that the patient safety unit in his department also advised against mandatory disclosure six months before Holohan did.
The memo, dated May 5, 2015, stated: “There is advice that mandatory reporting could be counterproductive to the intention of the bill and the recommendation that we should be supportive of a culture of open disclosure.”
The unit’s decision to recommend against mandatory open disclosure is likely to raise uncomfortable questions for the Taoiseach. When he was health minister, Varadkar rowed back on a 2011 programme for government commitment to set up an independent patient safety authority. Instead he set up a patient safety office in his own department.
Varadkar’s U-turn on mandatory disclosure was criticised by patient safety bodies and opposition parties at the time. Critics included patient safety advocates such as Margaret Murphy, external lead for the World Health Organisation’s global group on patient safety.
Murphy told this newspaper there was an obvious need to have an impartial patient safety organisation, as opposed to one within the Department of Health.
The May 2015 memo outlined the existing HSE policy of voluntary open disclosure and listed the ways in which it could be assured the policy was being implemented.
These included Hiqa standards on compliance with open disclosure, Medical Council and Nursing and Midwifery Board guidelines and the stated policy of both the department and the HSE.
Holohan outlined his own case for opposing mandatory disclosure in a memo to Varadkar dated January 27, 2016. He said there was “no clear evidence to show that a legal requirement to openly disclose patients will make doctors and nurses more inclined to do so”.
Holohan said there was “some expert consensus opinion” that mandatory disclosure would make doctors and nurses more fearful of adverse legal consequences and therefore less likely to disclose information to patients. It is unclear what consensus Holohan was referring to at the time.

Highlight: Squeezed between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil is left enduring the tedium of a confidence and supply agreement which is proving to be far more durable than anyone expected
Body


Last Thursday afternoon in the Dáil, during a fairly mundane discussion on public sector pay, Barry Cowen made a comment under his breath that betrayed how the good old-fashioned animosity between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael has withstood the collegiality of the confidential and supply deal: “Before the Tánaiste or anyone else starts tweeting, I wish to point out I have a sore throat,” he said drily as he got to his feet to speak.
Cowen was referencing the infamous Garglegate episode of 2010 when his brother Brian, then taoiseach, was landed in trouble after a tweet by Simon Coveney suggested he was hungover while conducting an interview on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland following a party conference in Galway.
The sardonic gag brought a bit of much-needed light relief to a long, dreary afternoon in the Dáil chamber. But it was emblematic of a deeper predicament confronting Fianna Fáil: an inability to break free from its past while looking on in frustration as its more dynamic and forceful opponents, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, continue to thrive.
Squeezed between these two parties – with their new leaders, Leo Varadkar and Mary Lou McDonald, on an upward trajectory – Fianna Fáil is left enduring the tedium of a confidence and supply agreement which is proving to be far more durable than anyone expected.
The agreement was supposed to be a launchpad for the second phase of the Fianna Fáil recovery. Supporting the lame duck minority government was an opportunity to build on its performance of 44 seats at the last election, with a view to building its way back into power.
But the latest opinion poll in this newspaper gives Fianna Fáil the exact same support level, 25 per cent, that it had in the last election. Since Varadkar replaced Enda Kenny as Taoiseach, the arrangement no longer offers anything to Fianna Fáil other than being better than the alternative, which is going into an election campaign on the back foot.
Now that the abortion referendum is over, all the focus will be on when that general election will take place. The argument goes that Varadkar should seize the moment and go to the electorate while his stock is high, to face the people on his own terms rather than being forced into it by unexpected events.
The Taoiseach is on the crest of a wave, and the temptation to let it carry him through to a successful election campaign must be strong. Since day one of his leadership campaign, when he blitzed his opponent with a series of quickfire endorsements from the parliamentary party, a marked feature of his leadership is just how infallible his supporters within his own party believe him to be.
They were confident then, and remain so now, that he can secure a more definitive mandate than the one they now endure in a minority government arrangement.
That leadership battle of last summer wasn’t a cause for internal strife in the party. Instead, Varadkar and Coveney have emerged as a strong double act of Taoiseach and Tánaiste. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is a personable and authentic presence at the helm of a recovering economy while the next in line, Minister for Health Simon Harris, has come out strongly from the referendum campaign.
The CervicalCheck controversy was badly handled by both Varadkar and Harris. But widespread anger failed to put a dent in their party’s popularity according to the poll for this newspaper, which saw a two-point rise in Fine Gael’s rating to 34 per cent. The episode did spook many government TDs, however, and acted as a reminder that their popularity could be pulled from them any minute.
Going to the people while they are on a roll is tempting, and would be in keeping with Varadkar’s somewhat impulsive nature. In fact, informed speculation in Leinster House is that he is spoiling for an election. The only thing standing in his way is that he does not want to be seen to cause it. As Varadkar himself pointed out in the aftermath of last year’s snap election in Britain: “People don’t like being forced to go to the polls without good reason.”
That is why he needs to rely on others to cause it. If Sinn Féin was to put down a no confidence motion in Eoghan Murphy over his handling of the housing crisis - a decision it has held off on until after the referendum - then Fine Gael would hope that Fianna Fáil could be goaded into calling it.
For its part, Fianna Fáil is not going to fall into this trap. Some within the party fear that Varadkar will concoct a reason to force an election before legislation on abortion is passed, and put forward a campaign argument that Fianna Fáil cannot be trusted to get the legislation through.
An election is the last thing Fianna Fáil wants right now. While its TDs are fed up with the confidence and supply deal, they have become prisoners of it, unable to break out until the conditions for an election improve. And while the party searches for a change in tactics, it is finding it hard to make an impact.
“The arrangement we are in makes it difficult to be distinctive. We are half in and half out,” one senior Fianna Fáil TD observed privately last week.
Fianna Fáil has been fighting a formidable ground war and its leader Micheál Martin, a strong campaigner, has been canvassing on doorsteps in all key constituencies in recent months. It has focused on being constructive in proposing solutions to the country’s problems. But it is being outflanked by Varadkar and McDonald, who have placed a huge focus on personality, of identity over ideology, and have used social media communication techniques to far better effect.
The next few months will be crucial in determining whether Fianna Fáil can again become the party it once was. Like Barry Cowen in the Dáil chamber, it will have to find its voice.

From Under the Bed
By Seamus O’Rourke
Viking Theatre, Clontarf, Dublin
Rating: ****
Runs until June 2, then touring
‘Well, it’s too late tonight to drag the past out into the light,” Bono sings towards the end of arguably U2’s greatest ever song. Pat McPartland, one of the two elderly Co Leitrim bachelors in Seamus O’Rourke’s charming and poignant new play, would not agree. He barges into his brother Eugene’s room at 5am with some urgent questions about their troubled history, declaring: “There comes a time when you have to say to yourself - this is no life.”
If the makers of From Under the Bed ever want a snappy strapline for their posters, they might consider “Waiting for Godot meets D’Unbelievables”. Very little actually happens, but the characters’ clownish bickering is both highly amusing and shot through with dark significance. It’s a modestly presented drama that still manages to evoke an entire world of squandered opportunities and emotional stupidity.
The year is 1979. Pope John Paul II has told the young people of Ireland that “I love you”, but as Pat (Arthur Riordan) wryly notes: “He said nothing about oul’ wans like us.” Orphaned at a young age, he and the intimidatingly gruff Eugene (played by O’Rourke himself) have had a mysterious “big row” – which explains why they now socialise separately and eat their dinners from opposite sides of the pan.
The chief difference between them is that Pat has not yet given up hope of losing his virginity with a married neighbour. This prompts Eugene’s halting reminisces of his youthful failure to court the same woman, an incident that condemned him to a life of “working and dragging and scraping and hanging on”.
To put it delicately, From Under the Bed will probably best be appreciated by people of a certain age. In act two, the brothers have acquired a television set, enabling them to swap banter about Hawaii Five-0, Kojak and sexual discussions on Gay Byrne’s Late Late Show (“Some of them are going at it in the nude!”). While this new contraption gives them a window on the outside world, there are subtle hints that it might also encourage them to withdraw even further into their own private miseries.
Although they do not look much like siblings, the chemistry between O’Rourke and Riordan is a joy to watch. Dressed alternately in ancient suits and grimy long-johns, they rile, probe and occasionally even express tenderness for each other as only close relatives can. They are well served by Noel Nash’s suitably squalid set, a dusty farmhouse bedroom that has clearly remained off-limits to women for over half a century.
Directed with tasteful restraint by Bairbre Ní Chaoimh, From Under the Bed isn’t flawless by any means. It has a static structure and some of the script’s conversational detours quickly hit dead ends. Even so, O’Rourke’s deeply humane approach makes it a pleasure to spend time with these self-proclaimed “hillbillies” – and shows that even men who lead lives of quiet desperation sometimes have important things to say.

Michael Morpurgo will always be most famous for War Horse, the much-loved tearjerker that has been a bestselling book, a spectacular play and a glossy Hollywood film. According to the former British Children’s Laureate himself, however, his 2003 novel Private Peaceful is a superior story. Fans can judge for themselves when a one-man stage adaptation by Simon Reade starring Irish actor Shane O’Regan returns to the Gaiety Theatre next week.
Private Peaceful is set on the killing fields of Flanders, where an 18-year-old Tommy knows he is not long for this world. Switching between 24 different roles, he delivers a lyrical account of his rural Devon childhood, the girl who broke his heart by marrying his brother Charlie, and the military misadventures that have left both boy soldiers in mortal danger.
Private Peaceful runs at the Gaiety in Dublin from May 29 to June 2.

Was force necessary to take out Hennessy?

Highlight: It was a single bullet from one standard-issue weapon that took out suspected killer Mark Hennessy last Sunday night as he sat in the driver seat of his wife’s Nissan Qashqai
Body


Michael Staines, the first Garda Commissioner, declared that the force would “succeed not by force of arms, but on its moral authority as servants of the people”.
All very well, but times change - and so do attitudes towards policing. An upsurge in the violent gangland Hutch/Kinahan feud saw an elite Armed Support Unit hit the streets of Dublin last year.
This heavily equipped unit is small, comprised of around 55 members. The vast majority of armed gardaí are rank and file detectives carrying sidearms, such as a Sig Sauer revolver.
In a force of 16,000, approximately 3,280 gardaí are authorised to carry guns. Whether this represents a year on year or decade on decade increase in firearm capacity – a gradual arming-up of the force - could not be readily confirmed by the Garda Press Office.
But it was a single bullet from one such standard-issue weapon that took out suspected killer Mark Hennessy last Sunday night as he sat in the driver seat of his wife’s Nissan Qashqai.
A post mortem established that the 40-year-old father of two had been shot in the shoulder. The bullet entered his torso, causing fatal injuries. Other wounds consistent with self-harming were noted on his body, and a Stanley knife was found in the car.
Such fatalities are extremely rare in Ireland, and raise the spectre of the major shortcomings in the Garda operation that led to John Carthy, who had a psychiatric illness, being shot down by the emergency response unit at the siege in Abbeylara in April 2000.
A Garda may only discharge a firearm when there is a serious threat either to the Garda member or to others. Qualified members are required to complete refresher firearm training each year. They are instructed to aim for the torso, as appears to have occurred in Hennessy’s case.
Initially last week, Garda sources suggested detectives had confronted the suspect at Cherrywood industrial estate after he threatened an unarmed member of the force with the knife.
There were even suggestions of “suicide by cop”, an American concept which involves suspects deliberately behaving in a threatening fashion in the knowledge that they will be swiftly gunned down.
These accounts have now been dispelled by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (Gsoc), which is investigating the fatal shooting, by the confirmation that Hennessy was seated in the car. Six members of the watchdog are on the case, and the matter is being treated as a potential offence. A unit arrived at the scene at 11.50pm last Sunday.
While there was bound to be confusion amongst gardaí in the aftermath of such a serious operation, early reports raise questions about the response even more disquieting questions for the force about the necessity of using force in the circumstances.
It is, however, early days for this particular investigation.

Offers in excess of €700,000 are being sought for a generous warehouse on an equally large site at the Dunkettle roundabout in Glanmire, Co Cork.
The detached warehouse includes a workshop, offices, WC and shower facilities as well as a canteen within some 1,023 square metres, all set on a 1.5 acre site.
“Due to the size of the site, the property could easily be expanded by an occupier if required,” said selling agent Declan Hickey of Casey & Kingston Auctioneers in Cork.
“The location is ideal for any business looking to be within easy access of all the main roads around the city and it is rare that this type of building, with a good quality warehouse on a large site, comes on the market. With its excellent location we expect it to be of interest to wide sectors of the market.”
The site is located next to the busy interchange and has access to the N25 Waterford Road, the M8 Dublin Road and the N40 South Ring Road.
It includes an open storage area with a concrete/tarmac finish, which is enclosed with a palisade fence for the most part.
The property comprises a detached, steel-frame warehouse with a first-floor mezzanine storage area. It has two roller-shutter doors and six-metre eaves.

Workers face losing €1.3bn in tax relief on pensions

Body


Workers are facing a double threat to the €1.3 billion-worth of annual tax relief on their pension contributions.
The Department of Finance has set up a working group to examine the scrapping of the higher pension tax relief of 40 per cent and replacing it with the standard 20 per cent band.
Separately, it is also planning to cut pension tax reliefs for private sector workers to fund the state’s new “automatic sign-up” pension scheme.
The strategy is outlined in the government’s recently published pensions reform roadmap, which has committed to bringing in the new pension scheme by 2022 for the 50 per cent of private sector workers who have no pension cover.
The state is planning to contribute €1 for every €2 that is put in by a worker and a further €2 from an employer - but it will recoup the cost from workers’ existing pension tax reliefs.
“Any contributions made by the state will replace, rather than augment, existing tax reliefs,” the strategy said.
Fianna Fáil social protection spokesman Willie O’Dea expressed concern that cutting pension tax reliefs would reduce the already low level of private sector workers with a pension.
“By reducing the tax relief, you’re making it much less attractive, particularly for middle-income workers,” he said.
Last week, the ESRI think tank suggested cutting the 40 per cent tax relief on the grounds that higher earners were gaining the most from the current system.
It said that reducing it to the standard 20 per cent rate would save €1 billion and equalise the benefits “as richer households lose more than poorer households”.
The Department of Finance has confirmed that it has set up a working group to examine the fairness of the pension tax relief, comprising representatives from the Revenue, the Pensions Authority, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure.
Irish Association of Pension Funds chief executive Jerry Moriarty said that people were getting the pension tax relief on their contributions – and then paying tax on the pensions that they got upon retirement.
He went on to say that decreasing these reliefs would hit people in the pocket.
“It just means overall it is going to cost people more and you are going to have reductions in take-home pay as a result,” he said.
Moriarty also warned that reducing pension tax reliefs could also affect public sector workers, who are currently able to claim tax relief on their pension levy.
“You end up reducing their take-home pay because they are no longer getting tax relief,” he said.
The Department of Finance confirmed that one of the actions being examined by the interdepartmental pensions reform and taxation working group was “an evaluation of equity in the distribution of tax expenditure on pensions”.

Yes campaign outspent No by more than two to one

Length: 484 words

Highlight: Total amount spent by both sides in the campaign will be clear when electoral watchdog Sipo releases its report later this year 
Body


The pro-choice campaign Together For Yes has said that it raised and spent €1.5 million in its bid to repeal the Eighth Amendment.
This was significantly more than the main No campaign group, Save The 8th, which said that it raised and spent around €650,000.
The total amount spent by organisations in the referendum campaign will be not clear until the electoral watchdog Sipo produces its spending report later this year.
However, the report will not take account of what many campaigners believe was a considerable advertising spend on Facebook, Google and other online platforms by organisations not registered with Sipo.
There have been widespread calls for the overhaul of campaign finance laws during this referendum campaign, due to the growing influence of unregulated online advertising.
Google took the controversial decision to implement a total ban on all referendum-related advertising a fortnight ago, after Facebook banned referendum ads paid for by organisations outside the state.
However, the Transparent Referendum Initiative, which analysed referendum ads from both sides, reported last week that neither ban had worked, with untraceable Google and Facebook ads still appearing. In addition, it said that a minority of organisations advertising online had actually registered with Sipo.
“Even after the attempts at self-regulation by Google and Facebook, we’re still seeing money being spent to target Irish voters online,” TRI co-founder Liz Carolan said.
“In many cases, the location, identity and intent of advertisers remain unknown. It is then up to our government to make sure that the rules governing finance in our elections cover digital spending.”
UCC political scientist Dr Theresa Reidy said the referendum campaign had demonstrated the need for reform.
“Our campaign regulation laws are hopelessly out of date, and no longer serve voters. They were drafted in the pre-internet era, and need to be updated immediately,” she said.
Together For Yes was the main civic society group campaigning for a Yes vote. It ran a number of crowd-funding initiatives which, it said, raised a total of €1.58 million during the course of the campaign.
Of this sum, €631,000 was spent on advertising and posters; €155,000 on leaflets; €181,000 on digital and social media; €116,000 on “mobilisation”; nearly €100,000 on branding; €71,000 on communications, website and training; €161,000 on consultancy, rent and office costs; and €168,000 on merchandise.
Save The 8th, the main campaign group against repealing the Eighth Amendment, could provide only a rough breakdown of where it spent the €650,000 or so that it raised during the campaign. It said that around €125,000 was spent on staffing, rent and office costs, while roughly €250,000 was spent on posters and billboards. Around €100,000 went on online advertising and other costs, with €150,000 on newspaper ads and around €50,000 on leaflets.

Yew Grove scales back size of IPO

Body


Yew Grove, which plans to become Ireland’s newest publicly quoted property investor, has scaled back the size of its initial public offering.
The company, which is being promoted by Investec on behalf of London-based Parapet Capital Advisors, had planned to raise around €100 million. However, it is thought that the final war chest raised may now be closer to €80 million.
The fund, which plans to list on the Enterprise Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) and the AIM in London, will structure itself under the Reit (real estate investment trust) legislation. This means it must secure a full listing on the ISE within three years of flotation.
The company has secured around €60 million in commitments from a variety of investors, including Dutch, Irish and British backers. Market sources said that additional commitments in the region of €5 million had been secured after meeting with dozens of Irish investors in recent days.
It is anticipated the fund will close in the middle of next week, with an IPO planned for early June, once the bank holiday is over. The company has ditched some of the aggressive strategies employed by other Reits that have floated in Ireland in recent years, and will eschew the generous founder share schemes that executives at other plcs have enjoyed.
The executive team will only pay themselves 50 per cent of their full salaries until the Reit hits certain performance targets.
It is also not looking for investment from hedge funds, preferring backers who have a longer investment timeline.

‘Grilling’ of Zuckerberg turned into a lukewarm going-over

Body


Mark Zuckerberg couldn’t have asked for an easier ride than the one he got in the European Parliament last week. The convoluted format of the encounter played right into the hands of a man who will happily give apologies and avoid addressing concrete issues around Facebook’s steps to change.
While the Oireachtas committee in April was able to directly ask questions of Facebook number two John Kaplan, much as the US house committee had of Zuckerberg, the European Parliament’s approach was an utter mess.
All the groups in the parliament submitted their questions, all of them were read out, and only then did Zuckerberg start answering. There was no interrogation, no room for the questioner to seek more detail because it was all part of one pile.
Zuckerberg’s response was far from satisfying. He pointed to the moves made here in Ireland and in Canada, but he wasn’t challenged on the efficacy of said initiatives.
The referendum campaign that has just ended was at the core of the discussion and it was clear to anyone with a Facebook account that the moves made by the social media giant were far from comprehensive. Holes remain in the armour, yet Zuckerberg was able to deflect the potential damage to democracy by focusing squarely on the positives.
The worst part of all of this was that Facebook didn’t choose the structure of the questioning. It was the parliament’s own call to have Zuckerberg’s appearance before it conducted in such a farcical manner.
His appearance, therefore, seemed to be more about ensuring a press conference for parliament president Antonio Tajani alongside Zuckerberg – one which, understandably, got more attention after the non-grilling from the other members – than actually getting any answers.
Nice as it is to be able to say our own elected officials did a better job grilling Facebook than the rest of the continent combined, petty local victories are nothing to smile about when there are real concerns about the integrity of democracy in play.
The month since that Oireachtas grilling saw the rollout of tools by Facebook designed to prevent external interference in voting. The European Parliament had a real chance to quiz the boss of Facebook about how efficient those tools are at doing what the business claims they do. It was a chance to demand something real from Facebook in terms of delivery.
Instead we got an opportunity for more memes of Zuckerberg, a few platitudes about how everything is on the right track, and nothing in the way of answers.
The headlines have been about how Zuckerberg’s performance frustrated MEPs, yet it was their own structure that gave him the means to do just that.
With the dust settling on the referendum here, the intense focus on what we expect from Facebook will die down. That’s exactly what the social network needs – for the heat to die down. The European Parliament had an opportunity to crank it up once more last week and failed miserably.

Body


A real house of two halves - laid out over three floors, and boasting stunning sea views which rival those along the Italian coast after which is it named - is Amalfi, a 319 square metre residence on Sorrento Road in Dalkey, south Co Dublin.
On the market with Colliers International at €2.4 million, the distinct residence rests on almost half an acre of lush, sloped private gardens cut into Killiney Hill and close to the junction of Sorrento Road and Vico Road.
One half of the residence was built in the 1930s, the other was added in the 1960s and modernised again in the 1990s, and was designed to enjoy the enviable sea views from its tiered, elevated site, gardens and terraces.
A leafy, stone wall-bound driveway leads to the entrance steps and up to the front door. The light-filled hall is characterised by a spiral staircase leading to the first floor.
To the left of the hall is a dual-aspect living room – or study – with a fireplace. To the left of the hall is a large double bedroom and en suite bathroom.
The main living accommodation is at first-floor level, along with more impressive sea views, and includes another living room, which has access to a terrace, an oval, formal dining room and study which all take full advantage of the views across the bay.
The kitchen, breakfast room and sunroom overlook the mature rear gardens. The second double bedroom and en suite are also at this level, as well as a utility room. The master suite at the top of the house boasts panoramic sea views and comes with a dressing room and an en suite with a full bathroom suite.
Also on the grounds is a detached studio which could be converted to a separate private garden suite or separate accommodation, subject to the necessary planning permission. While it ticks a number of significant boxes, Amalfi has a G energy rating and would benefit from further modernisation.
The prized location is within short walking distance of Dalkey village and its host of amenities, including schools, shops, eateries, Dublin Bus and Dart services.
The area also offers scenic walks along Killiney and Dalkey Hill. Dublin city is approximately nine miles away and the M50 is a short drive away, providing ease of access to Dublin International Airport.

Agility has a PR problem – and it urgently needs to be fixed
Sunday Business Post

Length: 852 words

Highlight: It’s been around for a while as an organisational competency, but the concept of agility is often inconsistently defined and unevenly executed 
Body


Leading, working and performing in a more complex environment and at an ever-increasing pace are among our biggest challenges today. Disruption and continuous change are now ‘normal’ and expected in most industries.
But this is not necessarily new. In fact it has been going on for some time. So how are we managing this increased complexity and pace, and what seems to be working for those who have led the way?
Organisational agility is well established as one of those critical competencies that has helped organisations successfully adapt to a more complex and rapidly changing business environment. For high-profile cases, just look at what Netflix and Amazon have done with their business models over the last ten years.
Research has established that agility is also a quality which will future-proof organisations and employees, and help them to meet future challenges and opportunities.
Many business writers and researchers such as McCann and Selsky have identified agility at organisational, team and individual level as the most common and necessary quality in dealing with “rapid and turbulent change”.
The basic and compelling argument is that if business leaders can improve an organisation’s agility and build it into the organisational culture, structure and processes, they will have gone a long way towards dealing with the ‘complexity challenge’, and towards preparing their organisation for the business challenges and opportunities of the future. So far, so good.
While agility has been around for ever one way or another, more modern agile principles and practices to fit today’s context have been developing in areas like software design and product development in recent years. These principles and practices have now begun to spread into the wider business world.
But there is a problem. As a deliberate organisation-wide strategy and competency, agility is often inconsistently defined and unevenly executed.
Bill Joiner neatly captures the multifaceted elements of agility with one definition among many that exist out there: “Agility is acting with purpose and flexibility, collaborating with disparate stakeholders, developing creative solutions to complex problems, continually learning and changing”. However, many leaders and employees struggle to agree on what this actually means for them and their organisation, let alone how deep it should go or how it should be implemented and managed.
There can also be a healthy conflict or tension between the practical consequences of agile mindsets and principles compared to the traditional command and control cultures and more comfortable ways of working of the past.
McKinsey and others also fairly point out that you can’t have agility without stability, thus prompting the question among leaders of where and how to strike that important balance in their organisation.
These are some of the reasons why making real progress on agility has remained in the “want to have but hard to do” category, with more pressing short-term challenges often remaining higher up the priority list.
The important question is what does agility really mean and look like for your organisation, your leaders and your employees – and how can it be delivered appropriately at organisational, team and individual level in your specific context and situation.
As well as leaders conducting a structured, high level and honest scan of agility for their organisation, one of the early places to start is with leaders themselves, helping them think through how agile they are as leaders and what impact this is having on the wider organisation.
In their book Leadership Agility (Jossey-Bass, 2006) and subsequent research, Joiner and Joseph define the natural and progressive development stages of the “agile leader”.
From the tactical and problem-solving orientation of the “expert leader” to the more strategic and outcome oriented “achiever leader” and then the more visionary and facilitative/empowering “catalyst leader”, Joiner and Joseph describe the practical skills of progressively leading in a more agile way.
This helps to clarify and call out typical leadership development stages through the lens and language of agile principles and practices. Such self-awareness and clarity of language and behaviour are important requirements for any organisation seeking to be more deliberate and mindful in developing genuine organisational agility.
“Leading in a more complex and rapidly changing work landscape will remain one of the most important organisational, leadership and personal challenges into the future. Agility is one of the more compelling solutions to leading this future, but it needs some help with its definition and image!”
With input and support from the leading international experts in their fields, the IMI Senior Executive Programme sets out to support senior leaders in exploring and forging their own “next practice” in strategically leading their organisations, their employees and themselves through this evolving environment.

Headline furniture in Mealy’s two-day sale starts with a Victorian yew-wood and marquetry Killarney table, the circular top decorated with shamrocks, roses and thistles (€8,000-€12,000). Two outstanding continental highlights are an elegant French marquetry and parquetry centre table inlaid with musical trophies and foliage (€3,500-€4,000), and a late 17th, early 18th century Dutch walnut and brass-mounted cupboard on chest (€3,500-€5,500).
A grand 19th-century brass bed with impeccable provenance has the conservative estimate of €700-€1,500. Originally from Cashel Palace, built to house Irish archbishops but sold by the Church in 1959 to Lord Brockett who opened it as a hotel in 1962. The 19th-century fashion for metal beds was in part due to hygienic concerns. Unlike timber, metal was believed to be unable to harbour typhoid germs. The rich chose brass, the poor made do with iron.
“Irish hands and Irish materials in the making of beautiful things” was how the Dun Emer Guild prospectus described its wares when set up by Evelyn Gleeson in 1902 to promote arts and crafts – with a focus on the new Irish identity. By the 1920s the most popular pieces were those featuring Celtic motifs and the sale has two good wool carpet examples, circa 1930-40, one with a lime green background (€1,500-€2,500), a second on terracotta (€2,000-€3,000).
Provincial silver highlights include two soup ladles, one bright cut by William Fitzgerald of Limerick, circa 1800 (€3,500-€4,500), a second by Carden Terry of Cork, circa 1780 (€1,500-€2,000). The most decorative piece, also 1780, is a pedestal sugar bowl by Carden Terry (€2,000-€3,000).
Exceptional pieces of stained glass are a five-panel stained and leaded glass window in a pitch pine frame, 153×236cm (€6,000-€7,000), and an Art Nouveau stained and leaded glass window, 123×180cm (€2,000-€2,500).
Leading Chinese lots are a lacquered six-fold, lavishly decorated screen (€5,000-€6,000), and a bronze group modelled as Guanyin, Bodhisattva of Compassion, seated on a temple lion (€2,000-€3,000).
Rarely seen these days is a splendid example of the art of cut paper, Portrait of Jonathan Swift by Nathanial Bermingham, executed in 1774, the year before Swift’s death (€3,500-€5,500). Swift mentions cut paperwork in his Miscellanies, “Clarissa drew her scissors from the case, to draw the lines of poor Dan Jackson’s face. One sloping line cut forehead, nose and chin. A nick produced a mouth and made him grin.”
One for the dedicated collector might be Ivan Sutton’s depiction of an auction under way at Mullen’s, Laurel Park, In Full Flow, 39×49cm (€1,200-€1,800).
Sporting lots range from a collection of Manchester United Official Match programmes (€40-€60), to the 1922 GAA medal from Intercounty Cavan V Meath, won by J Mackeon of Cavan (€450-€550).

Highlight: Tough challenges abound for Greencore’s management. Shareholder patience may endure for the moment, but not indefinitely 
Body


Not long ago, Greencore was one of the darlings of the stock market, after a real turnaround in its fortunes under the leadership of Patrick Coveney.
The company gained its place in the Ftse 250 nearly five years ago now. Its management’s proactive focus on operational excellence, innovation and a progressive series of bite-sized acquisitions in Britain and the US had served shareholders quite well. Its British business has been firing on all cylinders since then, and its grip on its chosen segments in the food-to-go space has continued to endure (although the beginning of a consolidation in food retailing among Greencore’s British customers can’t be good news for the company).
But it is in the US that Irish companies have historically come a cropper with their expansion plans. Following Greencore’s jumbo $747 million acquisition of Peacock Foods two years ago, it now appears to have been struck by the same misfortune.
It dipped its first toe into the US market with the acquisition of Home Made Brand Foods in 2008. This was followed by many modestly sized bolt-ons. It was just about approaching profitability in the US when the opportunity for a quantum leap presented itself: the chance to buy Peacock Foods with a price tag of $747.5 million. That sum was more than the combined cost of all Greencore’s US acquisitions over the previous eight years.
The acquisition was financed by a mix of debt ($250 million) and £439 million of equity raised from a 9 for 13 rights issue at a then heavily discounted price to the market. The rights issue was well subscribed, and was followed by much hype about the intended “transformative” acquisition in a market where Greencore had failed to turn any material consolidated profit from its previous eight US investments. That’s why management did what management often does in these situations - making a significant add-on acquisition.
But, by definition, that add-on came at a price: a leap in the financial gearing of the group – albeit at what still appeared an acceptable level, provided the fortunes of the US business could be turned around within a reasonable timescale.
But Peacock has not delivered as planned. And these American woes have seen Greencore’s share price tumble to a point where, up to the middle of last week, the fallout it in performance terms in the bottom 10 per cent of the 243 members of the Ftse 250. That’s a dangerous place to be.
Greencore’s falling stock market value was, by then, on a par with two other highly troubled Ftse 250 companies - pet shop retailing chain Pets At Home and the British outsourcing group Mitie. At the very least, this must have been a big embarrassment for Greencore management, given the scale of the jumbo rights issue less than two years ago, and its hugely dilutive impact when shareholders were called upon to “pony up” for shares at a 32 per cent discount to the market price prior to the announcement.
Last week, the shares were down by more than 25 per cent from the previous 12-month peak, with shareholders clearly deciding that Peacock was far from a compelling investment proposition.
Aside from the overhang of the rights issue, the perception of Peacock has not been enhanced by the recognition that it is a very different operation from Greencore’s food-to-go business. It is, fundamentally, a contract manufacturing business for the all-powerful branded food companies.
The market initially did not appear to focus on that key difference between Peacock and Greencore’s higher quality food-to-go business in Britain, where the company delivers for its major retail supermarket customers a higher value added, higher margin offering. That offering has far more considerations than just price and delivery weighing on the buying decision. Peacock’s contract manufacturing relationships involve less value added. This narrower added value offering in the US, compared to Britain, makes the competitive and margin threat somewhat greater.
This appeared to be quickly perceived by the market and, following the Peacock acquisition, the Greencore share price moved quickly downward. Last week, it was at half its 2016 peak.
The relentless slide in the shares over several months unnerved investors, and it took management a long time to issue a profit warning. When it did come, it was out of the blue as far as many shareholders were concerned. But to hedge funds, it certainly didn’t come as a surprise, as they began shorting the shares in big dollops shortly after the Peacock acquisition.
Only those close to the US operations had a decent chance of sniffing the way the wind was blowing. The shorters were pouncing in abundance and the company was, at one stage, the most shorted stock in the Ftse 250.
Clearly, the scale of the shorting suggested that hedge funds who were players in the market had greater insight than the market as a whole. Indeed, companies like Greencore, with a very small number of big customers, are especially vulnerable to short sellers who have access to market intelligence on just one or two of the company’s major or prospective customers.
Given that neither Greencore nor Peacock has much more than a dozen direct major customers, it can’t be too difficult for professional short sellers to go digging and find one or two examples of key customer attrition which, once known, will probably hammer the share price unless and until they are replaced.
That aside, the business has high operational leverage. So the volume declines as a result of even one major customer departing can play havoc with trading performance and the share price - from which professional short sellers and hedge funds profit handsomely.
In any case, there are many other material risks facing Greencore which justify its modest stock market valuation of little more than almost a sub-teen multiple of projected earnings. The valuation clearly reflects serious market doubts about not just the the quality of the new US earnings, but also the concentrated nature of the customers who drive them, their negotiating muscle and their potential attrition rate.
However, in the second half of last week, Greencore management seemed confident enough to assure the market that no further contract losses were in the offing, and the share price recovered to the pre-profit warning level.
That is good news, if it holds, because in the absence of a recovery from what has been a serious setback, a question mark can be justifiably placed over the morale and the staying power of Greencore’s close-knit top management team, all former McKinsey consultants, who currently occupy the positions of chief executive, finance director and chief operating officer.
Tying them in could now be problematic, because the recent trading performance diminishes, if not eliminates, the bonus potential in the near term. And after the sharp falls in the share price over the past year, the value of management’s stock options has been hammered.
In those circumstances, the incentive for management to stick with it will certainly be placed in doubt. People with the experience of Coveney, his finance director and his chief operating officer should be easy prey for the headhunters. Their reputation overall comes from better times in the past, both at Greencore and in the world of blue-chip consulting at the highest corporate levels. Profitable share option exercises and the questionable prospect of bonuses in the near future could tempt more than one of them to jump ship.
As for the future, one topic not mentioned in the results announcement last week was the potential impact of Brexit on the company’s British business. Last year, before trouble started brewing on other fronts, Coveney was quite forthright on Brexit and how it would present serious challenges. These challenges are likely to be around the supply chain, raw material input costs and the availability of relatively low-cost labour as Britain’s borders become less open and more challenging in terms of sourcing workers.
Against this background, as well as the serial US disappointments and the costs of the reorganisation of the business Stateside, it is hardly surprising that the valuation of Greencore is still far down from its peak.
There is far too much that can go wrong, and far too little certainty on whether the right sizing and rationalisation of the existing and acquired manufacturing plants will materially change the underlying dynamics for the company.
For Greencore, its management and its shareholders, the next 18 months or so will be a nerve-racking time. A full recovery will be challenging and hard-won. Management has a year to show it can be done.

Cork-based KM Medical Software is set to open a London office to target the British market ahead of plans to raise €2.5 million in interim funding this year. The company closed a €500,000 seed funding round in 2017, with sources including private investors and state agency Enterprise Ireland.
KM Medical sells web-based software to the healthcare sector, including electronic medical records for physicians and surgeons, and clinical outcome software for studies in areas like gynaecology and oncology.
The company sells five software products to doctors, clinics and hospitals under the iMedDoc brand. The products can be used for practice management, hospital billing, clinical research and handling patient relationships.
KM recently signed a deal with the Sports Surgery Clinic in Dublin. “The Mater Private in Cork is also deploying our software to manage its outpatients,” said Andrew O’Donoghue, who joined KM in 2016 as chief executive. “That means consent forms signed on an iPad and dictation done on smartphones goes straight into a patient record. The Mater Cork will even be scanning implant serial numbers using the iPhone to record the serial to the patient’s file.”
KM Medical sells directly to 700 customers in Ireland, Britain, the US and Australasia. “We grew by 50 per cent last year, which is great, but it’s brought home the realisation that we need to scale to meet demand quickly,” said O’Donoghue. “We’re about to embark on an interim fundraise after last year’s seed round and will shortly recruit for five new technical roles in Cork and Dublin.”
The firm was founded in 2007 in Cork by Indian-born orthopaedic surgeon Maha Lingham. “When he couldn’t find any software that he could use in his own practice, he recruited a couple of engineers and made his own,” said O’Donoghue.
“Other consultants started asking if they could buy the software, and Maha and his wife Mary launched KM.”
KM Medical employs 12 people in Ireland and more than 40 in Coimbatore in India. O’Donoghue said the company’s new London office would be used to target both NHS Trusts and private hospitals in Britain.
“We’ve just signed a large hospital group in Ireland to use our codified pathways software iMedCP,” he said. “It manages the clinical pathway of patients through a hospital using algorithms the platform has learned from clinicians. It’s the first deployment of our medtech AI platform. Our London office will focus on getting new business specifically for that platform and our research software.”
KM Medical is a High Potential Start-up (HPSU) client of state agency Enterprise Ireland.
“They invested €150,000 last year and are an equity holder, but their non-financial support is just as important to us,” said O’Donoghue. “Their sessions on topics like exporting and sales are enormously useful and access to the HPSU Founders Forum is a chance to connect and learn from other growing start-ups.”

Highlight: This semi-detached home with its vaulted ceilings, oak floors and exceptional fittings is a short walk from one of south Dublin’s most beautiful villages  
Body


Located in one of south Co Dublin’s most sought-after areas, Glendower at 24 Castlepark Road in Dalkey barely resembles its former 1920s self, having been completely renovated and upgraded - or what the agent describes as having undergone “a virtual re-build” - by its current owners.
Slick, sleek and stylish, the 190 square metre semi-detached family home comes with a chic, west-facing rear garden and ample off-street parking at the front and is within walking distance of Dalkey village, Sandycove, Hyde Park, Castlepark school and park and Bullock Harbour. It is on the market with Rosie Mulvany of Sherry FitzGerald Dalkey at €1.6 million.
The quality of the interiors is evident from the entrance hall, which has, unusually, glass double entrance doors, which open to an oak parquet-floored space with fitted storage. Maximising this light-filled space, the current owners also use the front part of the L-shaped space as a home office/study area with computer and TV cabling. An inner hallway has understairs storage, a feature oak staircase and a partially-tiled wet room with a walk-in rainwater shower.
The well-proportioned, dual-aspect living room to the left of the entrance overlooks the front of the property through a box bay window and is decorated with pale olive walls.
There is a large, dual-aspect ground floor bedroom next door, which overlooks an external courtyard at the rear.
A large L-shaped open-plan kitchen and family/dining space is at the rear of the property. The Kube kitchen incorporates trendy high-gloss champagne-coloured units with white Silestone worktops with integral sockets and phone charging points, and a matching island unit with a gas hob. The high-spec kitchen has travertine floor tiles and includes a full range of integrated appliances and double doors opening to the internal courtyard.
A plumbed utility room at the rear of the kitchen has additional storage and houses the comms systems.
The dining/lounge area sits under a large skylight and overlooks the rear garden through three full-height and full-width glass sliding doors, which open onto a rear patio.
Upstairs, a generous central landing space leads to three double bedrooms. Two equally sized double rooms with oak floors are at the front, one of which has a vaulted ceiling and both of which have built-in wardrobes. The main bedroom at the rear also has oak floors, a fully-fitted walk-in wardrobe and a large en suite with a Villeroy & Boch suite and a rainwater shower. The similarly fitted main bathroom has a bath with an overhead rainwater shower.
Castlepark school is a few minutes’ walk away, as are local speciality shops, restaurants and pubs. Public transport includes Dublin Bus services and the Dart and there are coastal walks and facilities and a choice of sports clubs within strolling distance. Dún Laoghaire town, the refurbished People’s Park and the 40 Foot bathing area are all close by.
The residence is accessed via electric gates opening to a landscaped garden with off-street parking for multiple cars. A paved marble and sandstone path leads to the front entrance.
The rear garden is walled and fenced and includes a well-manicured lawn, several patio areas, well-stocked raised flower beds, a feature pond and waterfall and tidy gravel and sandstone pathways.
More details are available from the agent at 01-2751000.

Defining the CBD of Dublin is key for investors

Highlight: Where does the capital’s central business district begin and end, and what repercussions does this have for those wanting to snap up offices? 
Body


Dublin’s central business district (CBD) is expanding northwards and eastwards, a spread reflected in recent property market activity which has seen price tags of around €100 million for office blocks in Dublin 1.
Nevertheless, offices in the traditional CBD can still achieve premiums over the newer parts of central Dublin.
While it’s a common adage of the property industry that location is the key factor which decides where to buy property, the reality is that locations change. The Dublin docklands have become an example of how shiny new buildings can transform an entire district, raising both the ambience and the value of most properties in the area.
For decades, large investors and institutions have preferred to buy offices in what is considered the prime CBDs of major cities as these offices are likely to secure the highest rents and show the greatest increases in value over time. Dublin is no different, but Dublin estate agents sometimes have different definitions of the geographical area of the CBD, and this is one factor which they use to haggle for better rents and prices.
John Ring, analyst with Knight Frank, argues that while the traditional CBD might only extend to Burlington Road, a broader definition of Dublin city centre could accommodate more of Dublin 4, out to Donnybrook, and all of Dublin 1. By postcode terms, Dublin 1 also includes Dublin Port.
Others argue that parts of Ballsbridge such as Bank Centre, Shelbourne Road, and Simmonscourt Road and Elm Park are part of Dublin’s central office area, but most regard these as a CBD fringe.
While CBDs often coincide with the city centre, the two concepts are separate: many CBDs are located away from a city’s commercial or cultural centre. It says that cities with strong conservation laws and building height restrictions, designed to retain the character of the historic and cultural core, will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city. This is quite common for European cities such as Paris or Vienna.
Dublin’s more modest size has meant that it has not seen a complete separation of the two types of activities. Nonetheless, there has been a drift eastward and northwards of the office district.
For more than 100 years, Dublin’s financial office district was centred around the banks, stock exchange and insurance companies in College Green, Dame Street, Dawson Street and the city centre squares. But from the 1960s onwards, most of them moved to modern, higher office buildings convenient to southside Dart and bus routes, while former CBD buildings were occupied by pubs, hotels and shops.
When most Dubliners talk about the city centre, they usually refer to the shopping and pubs district between St Stephen’s Green and Henry Street. When estate agents refer to CBD, they are more concerned with the areas where offices achieve the best returns.
Most international employers and investors continue to opt for Dublin’s CBD, despite lower rents and prices in the suburbs and regional cities. Research from CBRE shows that there are currently 37 office schemes at various stages of construction in Dublin city centre.
Lisney says that about 343,000 square metres of office accommodation are due to be completed in the Dublin region before the end of 2020, and that 82 per cent of this is located in the city centre.
Equally interesting is how yields, reflecting property values, show that new high-specification buildings in the north docklands have been keeping pace with similar properties in the traditional CBD.
A few months ago, German institutional investor Triuva settled for a net initial yield of only 3.95 per cent when it bought No 1 Dublin Landings for €164 million. That yield is in line with the 4 per cent being achieved for prime CBD, and suggests that investors now consider that north docklands riverfront offices are in Dublin’s CBD.
However, occupiers may need more convincing, as rents in some parts of north docklands appear to lag those in the CBD. The National Treasury Management Agency is paying €538 per square metre for its premises with river views at No 1 Dublin Landings in a deal agreed about 18 months ago.
That compares with the €511.60 per square metre which WeWork recently agreed for its 9,966 square metres at No 2 Dublin Landings which does not have the same views. WeWork has also agreed to a rent increase of 10.47 per cent at first review, which would bring it to more than €565 per square metre.
But those rents still lag current prime CBD headline rents. Lisney’s first quarter report said that the “tone of the top headline rent is now approximately €667 per square metre”.
CBRE’s more recent April report estimated it at an even higher €700 per square metre for “prime headline office” rents.
But an even higher headline rent of €750 per square metre is suggested by a deal which Green Reit recently signed with TD Global Finance Unlimited Company, which is taking 985 square metres at One Molesworth Street in Dublin 2 in the heart of the traditional CBD.
Its annual rent payable is €740,000, which could equate to a headline rent of €750 per square metre, but the rent per square metre is effectively less, as the tenant secured a nine-month rent-free period at the outset.
Still, the recent Dublin Landings rents show that even the more remote parts of the north docklands are quickly closing the gap on traditional CBD.

Executive class act from Audi

Highlight: Audi thinks its new A6 is the ‘greatest all-rounder’ in the mid-sized premium saloon segment. It’s hard  to disagree, writes Matt Robinson 
Body


This is the fifth generation of Audi’s mid-sized executive saloon, the A6. It launches into a fiercely competitive marketplace that was once dominated by BMW’s 5 Series – but recent new products from several manufacturers have muddied the waters somewhat.
While BMW’s current 5 Series remains a strong contender in this segment, it is no longer the default choice. Mercedes’ latest E-Class is a technological tour de force, Jaguar’s XF still looks lithe and has a superb chassis and Volvo has also rejuvenated its previously staid, also-ran offerings with the distinctive S90 four-door.
Later this year, Lexus will also overhaul the GS, evolving it into a freshly-nameplated car called ES, while rumours abound that Alfa Romeo is working on a bigger saloon than the Giulia, based on that car’s underpinnings, but challenging in the 5 Series’ domain. There’s the oft-overlooked Maserati Ghibli to consider, too.
Into this wades the fresh A6 and – while it preserves much of the Audi saloon’s previous strong points – it aims to add to them with lots of technology and a sharper chassis set-up. So it’s still a very handsome, if reserved car in appearance, while inside it has a class-leading cabin, replete with three crystal-clear digital screens for all the main displays.
The two-tier centre stack items are both touchscreens that feature haptic feedback, so although there are fewer physical buttons in the new A6, you still get the feeling of ‘pressing’ something when operating the Audi’s climate controls and satnav.
If this technology looks familiar, that’s because Audi has already debuted it in the larger A7 and A8 ranges, which have also been recently refreshed. The A6 sits on the same platform as those cars and so it uses a wide array of equipment to make itself known in the executive segment. All new A6s will be mild hybrid electric vehicles (MHEVs), using a belt-alternator starter in their drivetrains to allow engine-off coasting at high speed and earlier use of the fuel-saving stop-start functionality in traffic. It’s a 48-volt system on the bigger six-cylinder cars and a 12-volt system on the four-cylinder versions, but it can save up to 0.7 litres/100km, according to the manufacturer.
All A6s will also be automatics of some form, as take-up of the manual gearbox on the previous-generation model was exceptionally low. An A6 V6 diesel has an eight-speed torque-converter automatic called Tiptronic, while all other, less-torque-heavy engines use a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch auto. There will be some front-wheel-drive derivatives of the four-cylinder models in the coming months, according to Audi, but for now all launch variants have quattro four-wheel drive – again, there’s a split, as the S tronic gearbox can be fitted to a more efficient ‘quattro ultra’ set-up that runs in front-wheel-drive mode most of the time, whereas the Tiptronic has permanent quattro all-wheel drive.
Four suspension set-ups will exist, starting with two types of conventional springs and dampers (normal and 10mm-lower Sport), as well as adaptive dampers and full air suspension on both axles. Options in terms of the chassis will run to four-wheel steering and an active anti-roll system.
Talking of engines, at launch there will be three variants in Ireland and another 2.0-litre petrol option will join this line-up soon after. For now, there are two diesels and a petrol, Audi still clearly pinning its hopes to a diesel revival in the face of falling sales and shaky consumer confidence in the fuel type. Two of these engines, the 286hp/620Nm 50 TDI 3.0-litre V6 diesel and the 340hp/500Nm 55 TFSI 3.0-litre V6 petrol, are familiar from the A7 and A8 ranges.
But the third is an all-new powerplant, debuting in the A6 not just for Audi, but in the entire Volkswagen Group. It uses the same architecture as the group’s existing 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbodiesel, but whereas the old engine uses a steel block, the new one is made of lighter alloy.
So new is this engine that Audi and Volkswagen haven’t even homologated it yet, so the only figure we know so far is that the maximum output is 204hp. That means it will carry 40 TDI badging, which is unique to Audi, but expect this engine to spread far and wide within the group in the coming months and years.
Back on the subject of the A6 specifically, the car has marginally increased in size and is stiffer in the bodyshell, and Audi reckons it’s the “greatest all-rounder” in its class. The German company is promising some extra driving enjoyment in the A6’s previously safe chassis, to go with its typical solidity and refinement, to make this a tempting proposition to businesspeople.
Before we go onto the 50 TDI, which formed the bulk of our test drive, a quick word on the 40 TDI. It might not convince the staunchest of diesel-haters, but that doesn’t detract from the fact this is a brilliant engine. It’s smooth and rev-happy, quiet unless extended right out and it feels muscular enough in the mid-range to suggest it is all the engine a regular A6 needs. We look forward to more time behind its wheel to find out.
The other thing that struck us about the 40 TDI, which was thrown into stark relief by time in the 50 TDI, is that it seems to be a case of ‘the simpler, the better’ with the new A6. Our 40 TDI test car had regular steering, adaptive dampers and 19-inch alloy wheels, and it had a fine ride, was whisper-quiet and felt pretty impressive in the corners.
The 50 TDI we drove, by comparison, was near-fully-laden, with active anti-roll, four-wheel steer, air suspension and a set of exquisite 20-inch alloys. However, while it was still comfortable and capable in the corners, there was more of a pattering sensation to the way the suspension dealt with a series of ripples in the road surface that made us think it would be an expensive option you’re best avoiding at ordering time. By no means drastically compromised, the jittery rear axle on the A6 with air suspension is an unwelcome intrusion into an otherwise serene cabin.
Nevertheless, having sampled a wide range of the available launch A6s, it’s clear this is one of the toughest competitors in the class. It’s elegant to look at inside and out, well-equipped with some real cutting-edge technological highlights, spacious (there’s a 530-litre boot and four tall adults can sit onboard, although the centre-rear seat’s footwell is compromised on space due to the transmission tunnel) and it drives beautifully in a wide variety of situations.
There’s definitely more to come from the Audi A6 as the range develops and expands in the near future, and its pricing (once confirmed) will be key to its ultimate success or otherwise, but what about the company’s claim about the “greatest all-rounder”? Well, on this early showing, we find it very hard to disagree. It’s an excellent car in every respect.

Highlight: A Victorian house with stunning sea views in Skerries, Co Dublin, has been well maintained by its owners of the past 30 years 
Body


A new agent and a price drop of some €250,000 to €950,000 should encourage families in search of a period home with enviable sea views to consider Harbour House in Skerries, north County Dublin.
The double-fronted Victorian residence extends to 200 square metres and boasts unobstructed sea views of the north and south beaches on either side of Harbour Road, the slim peninsular strip between the coastal town and promontory known as Red Island and which is home to Skerries’ Martello Tower and a waterfront playground.
The five-bedroom residence has a low-energy rating of E1, but boasts a raft of original features which have been well retained by its current owners over the past 30 years.
They include high ceilings, feature cast-iron fireplaces, detailed cornicing, bay windows and interconnected reception rooms.
And while it comes to market in good condition, it also offers a new owner the chance to perhaps upgrade the decor, modernise the large, farmhouse-style kitchen at the rear of the house and maybe soften the concrete-paved front garden with some seaside garden planting.
The wide entrance hall has parquet floors, dado rails, ceiling coving and an original mahogany railed staircase.
The drawing room to the left of the entrance overlooks the harbour and strand through a large bay window. The period room has high, corniced ceilings, a ceiling rose, a handsome cast-iron fireplace and neutral carpets.
Across the hall, the similarly decorated dining room has the same views, another cast-iron fireplace and period plasterwork, picture rails and good quality carpets.
A family room adjacent to the drawing room overlooks the rear of the property and has a cast-iron fireplace, while the kitchen opposite has parquet floors, a brick fireplace, a good range of base and wall-mounted units and leads into a conservatory at the rear of the house.
This space could potentially be amalgamated by a new owner into one bright, open-plan kitchen/family room with rear garden and south-beach views.
A WC and utility room at the rear of the house complete the ground floor accommodation.
Upstairs, there is a large, fully-tiled family bathroom on the return with a corner bath and a separate shower.
The five bedrooms are at first-floor level, including four large double bedrooms and a generous single. All of the rooms have carpets and the four double bedrooms all have fireplaces.
The rear, south-facing garden is landscaped and has parking for three cars via a laneway at the side of the house.
A Tidy Towns winner, Skerries hosts an abundance of amenities including shops, boutiques, cafés, restaurants and bars. Its leisure facilities and clubs include sailing, golf, rugby, football, GAA and tennis, and the town is surrounded by beaches and coastal walks.

Get your hands off our R&amp;D tax credits

Highlight: We have made huge concessions on our tax regime, yet critics are still baying for our blood 
Body


One of the immediate effects of the general data protection regulation (GDPR) which took effect in Europe last week, is to remind us of just how many online subscriptions we have.
We sign up to newsletters, merchant sites, publishers and God knows what else with a whimsical indifference to the knowledge and data we are surrendering to them. We leave our electronic fingerprints behind us all the time. The advent of GDPR has resulted in responsible companies from all over Europe getting in touch with those of us whose email addresses they retain on file.
They remind us of their existence while invariably assuring us that their record of our existence is safe with them. Companies cannot take the reputational risk of failing to be good data custodians.
Exempt from these new regulations are state agencies of all descriptions, including the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. We probably don’t need to be reminded of Revenue’s existence and it certainly never seems to forget about ours. Opting out is not an option with Revenue. But in addition to dealing with your tax affairs, you can opt in to receiving Revenue briefings, reminders and bulletins which issue practically on a daily basis.
One such bulletin caught my eye this week. Revenue tells us it is looking to hire external experts to help it police research and development (R&D) tax relief claims. Revenue’s paranoia about sharing anything remotely resembling taxpayer information outside the organisation is well documented, but there are times when it has to have recourse to external, private sector expertise. Dealing with R&D tax credit claims is one such occasion.
Someone has to decide when high-tech development starts and stops, and whether the development is sufficiently high-tech in its own right to warrant the tax relief claim. Hence the Revenue’s need for outside specialists, scientists educated to doctoral level who can assess in scientific terms what is actually going on in a company and whether some of it might be eligible for the tax break.
The R&D tax credit is one of the few survivors of the purge of tax breaks completed in 2011. It is available primarily to companies. R&D relief is, of course, of most benefit to businesses engaged in high-tech manufacturing. Almost by definition, it is not available to more routine wholesale or retail industries.
The R&D credit rewards expenditure on the people, equipment and buildings required to develop know-how, patents and other forms of intellectual property – the new foundations of economic wellbeing, in much the same way as abundant natural resources were the foundations in the past.
The R&D credit is unique for several reasons. First, not only did it survive the purge of tax reliefs, it was extended. More company investment qualifies now for the relief than in the past. Secondly, it is a benefit which can spill over to the employees of the company and reduce their personal tax bills, subject to terms and conditions.
And it is uniquely generous. Every €4 of the spend that qualifies further reduces the company tax bill by €1.
These factors have made R&D claims very popular, and have resulted in significant tax reductions for the companies availing of the break. Recent official figures suggest that some 1,500 companies have made successful claims each year for the past three years, at an exchequer cost in excess of half a billion euro annually. Tax largesse of that magnitude is hard to come by. When a tax relief is this effective, you begin to fear for its safety.
Despite the many tax regime changes for companies made over the last decade, the Irish system is still perceived to have a whiff of cordite. The elimination of stateless companies, the phasing out of the ‘Double Irish’ tax deferral structures and the creation of one of the tightest tax reporting and regulatory regimes in the world have not rebuilt the country’s reputation as they should have.
That’s mainly because most of the criticism comes from our competitors, with some of the Europeans still calling us tax pirates. Our politicians and officials shouldn’t be too thin-skinned as pressure continues for further levelling of our allegedly skewed tax system.
R&D relief in some shape or form is available in most developed economies. By and large, such tax breaks don’t contravene the EU state aid rules. The EU’s own alternative tax corporation proposals, the so-called Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, has provision within it for R&D relief. R&D tax credits scarcely received mention in last year’s Coffey Review of Corporation Tax except to note the scheme’s effectiveness in promoting the growth of research activity.
These factors should ensure its future. But in Ireland, R&D tax relief is also the gateway to accessing the Knowledge Development Box tax relief, through which eligible income streams get taxed at 6.25 per cent rather than at the mainstream 12.5 per cent tax rate.
Past concessions in Ireland’s corporation tax regime have been largely ineffective in dampening international criticism. By now there is little more left to concede.
There should be no more sacrifices made to secure the continued acceptance of the 12.5 per cent regime, which is about jobs as well as about tax yield.
The corporate sector was responsible for 1.9 million jobs in 2016. The recurring message from our industrial development agencies is that it is vital we grow our own multinationals – and the capacity for promoting research and development is critical to that.
Businesses across Ireland are doing what’s necessary to ensure our reputation for data integrity under GDPR. You’d have thought we had already done enough on the tax front.

Marketer Susan Bourke established LegalRSS.ie in Sligo last February, having worked as a digital marketing consultant to the legal sector for ten years.
An online marketing platform designed for the legal profession, LegalRSS.ie has tools for content and social media management, image and article archives and newsfeeds. Bourke hit upon the idea for the venture after realising that many of the solicitors she was working with were struggling to market their firms online.
“Since 2008, I’ve been working with the Law Society of Ireland on their CPD Cluster events, so I had first-hand experience of solicitors struggling to market their firm on the web and social media sites,” she said.
“I could see that they knew they needed to keep their websites up to date, but they didn’t have either the time or the expertise to do it. They needed someone to help them create valuable legal content for their clients.”
Bourke, who has a Master’s in digital marketing, works with retained court reporters and professional writers and editors to create content for LegalRSS.ie clients. The start-up is a partner of LegalRSS.co.uk, which was set up in 1997 by professional practice marketing consultant Joe Reevy.
Bourke has long-standing entrepreneurial roots, starting 11 years ago when she sold DVD box sets online showing people how to create webinars.
“It was then that I got the bug of selling online. After that, I created an e-book on how to treat head lice. It was bought by a company in New Zealand, and I am still getting the royalties from that,” she said.
“I also ran my own marketing and training consultancy firm, and while working with solicitors through that company I saw the huge need that was out there for specific legal content services.”

How Grow Sales uses science to support sales people

Dublin company Grow Sales is using tools and strategies developed in the US to help companies falling behind on sales targets to assess and improve the performance of their sales people.
David Shannon, the former managing director of Ballygowan’s water cooler business, set up Grow Sales in 2013 after reading a whitepaper penned by Dave Kurlan, founder of Objective Management Group (OMG), the Massachusetts-based sales assessment company.
“I’ve been involved with commercial teams my whole career and I’d used psychometric and personality tests on my sales teams,” said Shannon.
“My experience was that there were really no predictors for success in the field. Some worked, some didn’t, and I had no idea why.”
Kurlan’s whitepaper The Modern Science of Salesperson Selection used empirical data to look at how companies might better determine the potential success or failure of new sales hires in a given role.
Among the obstacles that might hinder a potential new hire, he identified need for approval, a tendency to become emotionally involved and discomfort with issues involving money.
On the need for approval, for example, Kurzan wrote: “Many people choose sales after being told they had a perfect personality for selling.
“Sales people who need their prospects to like them often make that a priority over getting the business.
“Sales people with a need for approval usually have difficulty asking tough questions and often have a fear of rejection.”
On the issue of money, Kurzan found that many sales people were uncomfortable “escalating” a question about budget.
“Their discomfort prevents them from helping a prospect figure out how to pay or even where the money could possibly come from,” he said.
“When prospects don’t have the budget, can’t envision increasing the budget or don’t know how they can find the money, the sales person empathises rather than digging deeper, asking questions and making suggestions to solve the monetary shortage.”
On foot of his findings, Kurzan developed a structured programme for assessing sales people and helping companies to improve their performance by identifying and addressing the weaknesses he had identified.
He established Objective Management Group in 1990. As OMG’s partner in the Irish market, Grow Sales uses software and diagnostics tools developed by the US company.
“We measure scientifically the 21 core competencies of modern selling, before we embark on an improvement programme,” said David Shannon.
“We come at it from the point where we assume every sales person and manager is different and has different gaps in their capabilities and their skills and competencies.
“Beyond that, we look at the company’s wider sales systems, processes and strategies and we then put programmes in place to fix the issues.”

PRII awards shortlist out
The shortlist for the young communications professional of the year in the annual Public Relations Institute of Ireland awards has been announced.
Louise Walsh, associate director at Drury Porter Novelli, Sophie Eustace, a senior account executive in sport at Wilson Hartnell, and Tabitha Bourke-Cooney, account director at Teneo PSG, made the shortlist. The winners of this award and the other awards in the PRII’s Excellence in PR awards will be announced on June 22.
In other PRII news, its vice-president Justin Green is now chair-elect of the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management.
Last year, he joined the board of the confederation, which represents public relations and communication management associations and institutions around the world.
Green, who is managing director of Wide Awake Communications, will take up the position from July. He will be the first Irish person to hold the role. He is a former president of the PRII, and a PRII Life Fellowship recipient in 2017, and an honorary life fellow and global ambassador for both the African Public Relations Association and the Public Relations Society of Kenya.
Car brand Škoda has launched a €120,000 advertising campaign in Dublin Airport. It will include a six-panel takeover at the sky bridge in Terminal One and a large vinyl of the Škoda Superb Combi at the walled areas at three of the baggage reclaim belts in Terminal One.
The campaign will continue its ‘Made for Ireland’ brand proposition, which it introduced 18 months ago. It claims that although the cars are not built in Ireland, they suit modern-day Irish lifestyles.
Created by advertising agency Boys and Girls, the Dublin Airport campaign uses popular characters from ancient Irish history and mythology, such as St Patrick, King Lir, Cú Chulainn, Fionn Mac Cumhaill and Oisín and Niamh, to show how Škoda’s current range of vehicles would have fitted into events in Irish history and mythology.
Cathal Kealey, marketing communications manager at Škoda Ireland, said: “Over the six months that the campaign will be live, the Made for Ireland creative will be seen more than six million times, which is a massive footfall for this high impact campaign.”
Boys and Girls worked with photographer Alex Telfer to create the ads for Dublin Airport.

Leasing is the popular option as investors eye industrial property

Highlight: The market is in a healthy phase of recovery and, with fewer developers in the space, should continue to grow 
Body


When the market was at its peak, there were more than 30 active industrial property developers. At the time of writing, there are four active developers constructing speculatively (ie currently on-site and constructing).
They include Green Reit, which is building Horizon Logistics Park; Exeter Property Group, which is constructing Greenogue Business Park; and Rohan Holdings is building at Dublin Airport Logistics Park and North City Business Park (and all three developers are clients of JLL). Mountpark Developments is the fourth.
Obviously, the restricted number of suppliers suggests the volume of stock produced between 2003 and 2007 cannot be repeated for reasons of capacity. This lack of supply should protect rents and provide yield stability as the market depth for prime industrial stock will remain thin due to lack of developers.
Nigel Healy, director of industrial at JLL Ireland, said: “I believe that the industrial market is currently in a healthy phase of recovery which should see continued growth in the short to medium term for a number of reasons, including the fact that there are fewer developers in the space, limited development funding, and the last few years have seen a change of occupiers.”
The traditional source of funding has significantly altered as new capital requirements for the banking sector have evolved and the pillar banks remain cautious. Assuming occupational demand remains, this issue pushes the occupier to look in other directions for funding.
So we return our focus to the model that prevailed through the 1980s and early to mid-1990s. During that period, most occupation was done under long-term leases, as an absence of credit (not unlike the situation now) forced most occupiers away from an ability to purchase. While we are not quite experiencing the same pattern of occupation as occurred then, a sizeable portion of occupation is evolving under lease structures. Over the past five years, there has been a steady increase in letting activity (over sale activity).
Some 67 per cent of transactions in the Dublin industrial market in 2017 were for letting rather than sales. Letting activity has grown in popularity steadily since 2013 when sales and lettings were more evenly balanced, at 51:49, respectively.
[caption id="attachment_417224" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Green REIT’s Horizon Industrial Park at Dublin Airport[/caption]
This is unlikely to change in the short to medium-term as the traditional funding model has changed – perhaps forever. However, the good news is that the more flexible nature of occupational leases, as they move a little closer to European models, and the upward-downward nature of rent-review clauses have created a much more tenant-friendly environment.
There is a swift change occupier. As bigger corporates need third party logistic (3PL) support, some seem more comfortable using the global service providers notwithstanding the fact that the indigenous 3PL providers have evolved and now offer sophisticated operations capable of delivering a quality service. The market has also seen a trend towards consolidations, with the major 3PLs now looking to amalgamate into larger units to reduce cost and improve efficiencies.
With the onslaught of online retailing, this trend is evident with traditional high-street retailers, who are taking control of their own distribution to account for greater online sales, as well as pre-existing online retailers expanding.
The vast increase in data centre activity has also accounted for a significant take up of industrial space (some of it obsolete from a distribution perspective) particularly during the depth of the economic downturn. However, data centres are a heavy drain on resources, with power capacity being a primary concern for further growth in this area.

Limerick council commissions €70k regional rebrand

A lady, the sporting capital, the Golden Vale – Limerick has many identities, but now Limerick City and County Council wants to develop a strong brand to unify the area. The local authority plans to develop a new brand strategy for Limerick which will coordinate its own marketing activities and leverage the marketing activities of its strategic partners.
Limerick City and County Council is putting the brand strategy out to tender with an indicative budget of €70,000 plus Vat.
The successful tenderer will be asked to create a Limerick brand and marketing toolkit to guide the brand usage across all marketing communications platforms from digital, social media, audio, print, multimedia and outdoor.
The brand identity will need to support the development of Limerick as a vibrant economic and visitor destination and act as a unifier for everyone in both the city and county. It should promote Limerick as a contemporary international location to live, work, invest, study and visit.
The new brand will have to complement Limerick.ie, an online guide to living, working in and visiting the region. It will be employed across the full range of marketing and communications channels.
In addition to defining the brand, the successful agency will be asked to develop a plan to guide the process from brand launch to its strategic development, including a five-year implementation programme for Limerick City and County Council.
The new brand strategy will tie in with Limerick’s aim to become known as one of Ireland’s inward investment hotspots after 12,000 jobs were created in the region over the past five years.
More than €1.7 billion of investment by new or existing companies in Limerick has been announced since the Limerick Economic and Spatial Plan was published in 2013. The city is now the fastest growing Irish region for foreign direct investment outside Dublin.
Laura Ryan, head of marketing and communications at Limerick City and County Council, said: “We’ve had huge gains since the launch of the Limerick Economic and Spatial Plan in 2013 and now we want to go again, at all levels, including through this brand identity initiative. Limerick is now in a place that it can make a bold and creative declaration that it is a hugely attractive and competitive location to work live.”

Making scents of it all

Highlight: Add a delicious extra dimension to your garden through the use of perfumed plants 
Body


Scent is an ephemeral thing in the garden: if you don’t have it, you don’t miss it; but if you do, it can add so much to the experience.
There are all kinds of plants in the garden that do a good job, but they could do an even better one if they were scented. Some plant scents waft around; others, such as those of iris flowers and the leaves of pelargoniums, you need to get up close and personal to appreciate.
The obvious contenders are well known and easy to come by – lilies, lilac, roses, lily of the valley, honeysuckle and lavender. But there are lots of others that deserve to be included. Top of my list are peonies, tree lupin (Lupinus arboreus) and phlox.
I’ve recently discovered there are also quite a few summer flowering clematis that are scented and I will be seeking them out. Listed below are some cultivars to keep an eye out for.
Everybody loves peonies and some of them are beautifully scented. By choosing early, mid and late-flowering cultivars you can have colour and scent over a longer season.
Top of the list and said to be the most strongly scented peony is the pale pink ‘Eden’s Perfume’, which flowers in late spring and early summer.
Subtly scented single-flowered ‘Claire de Lune’ is a classy early season bloomer, ‘Coral Charm’ is an early/midseason one with orange flowers that fade to coral, ‘Angel Cheeks’ is a double pale pink end-of-midseason peony, while ‘Duchesse de Nemours’ is a creamy white, flowering in mid- to late season. Then there’s the old favourite, fluffy pink Sarah Bernhardt, a late season crowd pleaser.
Some of the best scented reds to look out for are ‘Peter Brand’, ‘Paul M Wild’ and ‘Inspecteur Lavergne’.
Plant peonies in fertile soil in a sunny position. They can be expensive but they are absolutely worth it as they will bulk up over the years to give masses of flowers.
Clematis are not known for their scent, except perhaps for the early flowering evergreen Clematis armandii, but there are several others that flower in summer and have good scent.
Clematis x aromatica, as the name suggests, is heavily scented with purple star-like flowers with rolled petals from June to September. It is herbaceous, so should be cut down to knee height in March. It is non-clinging so will need to be tied into a support or grown loose in the garden.
Clematis heracleifolia is a deciduous shrub-like clematis which is also called the tube clematis due to its tubularscented flowers. These appear in mid summer in shades of blue – Clematis heracleifolia ‘Cassandra’, ‘Davidiana’, ‘Wyevale’ and New Love are cultivars to look out for.
Another Clematis that doesn’t look like a clematis at all is Clematis rehderiana. This one has scented nodding yellow bell flowers that have been compared to Cowslip both in scent and in the look of the flowers but they are more like yellow ‘bluebell’ flowers.
Virgin’s bower (Clematis flammula) has white flowers with a strong scent of almond or hawthorn in late summer and is a tough plant that will grow where other plants would struggle.
Clematis ‘Sweet Sensation’ was bred from Clematis flammula but is more compact so well suited to a pot where the fragrance can be appreciated by a seating area.
Phlox paniculata is a herbaceous perennial, a cottage garden favourite that comes in lots of colours from white and pink to red, blue and various blends and has a delicious scent. ‘White Admiral’ is a stunning white, ‘Blue Paradise’ is a lovely purply blue and ‘Bright Eyes’ is a pale pink with a darker pink centre.
There are also some unusual colours such as ‘Grenadine Dream’ and ‘Mystique Green’. Divide clumps every three of four years and grow in a spot that does not get too dry. Cut off the finished flowers to encourage side shoots to flower.
There are lots of annuals and biennials to grow for scent. If you didn’t sow any sweet peas you can buy plug plants and plant them out now, as well as plants of nicotiana, heliotrope and sweet rocket. Night scented stock and mignonette can still be sown. Both have unpromising looking flowers but place them near where you sit and the sweet scent will pervade the air in the evening.

Marks &amp; Spencer takes its medicine

Highlight: Turnaround guru Archie Norman is doing the right things at the upmarket retailer, but its problems run deep, writes Andrea Felsted 
Body


Archie Norman, the famed turnaround specialist who is now chairman of Marks & Spencer Group, is hoping for a textbook turnaround of Britain’s biggest clothing store by value.
He is certainly reading from the classic first page: last Wednesday, the company announced £514 million (€587 million) of one-time charges, more than halving pre-tax profit in
the year to March 31.
The company denied this was a kitchen sinking. Indeed, much of the write-downs are needed. M&S is closing 100 of its stores that sell both clothing and food, so it must adjust the value of its ageing shops.
These charges might not be the last. Norman and chief executive Steve Rowe are also investing to improve M&S’s online business and its logistics network. The website needs to be fas
ter, and a new distribution centre built. Their predecessors already spent billions of pounds on this, so it’s fair to question the value of all that investment.
Nevertheless, with profits rebased, if Norman can deliver some improvement then they should rebound.
The report included some bright spots. Profit before one-time charges, although down 5 per cent from 2017, exceeded analysts’ forecasts. The company also said its clothing and home furnishings gross margin may rise as much as 0.5 per cent, as the sourcing environment becomes more favourable.
Meanwhile, customers in its clothing and home furnishing division increased for the first time in five years, while the pension surplus is approaching £1 billion. The company also maintained its dividend, sending the shares up about 3.5 per cent.
But the task is monumental. The 3.4 per cent drop in same-store clothing and home furnishings sales in M&S’s final quarter – more than double what analysts forecast – underlines the scale of it.
In the food business, Norman will invest in  lowering prices. The cost of this will be met by efficiencies, and increased volumes, which should mean better deals from suppliers. The company is forecasting a drop of as much as half a percentage point in the gross margin, and there’s a risk it will fall by more than that.
The bigger danger is that food loses its upmarket positioning, but then struggles to hold its own against the midrange supermarkets. M&S has form for this: under a succession of chief executives, its clothing has yo-yoed between being a value offering and a premium selection.
It’s still gyrating. Norman, whose background is in the grocery sector, also wants M&S to become more appealing to families. He has already talked about M&S being Britain’s essential clothing retailer. The focus on value and families risks plunging M&S into competition with the supermarkets and Primark. That’s a battle it can’t win.
Even with the bounce last Wednesday, M&S shares are down more than 20 per cent over the past year. They trade on a forward price to earnings ratio of 11.3 times, a deserved discount to Next’s 13.6 times.
There is no doubt that Norman and Rowe are taking a more realistic view of M&S’s problems than previous management teams. But their actions may be too little, too late.
Norman could yet work his magic, but M&S has lost its relevance to the modern shopper. It will need more than a series of store closures and a faster website to reconnect.

Highlight: Mainie Jellett, Paul Henry and Jack B Yeats shine in a collection of starry Irish art 
Body


Like good wine, an idea in the mind of an artist can lie dormant for decades before reaching full maturity. A headline lot at Adam’s this week is Jack B Yeats’s The Belle of Chinatown. It was painted in 1943, but its genesis can be found in sketches made during his 1904 trip to Manhattan. Yeats was captivated by the cosmopolitan atmosphere – Chinatown was a favourite haunt, and he revelled in the dramatically contrasting light caused by the skyscrapers lining the urban canyons. The result is a scintillating vignette of the city, peopled by a little girl, and an old man selling five-cent hats. Measuring 35.5×46cm, it is expected to realise €80,000–€120,000.
On a similar theme, painted in 1944, Colin Middleton’s Belfast Street with Children marks a subtle change of direction from his earlier, gently nostalgic depictions of the same subject. The surreal element which dominates his later work is evident in his use of colour and scale, 61×51cm (€18,000–€25,000). By the early 1960s it was in full flood, as in Red Landscape, 1962, 50 x76cm (€8,000–€12,000).
Leading the sale is Counting the Flock, Walter Frederick Osborne’s pastoral idyll, gifted by the artist to his close friend, Sarah Purser. This is Osborne on a theme close to his heart – a rolling landscape beneath wide skies, populated by sheep, safe under the watchful eye of their shepherd. Coming fresh to the market, it measures 33×40cm and is expected to fetch €100,000–€150,000.
In 1923, not so much a breath of fresh air as a tsunami blew into Dublin when Mainie Jellett became the first to exhibit abstract art in Ireland. Darling of the establishment George Russell dismissed her work as “artistic malaria”, and “sub-human art”. The Irish Times poked fun, publishing an image of one of her paintings alongside one of a wonky onion, captioning them Two Freak Pictures. Jellett stuck to her guns and by 1927 the Irish Times had changed its tune, hailing her as “the only serious exponent in this country of the ultra-modernist school of painting”. The following year she represented Ireland at the 1928 Olympics art exhibition. It was during her studies (with Evie Hone) under Andre Lhote and Albert Gleizes in Paris that Jellett’s eyes were opened to the revolutionary idea of ‘form for its own sake’, work based on a knowledge of rhythmical form and organic colour. Abstract Composition dates from 1925, 91×71cm (€20,000–€30,000).
Paul Henry is represented by A Bog Pool in Wicklow, a small oil measuring 23×33cm, hence the estimate of €35,000–€45,000, and Portrait of a Lady, circa 1910–1914. A note inscribed on the back adds to its value, ‘For Dear Grandma from Paul’; 22×13cm (€6,000–€8,000).
Coming down in price, there are three Louis Le Brocquy watercolours, Wicklow Landscape, 1992, 25×35.5cm (€6,000–€8,000), and two each guiding at €3,000–€5,000, Cashel, 1988, 18×26cm, and St Stephen’s Green, 1990, 18×26cm.
In the sculpture section Ireland’s warrior queen is the subject of John Behan’s bronze, Queen Maeve with her Wolfhounds, 29cm high (€2,000–€3,000).

SIFI gets state backing
The government has committed to providing funding of up to €25 million to Social Innovation Fund Ireland (SIFI) to match private philanthropic donations secured by the organisation over the next three years.
Since it was established in 2015, SIFI has raised €12 million in funding, half through private philanthropy and the remainder from government.
The fund has backed 31 social innovations over three years through 11 funds supporting initiatives for communities, youth mental health, educational disadvantage and equality.
Beneficiaries have included Intercultural Language Service, a language learning centre for socially excluded migrants, and iScoil, an online learning community for early school-leavers. SIFI has partnered with Google.org, Medtronic, Mason Hayes & Curran and IPB Insurance as well as SMEs, foundations, trusts and private individuals.
With this new national fund, the organisation plans to create more funds to address issues such as homelessness, climate change, rural decline and gaps in education.
“I am proud to announce significant support for Social Innovation Fund Ireland’s groundbreaking work,” said Seán Kyne, Minister of State for community development.
“In just three years, they have demonstrated that Ireland’s communities are innovating to tackle the social issues that affect them and that, with grant funds and business supports, they can grow and spread.”

AA Ireland has acquired 21 new vans for its breakdown assistance service from Ford Ireland in Cork at a cost of €488,000. The investment in AA Rescue began in 2017 with the acquisition of five custom Ford Transit vans in followed by a further 14 Transit vans and two Connect vans earlier this year.
“The summer period is always a busy one on the roads and no one wants to experience a breakdown while they’re driving with their family,” said Brendan Nevin, chief executive at AA Ireland. “This timely purchase will ensure that we can respond to our members in an effective manner to minimise any inconvenience their breakdown could cause.”
Last year, AA Ireland invested €11 million in a number of areas, including a technology upgrade.

Office space provider Glandore spends €2m on Dublin facilities

Company: Glandore
Done Deal: €2m investment
The clincher: “We provide flexible space, which means we can take in a company needing as little as one desk and allow them to grow with us as they need it” – Michael Kelly, founder
The family-owned flexible workspace company Glandore has opened two new facilities in Dublin city centre at a cost of €2 million.
The 300 desk spaces at the facilities on Fitzwilliam Court and Fitzwilliam Place bring to more than 2,500 the total number of spaces the company has at eight hubs in Dublin and Belfast.
A family business established in 2001, Glandore is led by managing director Michael Kelly, who opened his first shared workspace at 33 Fitzwilliam Square.
“Our very first client was the reinsurance company White Mountains. They came to us with two people, grew to 14 and stayed with us for about two and a half years,” said Kelly.
“As our first customer, they gave us a sense of what the market required. They needed a landing space and to be able to grow their business without having to move to another place. That allowed them to get to the point where they were sure they weren’t going to grow their team any further so they could look for suitable long-term space. Facebook came to us in 2008, also with two people, and they grew with us to 50 people before they moved on.”
Glandore’s two new shared workspaces on Fitzwilliam Place and Fitzwilliam Court will have hot desks, private offices, meeting and event spaces. Also on offer will be catering, legal and financial advisory services, club rooms, lounges and showers. Virtual offices will be priced at €80 per month, while hot desks will cost from €325 and dedicated desks from €495.
Companies using Glandore’s six facilities in Dublin and two in Belfast have scope to scale from one to 350 staff in fully-furnished private offices, said Kelly.
“We provide flexible space, which means we can take in a company needing as little as one desk and allow them to grow with us as they need it. They don’t need to commit to 10 or 50 desks on day one,” he said.
Glandore’s new workspaces were officially opened last Wednesday by Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys.
“Some of our country’s most dynamic and celebrated multinationals began their life in Glandore’s workspaces,” she said. “They include Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and current member Autodesk. A ready supply of quality office space is a key part of ensuring that the Irish economy continues to grow and prosper.”

Social media-savvy artists bid farewell to the garret

The stereotype of the starving artist might soon be a thing of the past, thanks to social media. Dublin-born Fran Halpin has been working internationally as a full-time commercial artist since her graduation from DIT, Fine Art in 1997. Her first solo show takes places in Dublin’s Smock Alley on June 2, and Halpin has already sold 80 per cent of the work after building up a presence on social media.
“Being an artist, or rather a new breed of artist, social media enables me to build an exciting and scalable online business,” she said.
Using mainly Instagram and community-driven Facebook groups, Halpin has already sold seven large original paintings from her first solo exhibition collection.
“There is now a waiting list of 60 for my print collection and this is growing each day,” she said.
Halpin had already built a following on social media for her mural work, but to promote the exhibition she began sharing the journey from creation to the final product.
This was not a sales strategy. She just wanted to share this new project with her followers. “Little did I know it would have such a huge impact on my sales,” she said.
“Social media is a game-changer for increasing not only my reach, but building fans who are willing and excited to travel to my opening. Instagram is fantastic for reaching a new audience and with the smart use of hashtags, profile descriptions and landing pages you can extend to new audiences and build an online following.”
Halpin also found social media useful from a personal development/support perspective. She is a member of the Biscuit Community, an online creative group which provides support and education.
“Being a creative entrepreneur who usually works solo in a studio can feel lonely and isolating. Social media, specifically the Biscuit Community, has opened up a whole new world for me and my work.”
Halpin is also increasing her profit potential by offering copies of the paintings for sale.
Each painting in the exhibition has been scanned by the Copper House, a gallery in Dublin, using the Cruse scanner, which produces images far exceeding the results achieved by photography and conventional scanner. This is then printed onto the finest quality paper.
To maximise sales during her exhibition, Halpin will accept orders on these type of prints as an entry product for the audience.
“I believe art needs to be accessible to everyone of every budget. It looks like I will have to increase my print order with the Copper House printers by 150 per cent to keep up with the demand from my social engagement around this offering.”

Splash out with all the trimmings

Highlight: In today’s interiors world, frills and fringes are the new finishing touches to any home, writes Julianne Kelly 
Body


The traditional home of the 1980s and 1990s with swags and tails, flowing tablecloths on every side table and ruffled valances grew distasteful to us as interior design progressed to a classic contemporary style.
Braids and trimmings were sucked into the underworld of uncool furniture and furnishings, dragged down by tassled, frilled and fringed pieces. These once beautiful, grand interiors with palettes of warm deep red and golden yellow hues, oozing in comfort and sumptuousness became suddenly stuffy, busy and pompous. Trimmings found themselves at the centre of this archetypal old-fashioned style – looking weighty, superfluous and fussy.
Culture changed and trendsetters across Europe and America dug their heels into schemes that were pared-back, clean-lined, light-enhancing and contemporary.
However, slowly but surely, trimmings, braids and – my favourites – fringes and pompoms have come back. It’s not that the wheels are rotating us back to the days of swags and tails, but the classic contemporary cool grey, Scandi-style, hotel-esque sleekness has run its necessary course.
More to the point, we don’t have to polarise interior styles. We can blend multiple styles and be playful.
As with our wardrobe, trimmings bring soul and style into your interiors through colour, pattern and finishes. And speaking of fashion, let’s be honest about where this trimmings resurgence came from: the fringed Saint Laurent bag and jacket, pompom trims on scarves, the braid on the Chloe handbag, tassels on leather jackets . . . frills and fringes are the new finishing touches.
There are many styles of trimming available at the moment, and each of our international fabric houses has its own gorgeous range of sample books dedicated to them.
A conservative (but no less pretty) way to add a trimming is to add a single length down the vertical edge of a curtain’s leading edge, a hard pelmet or along the edges of a cushion. Following the lines of the upholstered piece can add an elegant frame.
Often, although beautiful, braids can be quite wide so they will look in proportion on larger pieces like large curtains or the edges of a sofa or as a few inches around a headboard. We have done all sorts of designs with these wide, straight braids to add colour, pattern and a finishing touch to a plain upholstered piece.
Then there are pompoms, which come in multiple colours and sizes and are just plain fun. Pompoms are better suited to edges as on curtains, throws and cushions, and they have such a playful appeal.
Fringes are cropping up on lampshades and sofa edges: while they do have a retro appeal, think silky threads rather than heavy hanging cords, and Hollywood Regency elegance rather than old-fashioned trimmings.
All of the contemporary trimmings available now are cool and colourful, so channel your playful interior style and finish off your cushions as you would a designer handbag.

The best in Irish law honoured at awards

Highlight: The Irish legal profession celebrated an evening to recognise the excellence and achievements of the country’s leading law firms and teams at this year’s Clinch Wealth Management Irish Law Awards, writes Siobhán Maguire 
Body


More than 90 law firms, legal practitioners and in-house legal teams assembled recently for a night of celebration at this year’s Clinch Wealth Management Irish Law Awards.
The seventh annual black-tie gala took place at the Clayton Hotel on Dublin’s Burlington Road on May 11, bringing together attendees and nominees from across the country to celebrate the event.
To be nominated is itself an honourable achievement which is why the annual awards have become so celebrated in the Irish legal calendar.
This year’s gala was opened by Charlie Flanagan, Minister for Justice & Equality, and hosted by RTÉ’s Miriam O’Callaghan. In his welcoming address, Minister Flanagan commended this year’s nominees “who shape and deliver legal services locally, nationally and internationally” across all platforms “whether in a private or a public sector setting, working as a sole practitioner, partner or as an in-house lawyer”.
“Tonight’s awards are an opportunity to salute the excellence of the legal profession and to recognise and honour the outstanding achievements of individual lawyers and firms,” said Minister Flanagan. “It also provides the opportunity to reflect on the range of talents a legal practitioner needs to excel in this ever-changing environment.”
Myriad awards presented on the night encompassed key areas of the legal profession including employment law, excellence in client service, innovation, probate and litigation. The overall accolade of Law Firm of the Year, sponsored by Clinch Wealth Management, was awarded to Beauchamps, one of Ireland’s top commercial law firms. Founded in 1803, Beauchamps has been part of the Irish legal scene for over 200 years.
Upon accepting the award, John White, managing partner of Beauchamps, said: “We are delighted to have been recognised as the 2018 Law Firm of the Year. This award is recognition of the diverse and comprehensive nature of our client base and the trust our clients place in us.
“One of the most satisfying aspects of advising some of Ireland’s leading companies is addressing, first-hand, the variety of issues and challenges faced by business leaders in an expanding economy. I am particularly pleased that we continue to experience increased activity across almost every practice group and sector. This is the result of a sustained and deliberate strategy focused on our core practice areas.”
A very special award on the night was the Lifetime Achievement Award, an honour bestowed on persons who have shaped Ireland’s legal scene. The award, sponsored by the Institute of Legal Research & Standards, was presented this year to the Hon Ms Justice Susan Denham, in recognition of her “remarkable contribution” to the legal profession in Ireland over the last 30 years.
Tom Clinch, head of Clinch Wealth Management, who sponsored this year’s awards, said the ceremony was an opportunity to honour the excellence of Ireland’s solicitors and in-house legal counsels over the last year.
“Clinch Wealth Management is proud to support the Irish Law Awards 2018,” he said. “We are fortunate to count some of Ireland’s leading solicitors as our clients, so we are keenly aware of the extraordinary commitment required to achieve success in the legal profession.”
An interesting addition to this year’s awards included a focus on regional law firms and legal practitioners. Nominees in this category had the opportunity to win twice securing first a victory in their region with potential to top categories that spanned Connacht/Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Dublin.
Some of these winners included: Alastair Purdy & Co in Galway, who scooped Munster & Connacht/Ulster Employment Law Firm/Lawyer of the Year; Richard Grogan & Associates in Dublin, who won Leinster (including Dublin) Employment Law Firm/Lawyer of the Year; and PG McMahon Solicitors in Limerick, who secured Excellence in Client Service Munster.
Deirdre Burke from DM Burke & Co in Wicklow, who scooped the Leinster Sole Practitioner/Sole Principal of the Year, was also named overall Sole Practitioner/Sole Principal of the Year. Other winners from this category included: Jason O’Sullivan from JOS Solicitors in Galway, who was named Connacht/Ulster Sole Practitioner/Sole Principal of the Year; Kieran Mulcahy Solicitor from Limerick, who won Munster Sole Practitioner/Sole Principal of the Year; while Sharon Scally from Amorys Solicitor was named Dublin Sole Practitioner/Sole Principal of the Year.
Michael Monahan Solicitor, from Sligo, carried home the award for Excellence in Client Services, which was sponsored by Ormond Meeting Rooms. The Excellence in Marketing & Communications award was bestowed upon Dillon Solicitors, Dublin. That category was sponsored by the Financial Times.
Reddy Charlton Solicitors, also from Dublin, took home the title of Property, Planning, Probate Law Firm of the Year, which was sponsored by ENKI.
The impressive award of Solicitor of the Year, sponsored by MedLaw, was won by Stuart Gilhooley from Dublin firm, HJ Ward & Co.
Other winners included: Berwick Solicitors from Galway, who were awarded Connacht/Ulster Family Law Firm of the Year and Jennifer Weafer from Dublin firm Lavelle Solicitors, who was named Legal Executive of the Year.
Michael Irvine, solicitor and former president of the Law Society and now a member of the Board of Directors of the Irish Rule of Law International, was awarded the Special Merit Award for his project-base work in promoting the rule of law in developing countries.
This year’s event teamed up with charity partners which included: the Solicitors’ Benevolent Association; the Barristers’ Benevolent Society; and the Peter McVerry Trust.
The 15-strong judging panel on the night included: Dr Eamonn G Hall, chairman of the panel; Bart Daly, managing director of Frontier Legal Research Ltd; and Aoife Hennessy, lead solicitor in the Commercial Litigation and Employment Law teams of Sweeney McGann.
Katherine O’Riordan, event director, said: “The Irish Law Awards have become a huge success over the past seven years. The event has grown exponentially and this year we are delighted to have the support of Clinch Wealth Management in recognising excellence within the legal sector. The standard this year was exceptionally high.”

The exhilaration and risk of the start-up

Length: 783 words
Byline: Post Reporter
Highlight: They’re more precarious–and less posh–than a multinational might be, but start-ups offer the thrill and camaraderie of being in on the ground floor of something, plus real opportunities to make your mark 
Body


1. Culture
There’s nothing like the hustle and bustle of a small company getting on its feet, and all the enthusiasm and positive energy that typically comes with that.
There is plenty of hard work involved, but it goes hand in hand with rewards, like a shared goal, a great learning curve and no deep-seated precedents in the “we’ve always done it this way” mould.
Without an established corporate culture, there’s often a more casual working environment and ambition to try new things and succeed.
Larger companies tend to have established what works for them already. They usually have the financial luxury to try new things without dramatic repercussions.
Start-ups are more experimental, but they are also cash-strapped, so every decision matters. If you thrive on making an impact, taking responsibility and finding solutions, then a start-up is the place to shine.
Start-ups and SMEs rely on a small team of well-rounded people who can wear many hats. This develops the ability to be resourceful and adaptable, and gives an opportunity to learn lots about different roles.
The experience looks great on a CV, helps you work out what you enjoy most, and gives an excellent foundation for developing into more specialised future roles.
Larger companies can be ‘silo operations’ where different departments are isolated at all but the most senior ‘head of department’ levels.
In a larger company you can fall immediately into the hierarchy of the department; in a start-up or SME you’re likely to find yourself on a more even playing field. This can give both autonomy and an opportunity to make as much of the role as you can.
Being able to lead your own projects, develop ideas and bring suggestions directly to the owners makes for a fulfilling and purposeful job. Those who emerge as leaders may even be invited to become a partner or shareholder, as an incentive to hold onto talent.
In a smaller business, success, or otherwise, is more immediately apparent. The tangible results of your efforts and your colleagues can be celebrated and learned from.
Short-term milestones demonstrate progress and chart the future, and employees have a clearer perspective on business development.
By contrast, in a multinational with separate departments, remote working and the sheer scale of the business, it can be harder to see results.
Start-ups can be an appealing career move for the excitement, experience and opportunity, but there are potential risks too.
The attributes of the business model that appeal to some people would strike terror in others, who don’t relish a less-structured, fast-paced environment.
Like any job move, the career advice is to establish the specific opportunity, do the necessary research and due diligence, and then some soul-searching to decide if the role is right for you.
Consider the downsides, and use your interview to clarify whether or not the move makes sense. Areas to tease out include:
Working at close quarters in a small business means it really helps if everyone gets along.
A good recruiter will have assessed your personality fit to a degree, but ideally interview with the business principals and discuss their leadership style, motivation and ambition.
Decide if you like these people and their approach. Ask about the team and the personalities of those you’ll be working closest with.
Find out their skill sets and backgrounds. It’s in everyone’s interest that the team gels.
The pace can be frenetic and, on a tight budget, the equipment, working space and other creature comforts may not be what you’re used to.
Try to get a realistic preview of what your work life will look and feel like. Ideally, ask to spend a few days on-site interacting and watching how work gets done, before you formally commit.
The bottom line here is: will the business make it, or is there too much risk of failure? You need a sense of the company’s revenue, competitors and profit margins.
Ask the founder about current income and market ambition, current and future sources of funding, and where the company is on its anticipated growth curve.
If the job involves a salary reduction, and maybe some form of equity in the business, it’s all the more important to understand the probability of success and the timeframe.
A chat with people you know in the particular sector, or those with start-up experience, can also be helpful.
Different work environments and business models will always appeal to different individuals, and have their own challenges and rewards. However, discounting the challenges of a start-up employment, without full investigation and consideration of its unique development potential, can be short-sighted.

The rich get richer when you rig the game

Highlight: How Michael Noonan’s capital gains and corporation tax exemptions turned property investments into gold 
Body


Michael Noonan probably won’t be remembered as the man who created the rules that made many a man and woman rich, but today we’ll look at how the waiver on gains that was introduced in 2011 until 2014 stacks up against any other investment.
The rule stated that property that was bought between December 7, 2011 and December 31, 2014 would be free of capital gains tax (CGT), or in the case of property being owned by a company, it would be free of corporation tax (CT, which is charged at the same rate).
Initially, the idea was that you had to hold onto the property for seven years. Later, the rules were adjusted so that you could take all gains from January 1, 2018.
This profoundly changed the trajectory of investment in property. It became foolish not to bail in on the trade. Let us compare this long-enduring bull market in stocks against Irish property.
During that time, the S&P 500 returned about 125 per cent. Irish property on the other hand was a more meagre 65 per cent according to the CSO national property index.
On commercial property and development land, the gains were more impressive and better again on good projects. So we are going to look at situations where savvy investors got in; that means they bought higher-yield properties in good locations (or good land banks). In our accountancy practice we regularly see returns of investments made during that time of 100 per cent and more.
Imagine you put €1 million into stocks. At the time, the exchange rate would have gotten you US$1.34 million. The S&P500 was at about 1,220 so you’d have about 1,100 units of it at full price (we’ll assume you aren’t using futures or margin accounts). If sold at the start of January for 2,700 per unit you’d get $2.97 million, which reverts back to €2.45 million after fees.
The dividend yield during that time was generally below 2 per cent so we’ll say that you got $200,000 in that time and paid about half of it in withholding taxes in the US and then regular taxes in Ireland. This leaves about €80,000.
There are acquisition and disposal costs, as well as an annual CGT exemption, but we’ll set them to approximately nil given the size of the transaction. This leaves a realisable gain of €1.45 million, so your tax bill would be the guts of €450,000 and the end result is that you doubled your money. Add back the dividends and your total after tax return was 108 per cent.
Property is most certainly not a low-risk investment, but typically it is seen as less risky than stocks, so you’d expect stocks to return far bigger sums than property. In the example above you would have also undertaken currency risk.
Now consider €1 million worth of property that went up in value to €2 million. Rents are up about 70 per cent from their low point. Between the start of 2012 and the start of 2018, rents rose about 60 per cent. That means the 10 per cent yield people were buying in 2012 is now north of 16 per cent.
You would have made about €800,000 cumulatively when you factor in the increase in rents against your base cost. We’ll assume you pay 10 per cent in costs and 50 per cent tax on the rest, which gives a remaining sum of €337,000 (very broad figures) clean and clear in rents.
Now you go and sell that property for €2 million. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say you spent €20,000 on the disposal (unlike stocks, realising gains from a property requires a solicitor to do a conveyance and it’s far more involved with many parties compared to selling a stock).
This gives you a €2.3 million return, which equates to 130 per cent of the initial investment. Traditionally, to make that kind of money would require stellar levels of risk, but fiscal policy made it possible to obtain a return on capital of nearly 15 per cent, which is generally unheard of in an environment where so many factors were pointing towards recovery in the sector (in terms of stock and flow).
It isn’t the job of the government to make people rich, but in this instance that is exactly what it did - and it wasn’t a half-assed attempt, it was a golden opportunity. The trade-offs politicians have to make is how to resolve what they are faced with at the time, but in this instance it was made irresistible.
To give you another perspective, imagine you invested in something else entirely and the gain on it would attract taxation; you just look at the tax equivalent yield. To do that, you do a sum that looks like this: (1/1-tax rate), or 0.7, and apply that to the outcome.
For you to get €2.3 million back on any other investment if you did have to pay the regular rate of capital gains tax would require you to make €3.258 million. Put like that, it becomes a little clearer that we pawned a good chunk of the family silver to make ends meet. It was probably the right choice at the time, but in hindsight it looks very different.

The emergence of neural machine translation technology is paying dividends for DCU spin-out Iconic Translation Machines.
The Dublin company uses language software developed over a decade of research to offer automated translation services to the global legal sector. It is now shifting its focus from statistical to neural machine translation, an emerging AI technology that uses simulated neural network models to predict word sequences.
“What we’re doing has probably evolved more in that past two years than in the entire two decades prior to that, and that’s because of neural machine translation,” said John Tinsley, Iconic’s chief executive.
Iconic’s co-founder Páraic Sheridan and Tinsley established the company in 2012 with the release of their original product for the patent and legal translation industry. IPTranslator was built on research carried out at DCU through the ADAPT centre, the digital research hub funded by Science Foundation Ireland.
The company has since released newer online and plug-in translation products for the e-discovery and enterprise markets built on its proprietary Ensemble Architecture for Neural Machine Translation. These products allow clients to quickly and safely translate electronically-stored information into more than 50 languages.
“Our software is used extensively by law firms who work on large global cases, often litigation and e-discovery, where significant portions of the documents they need to review are in a foreign language,” said Tinsley.
“We have enterprise clients who are constantly publishing large amounts of new information to their website, be it help pages, technical documentation or marketing. Their users are global, and it’s too expensive and slow to translate all of the information manually. Our software allows them to do it instantly.”
Iconic Translation was last month awarded the Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) 2018 Impact Award in the License2Market category. The KTI Awards recognise commercial success in the commercialisation of publicly-funded research. Iconic was jointly nominated with Dublin City University (DCU) in the License2Market Impact category.
Tinsley and Sheridan started the company after licensing technology developed through research at the university.
“We’ve been selling globally since day one,” said Tinsley. “We have clients in Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East. They’re in industries like IT, automotive, legal and finance.”
Iconic raised seed funding of €400,000 three years ago with investors including Bloom Equity, Boole Investment Syndicate and state agency Enterprise Ireland (EI).
Tinsley and Sheridan used feasibility and commercialisation funding from EI to validate their business idea before establishing Iconic in 2012.
“Our team has used EI training programmes on export selling and digital marketing to help hone our skills in different areas,” said Tinsley.
Iconic employs 15 people in sales, software development and research science roles. The company has plans to take on five new sales people in the months ahead.

VW moves upmarket with new Touareg

Highlight: Modern but conservative, VW’s new flagship SUV is expected to be a huge success, writes Dave Humphreys 
Body


The last time that Volkswagen set out to produce a true flagship model it was under the leadership of one Ferdinand Piëch. That car was the Phaeton, a car that was over-engineered and ultimately lost Volkswagen a fortune on every model sold. Nevertheless, it was a defining car and remains well-loved by enthusiasts.
Now Volkswagen is setting out its new flagship, which is expected to be a greater success and unsurprisingly it is shifting from a saloon to an SUV. The new Touareg has been a while coming, but it signals a clear move upmarket for the five-seat SUV.
The styling of the new Touareg is modern though with the usual measure of conservatism we’ve come to expect from Volkswagen. Sharp creases in the sheet metal, in particular along the shoulder line, do enough to break up the car’s mass, however. There’s a modest increase in length and width, but more significant is the loss of 106kg from the overall weight. Flashes of chrome add to that premium image; however, if you prefer your SUV to look sportier, there is an R-Line specification that offers different bumper design and the option of larger-diameter wheels.
Up front is where the Touareg looks newest, with a bold grille that takes in the headlights as part of a single piece of design. Choose the more expensive Touareg Design specification, €11,000 extra, and you gain Volkswagen’s new IQ LED Matrix headlights. Like similarly named items from other brands, these advanced adaptive headlights offer higher levels of illumination at night, with the capability of dynamically blanking out sections so as not to dazzle other road users. It is in less well-illuminated rural areas that this system shows its benefit, offering not only brighter light but a wider spread of it too.
Inside, rear passengers get equally good levels of head- and legroom, the latter thanks to being able to slide the seat fore and aft to maximise space or increase boot capacity, which is up to 810 litres before you start folding seats down. The lack of a third row of seats may be a disappointment for some, but sister company Audi might not have been too keen on Volkswagen edging in on its Q7 model’s turf.
Still, what the Touareg lacks in seating capacity it makes up for in cabin quality. Its headline grabber is the ‘Innovision’ cockpit display. This highly impressive-looking system melds the dashboard and centre console into one large display. It comprises a 12-inch instrument display and a 15-inch touchscreen system for the infotainment system.
Unsurprisingly, it does come with a hefty price tag attached, costing an additional €3,643, and if you want to add the head-up display then you’ll need to stump up even more money. As standard, you do get a 9.2-inch Discover Pro navigation system, which is fine to use, but once you try the larger Innovision system, you’ll likely want it.
Initially, the Touareg will come with just the one engine, a turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 diesel, and this unit will be available in two power outputs; the 231hp engine will be standard, with a 286hp version commanding a €2,600 premium. Volkswagen is considering the introduction of a plug-in hybrid model that is already on sale in China, although there is no set timeline for this, and it’s unlikely to happen soon. Both diesel models feature Volkswagen’s smooth-shifting eight-speed DSG automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. We only had the opportunity to drive the more powerful version at the car’s launch, and it does indeed deliver a refined driving experience.
The 600Nm of torque affords the big Volkswagen no lack of pulling power, and that translates into a towing capacity of up to 3,500kg, which will no doubt appeal to some buyers. Volkswagen can even offer them an electrically retractable tow bar, albeit at the cost of €1,751. Unless you need the additional power, we reckon most buyers in Ireland will be well served by sticking with the regular 231hp engine, even with a full accompaniment of passengers.
Through tighter and more mountainous roads the Touareg rarely felt out of its depth. The weight loss certainly helps its cause, as too did the optional adaptive air suspension of our test car. This set-up includes electronically controlled anti-roll bars, like those already in use in the Bentley Bentayga and Porsche Cayenne.
Selecting the Comfort mode slackens these off to provide even higher levels of bump absorption. In urban settings this makes speed bumps fade away, and cracks in the tarmac go unnoticed, even on larger wheels. Another trick feature, although also optional, is the four-wheel steering. At speeds below 37km/h, it turns the rear wheels in the opposite direction to the fronts, reducing the turning circle down to almost that of a Volkswagen Golf. At higher speeds, the system turns the rear wheels in phase with the fronts, providing a sharper and more accurate movement when changing lanes on a motorway, for example. Standard cars will come with a passive suspension set-up on steel springs, which we expect may take some of the sheen off that highly polished ride quality. We’ll have to wait until the car’s arrival in Ireland later this summer to put them to the test.
The new Touareg has taken a considerable jump up in quality, but also cost. That starting price of €65,395 is soon eclipsed when you begin adding options - getting up past the €90,000 mark isn’t that difficult.
Some will see that as excessive, but for all that it costs, the Touareg does feel every bit the premium-quality product. Hide the badge, and many could mistake it for a car from one of the established premium brands. It certainly nails the brief for becoming the company’s new flagship SUV. Piëch would be proud.
Model: Volkswagen Touareg 3.0 TDI V6

Highlight: Four retail outlets in the Italian Quarter developed by the independent TD will go under the hammer soon, as well as a slew of other intriguing properties, writes Donal Buckley 
Body


More than 430 lots will be offered for sale in seven days of bumper auctions within the next four weeks.
This week will see two REA public auctions, while BidX1 will host online auctions with 330 lots over three days. O’Donnellan & Joyce will host an auction in Galway with 42 lots on June 8 and Sherry FitzGerald expects to have 25 properties at its auction in Leopardstown on June 20.
The highlight is expected to be four retail outlets at Quartiere Bloom, Lower Ormond Quay, Dublin 1, which BidX1 will auction on behalf of the receiver of some of the assets of M&J Wallace Ltd, a company formerly headed by independent TD Mick Wallace.
Wallace developed the units as part of an urban regeneration project which became known as the Italian Quarter. Comprising units 2, 4, 5 and 7 Bloom Lane, the four lots for auction have a combined €1 million guide price and an average size of 50 square metres. They generate €62,558 in annual rent, inclusive of Vat. While this suggests a gross yield of less than 6.26 per cent, they are considered to have potential for significant rental growth.
Two of the units are fashion boutiques, one is a hairdressing salon and the fifth is a coffee shop.
BidX1 will start with 171 mainly residential properties this Wednesday, followed by 97 more valuable residential and development properties on Thursday and 62 commercial lots on Friday.
Its most valuable commercial lot is 122 St Patrick’s Street on Cork city’s main shopping street, which has a €1.635 million guide price.
A terraced investment property, it extends to 648 square metres, and its ground and first floors are let to shoe retailer Schuh (ROI) Limited at a current rent reserved of €180,000 per annum. This suggests a gross yield of 11 per cent.
Its other two floors are vacant and are accessible from Perry Street to the rear.
The second most valuable lot is a block of seven tenanted apartments, Nos 1-7 Dorset Court on Dorset Lane, Dublin 1, whose annual rent total reserved is €86,700. At its guide price of €1.115 million, this suggests a gross yield of almost 7.78 per cent. Including one, two and three bedrooms, the apartments range in size from 44 to 88 square metres and are within walking distance of Dublin’s O’Connell Street.
On Tuesday (May 29), REA O’Connor Murphy will host a Munster and Connacht auction in Limerick with 23 lots, including five apartments in the Strand complex on Ennis Road in Limerick, which range in price from €190,000 to €245,000 each. Four of these units are tenanted, and their estimated rental values range from €1,000 to €1,600 per month. Also for auction are four apartments at Yeats Village in Sligo, priced at €81,000 each.
The following day, Wednesday (May 30), REA Dempsey Sothern will hold a public Leinster auction in Naas, Co Kildare, with 16 lots, including seven Dublin lots. The most valuable of these is a multi-family investment at 1-7 Aileach, Blakestown Road, Clonsilla, Dublin 15, which has a €925,000 AMV. It comprises seven own-door apartments, which are fully let and generate annual rents of €74,556, suggesting a gross yield of 8.06 per cent.
A commercial investment at Unit 1, The Park Business Centre, Cabinteely, Dublin 18, is let to Park Academy crèche at €16,000 a year and its AMV is €160,000.
Seven retail properties in the centre of Drogheda, Co Louth, will go for sale in Sherry FitzGerald’s auction on June 20, and five of them are priced at or around €100,000 each. Four are adjoining terraced properties at 6, 7, 8 and 9 Stockwell Street, beside an entrance to Drogheda Town Centre shopping centre.
The most valuable of them, 8 Stockwell Street, is let as a takeaway at €19,200 per annum and, with a €195,000 AMV, this suggests a gross yield of almost 9.85 per cent. The property extends to 105 square metres over three floors.
Its neighbour, 7 Stockwell Street, is let as a supermarket at €12,000 per annum and has a €110,000 AMV suggesting a gross 10.9 per cent yield. It extends to 110 square metres.
The other two Stockwell properties are vacant, and all four have ground floor areas ranging from 55 to 56 square metres with small back yards.
Nearby, a ground floor unit at 30 Peter Street, where a local Four Star Pizza franchisee trades, has a €160,000 AMV. The 50 square metre property currently generates €20,400 in annual rent, suggesting a gross yield of 12.75 per cent.
The 42 lots in O’Donnellan & Joyce’s have combined AMVs totalling almost €7.49 million.
Its most valuable lot, known as Marino at 17 New Dock Street, is a 176.1 square metre protected townhouse on a 0.124 acre site with gardens fronting onto three city centre streets.
In Claregalway Corporate Business Park, a 1,815 square metre property known as Unit 24 comprises four ground floor units with 18 offices overhead. It has a €385,000 AMV.
As many as 15 of its units are occupied with a contracted rental income of €5,800 per month, or €69,600 a year. This suggests an initial gross yield of more than 18 per cent. Seven office units are vacant.
In the sought-after Salthill area of Galway, a four-bedroom detached house, 19 Grattan Court on Fr Griffin Road, extends to 179 square metres and has a €575,000 AMV.
In south Co Galway, a detached home, Invermore House, Kilcolgan, on 0.7 of an acre, has a €475,000 AMV. Built in 1997, its five en suite bedrooms would lend themselves to Airbnb potential in this tourist area.

Company: Welltel
Done Deal: €4m acquisition
The clincher: “The acquisition allows us to offer a new portfolio of services to our customers” - Ross Murray, founder and managing director
Dublin-based business telecoms company Welltel is to move to new 12,000 square feet premises in Ballymount, having bought the voice and call-recording company Eyrco for €4 million.
Eyrco specialises in contact centre, call recording, voice-assisted AI and telephony services for large enterprises. The company was established in 2012 by chief executive Mark Evans, who will take on the role of managing director of Welltel’s new enterprise division.
The Eyrco acquisition gives Welltel access to 300 new customers, and brings its headcount to 70.
Welltel acquired ATS, a Dublin company selling phone systems and telecoms services to private and public sector customers in Ireland, last year. ATS had been in business since 1993 with 1,300 customers, including the Irish Stock Exchange, Version 1 and the Aldi Group.
Its acquisition allowed Welltel to offer end-to-end communications services, including phone system, connectivity, voice service, wi-fi, managed network and security-to-business customers in Ireland. The deal followed Welltel’s 2015 acquisition of NEC Support.
Welltel was established in 2006 by chief executive Ross Murray and co-founder JP Crilly. The company has 2,700 customers in Ireland and internationally. It sells cloud-based and on-premises phone systems, VoIP and ISDN, broadband services and unified communications.
Financing for the Eyrco transaction was provided by Capital Step. John Hannon of FinRes acted as corporate finance advisor. Legal advice was provided by Joe McVeigh of Baily Homan Smyth McVeigh.
“The acquisition allows us to offer a new portfolio of services to our customers,” said Murray.
“This will include enterprise-grade communications, compliance recording, speech analytics and workforce management solutions across five key vendors – Avaya, Liquid Voice, Mitel, Nice and Verint.
“Eyrco has been a market-leading provider of Avaya’s Unified Communications as a service solution and are the only partner in Ireland with the Avaya Partner in customer Excellence Award.”
Murray said Welltel would create ten jobs over the next six months and would continue to scout for potential acquisitions across the communications sector.

Work in progress: Earn your spurs on a first job

Highlight: Teenagers who start their first job this summer will discover financial independence, develop new skills and come into contact with the taxman for the first time 
Body


When it comes to rites of passage, the taste of independence that earning your own money for the first time gives is a significant step towards adulthood.
As the academic year draws to a close, many teenagers are about to dip their toe into the working world for the first time. Alongside financial independence, a summer job offers a chance to build skills and get to grips with a work environment for the first time.
“I remember giving nearly half of my earnings from my first job to my folks, but I also had a special sports jacket earmarked and I saved up and bought it for myself. Being able to buy something you want, be it clothes or something to do with a hobby or concert tickets, it gives a great sense of independence,” said financial expert John Lowe, managing director of financial advisory company Providence Finance Services, which trades as the Money Doctor.
According to Lowe, parents should impress upon their children the importance of money matters long before they start their first job. “A lot of the basics are left out in school and college when it comes to personal finance,” he said. “It might be boring, but it is necessary. Kids need to learn about the big bad world.
“Parents should bring little Johnny or little Mary into the bank, building society, credit union or post office when they reach the age of reason, so seven or eight. Open an account and start them saving whether it is Communion money or pocket money,” Lowe said.
“Bring them to the supermarket, explain that you have to pay for the groceries with the money you earned. They learn very quickly.”
And when teenagers start to earn their own money, Lowe suggests that parents ask them to contribute something to the family finances and also encourage them to save some of their wages “rather than blow it all on Electric Picnic”.
“It’s a good idea for kids to earn their keep, to get an idea that life isn’t free,” Lowe said. “Once they start thinking about it, they quickly realise how much they need to work to buy the things they want. That gives a real appreciation of value.”
Starting a first job also means dealing with the taxman for the first time.
According to figures from the Revenue Commissioners, just under 30 per cent of Revenue customers are aged under 18 when they first register with the tax authority.
“The first step before you start working for the first time, even if it is a part-time or temporary summer job, is to register yourself as soon as possible to avoid paying emergency tax,” a spokeswoman for Revenue said.
Apply for a personal public service number (PPSN), if you do not already have one. Next, the Revenue spokeswoman advised first-time workers to register for myAccount, Revenue’s online platform and register their job online via the platform’s Jobs and Pensions section.
Revenue will work out the tax credits that can be claimed and these will be automatically granted. “We will send a tax credit certificate to your new employer so that the employer knows how much income tax and universal social charge to deduct from your pay,” Revenue’s spokeswoman said.
If teens needs a bit of support when dealing with the taxman, parents can help. Typically, Revenue deals with requests from customers themselves, but the taxman will accept calls from a parent acting on behalf of their teenager “when the bona fides of the caller can be established and Revenue is satisfied that the parent is acting on the customer’s authority”.
As well as offering a chance to earn and manage their own money for the first time, a summer job can help teenagers to develop valuable skills.
Beatrice Dooley, president of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, said that, often, second-level students didn’t necessarily see the link between the skills developed during a summer job and those required for their future career. “They need a little help unpacking that, and making the links, and that is where we come in,” she said.
“Working in a shop, supermarket or restaurant for the summer can help you to develop communication skills, interpersonal skills, patience and organisational skills, for example.”
A summer job can also help to give teenagers a sense of what they might want from a future career. “Even if they say ‘I hated that job’, I ask them what did they like about it; what did they not like; what skills do they think they learned; what career might those skills be useful for in the future,” Dooley said.
“No experience of work is ever a waste of time. You mightn’t like a particular job, but then you learn what you don’t want from that experience. That lesson is extremely valuable.”
While many teenagers are not looking ahead to their future career when they apply for a summer job, gaining work experience during school and college will stand to them if they start looking for a full-time position after they complete their studies.
“If somebody has done a summer job of any kind, it shows a prospective employer that they have a level of motivation and get-up-and-go,” said Trayc Keevans, global director of foreign direct investment at recruitment firm Morgan McKinley.
Young workers should not underestimate the value of the skills they will develop working in a temporary, part-time position. “You get valuable experience in a working environment: the basics of time-keeping, getting on with peers, completing tasks,” Keevans said.
Employers will typically screen graduate applicants for specific skills. “So, for example, they’ll look for a sense of responsibility and accountability. Decision-making skills are also important,” Keevans said. “A summer job will teach you that.”
According to Keevans, the key thing graduates need to be able to articulate to prospective employers is “the relevance of the skills they’ve developed from their experiences”, whether that’s a summer job, helping out in a family business, volunteering, involvement with sports or clubs or travelling. Real-life experience, through a summer job or an internship, is something that graduate employers are keen to see on CVs.
Paul Vance, head of resourcing at KPMG in Ireland, said summer internships were “a fantastic way for students to gain insight into professional working life and explore potential future career avenues”.
“Students and their parents should look out for opportunities and programmes centred around supported learning,” he said. “Students want to come away with real skills that they can use to build their CVs.”
While summer work offers lots of benefits, it’s important that teenagers strike the right balance.
“Working during the holidays, I’d say absolutely yes,” Dooley said. “It’s a great idea, and something I’d encourage. It’s a chance to develop a real work ethic.”
However, continuing the job during term time is a different matter.
“Most schools take the approach that while students are in school, school is their job. For most people, your school days are the only time in your life when you are likely to have a chance to focus your energy solely on your education,” she said. “Working during the academic year takes its toll. It takes a lot of energy to sit through eight, nine classes a day, maintain your concentration and absorb what is going on.”
She believes students who opt to work weekends “have less energy, less focus in class”.
James Doorley, deputy director of the National Youth Council of Ireland, agrees that balance is key when it comes to teenagers’ first steps into the working world. “It’s a big step for a young person, starting their first job,” he said.
Doorley said young workers should be aware of their entitlements as employees. “So, for example, they are entitled to 70 per cent of the minimum wage if they are under 18, they are entitled to a payslip, and the first thing is to make sure all that stuff is in order,” he said.
The minimum wage is currently €9.55, with workers under 18 entitled to at least €6.69 per hour.
There is strict legislation on the number of hours younger people can work, with different rules applying during term time and school holidays. “The Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act defines very clearly how much they can work. So that it doesn’t interfere with their academic life,” Doorley said.
“That becomes a bigger issue as the labour market improves. We’ve seen cases in the good times when young people were lured into working long hours. There’s an attraction of income, but it shouldn’t impede their education or result in them leaving school or college with fewer qualifications. You don’t want them to miss out on what they want longer term.”

Highlight: Each week, we profile one of Ireland’s corporate leaders, tracing their career to date and exploring the lessons they have learned along the way. This week, we meet Ruth Hughes, incoming head of Kellogg’s Ireland 
Body


Ruth Hughes is the newly appointed head of Kellogg’s in Ireland. Established in 1906 by Will Keith Kellogg as the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, US-headquartered Kellogg’s entered the Irish market in 1924. It employs more than 200 people at its European headquarters in north Dublin. In her new role, Hughes will oversee a team of 30, managing all aspects of the company’s commercial operations in the Republic. Her appointment follows the retirement of Jim McNeill.
Tell us about your career to date.
I started my sales career at Batchelors before moving to the Boyne Valley Group as a business manager. I joined Kellogg’s in 2008 as a national account manager serving the company’s Irish retail customers. From there, I progressed through a number of commercial roles, including European commercial strategy, and spent time in Britain managing the Kellogg’s business with retailers Asda and Morrisons.
My most recent position was as sales director, European sales capability, with responsibility for overseeing the training and development of all sales teams across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.
Are you where you expected to be in your career?
I’m not sure that anyone in their early 20s really knows what their ultimate career goals are, I certainly didn’t, and I found that they evolved along the way. I’ve worked at Kellogg’s for ten years, and I can honestly say I really identify with the values and culture of the organisation. That’s why I have been very happy to develop my career here.
Our products are in the homes of millions of Irish people, so it gives me a huge sense of pride to now lead our Irish organisation. Not just because of our heritage, we’ve been selling our food here since the early 1920s, but also because of the importance of the Irish business for Kellogg’s. More cereal is eaten per head of population in Ireland than anywhere else in the world, so people trust us to deliver for them each morning.
I grew up with Kellogg’s products – Rice Krispies was always on the breakfast table at home–and now my kids eat Kellogg’s cereal, so I am genuinely proud and passionate about the company.
What was the best career advice you got along the way?
Be open to opportunities and don’t restrict yourself to one career path or functional area, there may be multiple routes to where you want to go, and understanding other parts of the business will enrich your experience for future roles. I’ve worked in a number of roles across the Irish, British and European operations – it all adds to your experience.
Something I also learned from a previous manager was the value of sitting back and thinking before reacting to a situation: there is no fire! That ethos helps me remain calm and make better decisions.
Based on your own experience, what are your top career tips?
Find a company that has a culture you can identify with and enjoy. What really motivates me about Kellogg’s is not just the people or products – it’s the DNA of who we are. It’s the fact our company is committed to giving back, whether that’s in our support for charities such as Dublin’s Crosscare or our sponsorship of the GAA’s Cúl Camps.
Work in an industry you love. I fell in love with the food industry because I love the variety and the pace of change; no two days are ever the same.
Treat others as you would like to be treated: how you do your job is just as important as what you do. There are no shortcuts to results or achievements. Hard work, and investing time and effort, is the only way. I’m studying a two-year executive MBA at UCD’s Michael Smurfit Business School because I believe that it’s important to continuously develop yourself and broaden your sphere of learning.
How would you define your work style, and how has this evolved over the years?
I have an open and approachable style. My team know that I am logical – I gather facts to make decisions, but also work to be flexible too. I’ve also been told I’m very calm. I learned early in my career that I don’t make decisions well when flustered or panicked.
In terms of managing teams and individuals, what are your insights?
Constant two-way communication is very important, that’s why my office door is always open. It’s important to help people to achieve their best by challenging them to push themselves, but to support them while they do so. Setting individualised clear goals and objectives is essential, and helps with performance conversations throughout the year.
What about communication and negotiating the typical ups and downs of working life?
You can’t over-communicate. The more clarity that your people have about company strategy or objectives, the better the buy-in and the more motivated they are to deliver. Getting to know people is important; we’re all people with lives and different backgrounds. If you have relationships based on trust and goodwill, you can achieve more.
Has networking played an important part in your career?
It’s been important to me to get to know my stakeholders in the grocery industry in Ireland – we can all learn from each other. My Kellogg’s colleagues across Europe and globally are very generous with their time and experience. I’ve had some great mentors.
If you had to choose another career tomorrow, what would it be and why?
I really admire those who see an opportunity and set up a new business, and I would love to be brave enough to become an entrepreneur at some point, but I suspect that I am too risk-averse!

Highlight: Artist James Earley’s new exhibition, Things Fall Apart, combines the personal with the political in a location that will surprise many, writes Nadine O’Regan 
Body


Walk into James Earley’s new exhibition space and you will find yourself catching your breath in surprise. In place of a traditionally austere setting, the Irish artist has located his debut exhibition in an industrial space: all exposed beams, dangling wires, peeling paint and flooding light, right in the heart of the city, next to the Clarence Hotel on Wellington Quay in Dublin.
Frankly, the setting is less Irish Museum of Modern Art and more MTV music video. It’s an edgy look, and the perfect context for Earley’s aesthetic. The Dubliner began his career as a street artist – he’s the man responsible for the large-scale mural on the exterior of Bloom’s Hotel in Temple Bar – and this exhibition represents his first move into a more traditional setting. There are 17 pieces in his exhibition, most hanging suspended in the middle of the room, and they pull their influences from hybrid forms. Earley is different – and he wants to make this a strength in his work.
“I feel like the stuff that I’m doing doesn’t necessarily fit the mould of any Irish gallery,” Earley says, as he walks me through the building. “I had a clear vision of what I wanted the show to be, and what I wanted the space to be. I wanted it to be industrial and rough.”
The venue has never been used for an art exhibition before. “I was able to use the space because I knew the owner,” he says.
Earley is well-connected in the visual arts. He’s a relative of Thomas Earley, who co-founded Earley & Company in 1864, which produced stained glass and ecclesiastical furnishings, at one point employing more than 100 people. The company closed in the 1970s and Earley was born in 1981, but his relations’ love of stained glass has fed into his new work.
[caption id="attachment_417152" align="alignleft" width="214"] Things Fall Apart – Stained Red by James Earley[/caption]
In the new exhibition, there are stained glass works, lingering near laser cut perspex pieces and silkscreens. It’s a thought-provoking mix.
Although Earley uses new and old technology, and materials that have radically different associations, the theme of the show is unifying. Earley has called it Things Fall Apart for political reasons – he cites Brexit and the wider social landscape – and also personal ones.
The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of Lianne Deasy, Earley’s sister-in-law, who passed away suddenly in her sleep last year. An image of Earley’s twin brother Mark, her husband, takes centre stage in the exhibition: it’s a tortured and emotional piece, freighted with meaning. “I’m welling up a bit thinking about it,” says Earley.
Family is important to Earley (his father-in-law, the actor Stephen Brennan, is just around the corner, helping to get the space ready in time for the opening). Although art can be a precarious way to make a living (these pieces will sell for a few thousand each), Earley hopes in the future to have a stained glass studio, just like his forebears.
“This is the first foray into that,” he says. “My intent is to do large-scale commissions of stained glass. I want to set up a stained glass studio. This is laying the foundation for a bigger picture.”
Such ambition. Is it all possible? Earley believes so.
[caption id="attachment_417153" align="alignright" width="229"] Portrait of Mark Earley by James Earley[/caption]
“I work extremely hard. I’m in the studio at half eight every morning. I leave at seven at night. And that’s six days a week. If you really want something, you can get it. It’s just about how much you want something. It’s all doable. It’s just about going about things with passion.”
James Earley’s debut exhibition Things Fall Apart runs at Dollard House, 5 Wellington Quay, Dublin 2, from 12pm-7pm daily until Sunday, June 3. See jamese.ie for more details.

INDIE
Snow Patrol
Wildness (Universal)
Are you even allowed to say you like Snow Patrol any more? I’m only half-joking. The Irish outfit has a number of hurdles to overcome in 2018, and they’re all to do with fashion and timing. For years, Snow Patrol have been lumped in with Coldplay and Keane as the makers of a certain kind of anthemic indie rock: heartfelt, but not necessarily cool. 
Then there’s the fact that the band haven’t released an album in seven years, making them the musical equivalent of Rip Van Winkle. With Wildness, Snow Patrol are arriving back into a radically altered environment. Ed Sheeran is omnipresent, Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Beyoncé are all-conquering, and bands such as Coldplay and U2 are just about hanging in there at the back of the leader pack. But here’s the thing: although Snow Patrol might have dozed off for seven years, Wildness is 100 per cent the work of a committed band. Across ten tracks, Snow Patrol deliver exactly the kind of album their longstanding fans will love: crunchy riffs; satisfying hooks; thought-provoking lyrics about loss, lit up by Lightbody’s melancholic lead vocals, and an overriding sense that this is an album proper, constructed with attention to flow, pace and a refusal to bow to trends (tellingly, there’s no sign of Kendrick Lamar as a guest). Dark Switch, Wild Horses and Life On Earth are highlights, but you’ll listen to this record from start to finish – and not hit the skip button. An absorbing, impressive return.

Ben Howard: Noonday Dream (Island)
British singer-songwriter Ben Howard has had an unenviable task to complete – how to drag himself out of an abundance of similarly inclined singer-songwriters into an area that makes him slightly different from the rest. The Brit Award winner’s 2011 debut, Every Kingdom, was locked into the definable ‘acoustic and pretty’ area – pleasant to listen to, but without any element of surprise whatsoever. His 2014 follow-up, I Forget Where We Were, shook things up considerably with several emotionally volatile songs, but Noonday Dream really takes things up a few notches. Ironically, for such a strong third album, Howard softens his approach. In doing this, he takes note not only of the music and songwriters that influenced him while he was growing up in Devon (John Martyn, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Nick Drake) but also of more esoteric and experimental musicians such as Arthur Russell and LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy. Between the Drake-inclined Towing The Line and the Russell-motivated What The Moon Does, Howard is doing what others too often ignore: gradually removing his work from the tried and tested into an area that he can validly call his own.

Roger Daltrey: As Long As I Have You (Polydor)
As heritage acts get older, they prefer to focus on the past instead of the present. The Rolling Stones’ most recent studio album, 2016’s Blue & Lonesome, revisited blues songs they cut their teeth on whilst surly teenagers; U2’s Innocence & Experience albums look back to their formative years. And here we have Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, releasing a solo album (his ninth, and his first in 26 years) that covers not only the music he performed prior to The Who being formed in 1964 but also a few songs that have inspired him through the decades. It’s a mixed bag of soul and blues (mostly cover versions) that blend his trademark bruiser of a voice with rough-edged arrangements. Assisted on guitar by bandmate Pete Townshend on seven of the 11 tracks, it nonetheless avoids comparisons with The Who by virtue of its R&B ruggedness. That’s the good news. The bad news is that Daltrey over-extends his ambitions with a stinker: a woeful rendition of Nick Cave’s Into My Arms. Aside from this, it’s moderately successful business as usual.

Highlight: Think you know everything there is to know about Europe’s largest southern country? Think again. Jessie Collins finds ten intoxicating treasures ready to be discovered in Spain 
Body


The city: Seville
The Spanish city currently on everyone’s lips, Seville is the capital of southern Spain’s Andalucia region, and the official home of flamenco and also some of the country’s most dramatic Gothic architecture. But it is the sheer amount of culture, art and food contained within this city that makes it such a hot destination right now.
For starters, Seville’s main cathedral is the largest Gothic example in the world, and you can access most corners, including the Giralda tower, which dates back to when the building was originally a mosque. A trip to the top also rewards with stunning views across the city’s spectacular skyline.
The city’s gastronomy is its heartbeat, with spinach and chickpeas and slow-cooked pork cheek particular specialities, as well as all the Iberico ham you can manage, washed down with endless amounts of manzanilla sherry. The food markets are standout, teeming with locals and with stalls heaving with fish and seasonal fruit and veg. Mercado de la Feria is Seville’s oldest market and is surrounded by tapas bars dispensing great local fare.
A flamenco show is a Sevillian must-see and Casa del Flamenco is the place to head to, with their hour-long shows on the historic, Andalucian patio which often feature top artists performing.
In terms of areas, the warren streets opening out on to hidden squares of the original Jewish Quarter of Barrio Santa Cruz demand exploration, while the Triana neighbourhood, known for its vibrant flamenco scene and delicious tapas should not be missed.

[caption id="attachment_417168" align="alignnone" width="300"] The Vigo coastline[/caption]
Tucked away in the north-western tip of the peninsula, Vigo is the gateway city to the area of Galicia, and probably still the road least travelled by many tourists. It’s an easy journey from Dublin, though, with Ryanair operating direct flights to Vigo itself that are often well priced, and once you get there, you are in the midst of some of the best food the country has to offer.
If seafood is your thing, this is the place for you. Using its Atlantic proximity to full effect, typical delicacies include octopus, while crabs, oysters, mussels and pimientos de padrón are abundant.
The coastline is wonderful here too, and with 1,500km of inlets and beaches there is so much to explore. Praia das Catedrais is just one of the more famous spots, but there are plenty others to discover off your own bat, with O Barqueiro and Estaca de Bares perfect little fishing villages to while away the day.
The Galician landscape may also seem familiar; its green mountainous terrain is certainly evocative of our own Atlantic shores. Be warned, though, the weather is also more tempestuous than the more Mediterranean areas, and very much governed by its Atlantic alignment, so high summer is the time to go if you are looking for a sunny break.
As for the wine, this is Rías Baixas territory, which has given us such drinking jewels as Albariño and Caiño tinto – basically, you can’t drink a bad drop here, which is surely halfway to holidaying heaven.

Sherry has always had its serious fans (don’t get a sherry lover onto the subject unless you expect to give up a full hour of your time), and other than wine, this is a national treasure. For the uninitiated, sherry is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalucia and comes in a variety of tastes and flavours, from light versions such as manzanilla and fino, to darker and heavier ones such as Amontillado and oloroso.
You can also get sweet options made from Pedro Ximenez or moscatel grapes, but it is the dry stuff that you will mostly find being sipped at the bar. In Spain, sherry bars are a serious experience, and can often be a thing of beauty, the drink having its origins back through the centuries, and some dedicated sherry taverns feeling as if they do too.
La Venencia in Calle Echegaray in Madrid is probably one of the best of the traditional haunts. The walls are smoke-stained yellow, with faded last century posters peeling back to reveal even more layers of smoke-stains, with bottles that pre-date Franco lining the shelves.
There is sherry, and only sherry, served here, with barrels of the stuff that would certainly put hairs on most people’s chests. To soften the alcohol measures, they serve a small, perfectly formed selection of tapas, all designed to match this beloved drink, and are essentially extremely salty, from brined anchovies, green as grass olives to almonds, iberico ham and especially salty manchego.
All that, and you may be sharing your experience with the odd cat who wanders in – it’s that kind of place. They don’t have a website, but you can find them on Facebook.
[caption id="attachment_417170" align="alignnone" width="300"] The Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid[/caption]
There is so much great art in Spain, with landmark museums such as the Prado and the Guggenheim in Bilbao drawing crowds from all over the world year-round. The Museo Reina Sofía, or Queen Sofía Museum in Madrid, though not quite as much a household name, is one of Spain’s most vibrant museums, and is also the permanent home of Picasso’s seminal Guernica mural, so worth a visit for that alone. There is plenty more besides, with the museum dedicated to Spanish art and containing one of the best Picasso and Salvador Dalí collections in the world. Contemporary art lives here too, with an upcoming retrospective on Russian Dadaism one to note, while work by Francis Bacon, Joseph Beuys, Max Ernst, Damien Hirst, Donald Judd, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, René Magritte and Henry Moore features in the main contemporary art collection. museoreinasofia.es
[caption id="attachment_417164" align="alignnone" width="300"] Oysters in the Galician port of Vigo[/caption]
Gambas pil pil, croquettes and tortilla need no introduction. What to eat in each region of Spain requires more consideration, however, with paella for Valencia, pulpo in Galicia and a dish that deserves a little more time in the spotlight is rabo de toro estofado, or braised oxtail. As Spanish as the Armada, don’t let the fact that this is bull’s tail put you off. It is slow-cooked in red wine until it melts in your mouth, and packed full of flavour thanks to its rich cooking on the bone. Cordoba, Madrid and Pamplona are the places to sample the best rabo de toro, with some Pamplona restaurants famous for this delicacy alone.
[caption id="attachment_417166" align="alignnone" width="300"] The Alhambra in Granada[/caption]
Granted, the Alhambra is not unknown, but this palace and fortress complex in Granada, just north of Malaga, is still up there in terms of visitor experiences and is one of the best examples of Moorish architecture anywhere, in particular the 14th century Palacios Nazaríes, together with the gorgeous Generalife gardens. It is the intricate work on show all around, from the glazed tiles, stucco and carved wood that is breathtakingly beautiful; each series of courtyards revealing another hidden treasure.
The best way to see the Alhambra is at night, with a kind of tranquility that gives a flavour of how it might have been during its height, around the 15th century. Also worth noting, the old town of Granada is a warren of cobbled streets all housing tapas bars that dispense food gratis, the tradition being that with each canya, or beer, you get a new nibble to try, free of charge. Half the fun lies in trying to get through all the options, and still managing to stand up.

[caption id="attachment_417169" align="alignleft" width="260"] Alcazar of Segovia[/caption]
Known in this part of the world for its red wine more than perhaps its tourism, the lack of direct flights from here into the region might put some off, but in reality its borders are only actually about an hour from Madrid. Situated in the more north-western corner of the country, below the northern Basque region, Castilla y Leon contains the magical cities of Salamanca, Leon and Segovia, famous for the fairytale castle that inspired the Disney’s Sleeping Beauty version.
The food, too, is centre stage, and beloved local dishes of roast lamb and suckling pig are the best anywhere in the world. Segovia is possibly within easiest reach of Madrid, and apart from the famous Disney connection, contains one of the most extraordinary examples of a Roman aqueduct which traverses its bustling centre.
A little further to the west lies Salamanca, a city that literally glows (it is known as La Dorada, the Golden One), thanks to the abundance of its sandstone buildings which are lit up to dramatic effect at night. The architectural mix makes this a fascinating destination too, with everything from Romanesque, Gothic, Moorish, Renaissance and Baroque all vying for attention.
Salamanca has a unique cuisine too, with hornazo, a savoury pastry stuffed with ham, bacon, sausage and hard-boiled eggs a local delicacy, as is farinato, a white Spanish sausage typically eaten fried with eggs. And yes, there is also suckling pig. This is the home of Spain’s first university, and very much still has a thriving student population, adding to its overall sense of fun and energy.
[caption id="attachment_417162" align="alignright" width="219"] The city of Seville[/caption]
Less explored by visitors to Spain, but certainly on the up, is the whole area of nature tourism on the peninsula, and there are some remarkably unspoilt protected areas that are also of major geological importance dotted around, particularly the province of Zamora. Close to the border with Portugal and in the Castilla y Leon area, Zamora is home to Europe’s largest glacial lake, the Sanabria Lake, with the area rich in deep canyons, hanging valleys and a series of smaller, glacially formed lakes.
There are historical monuments too, with the Cistercian Monastery of Santa Maria, and cultural experiences by way of the historic sixth century village of Puebla de Sanabria. The Avila province, west of Madrid, is also worth a visit, and contains the Gredos Mountain range, the Iruelas Valley (home to Europe’s largest colony of black vultures), the Serrota mountain ranges and a series of cathedral-like caves in the Tiétar Valley, thought to be three million years old.
[caption id="attachment_417172" align="alignleft" width="249"] Casa Loewe[/caption]
With origins dating back to 1846, Loewe is still one of the most successful Spanish labels around and, since its appointment of the Magherafelt-born JW Anderson as its creative director in 2013, has experienced something of a rebirth. The brand is beloved particularly for its leather goods and especially its bags, and remains steadfastly Spanish, with all manufacturing still based in Madrid.
When Anderson took over, he made a special point of working with the brands heritage, remodelling Loewe stores using designs based on its 1960s outlets, which were designed by architect Javier Carvajal.
He also dipped into the archive for inspiration, bringing back styles and lines from its mid-century heyday, and updating its classic Flamenco and Amazona bags, as well as adding a new classic to the mix, the Puzzle bag. This was an instant hit with its innovative cuboid shape, buttery leather and multiple forms (it can be worn in five different ways, from shoulder bag to clutch).
Loewe stores are dotted around the country, with the flagship address in Madrid remodelled in 2016 under Anderson’s eye, which saw it expand to three floors of the landmark 19th-century building in the Salamanca district of the capital. It has become something of a love letter to Spain, with almost all the construction materials used coming from inside the country’s borders. The art commissioned is a ceramic installation by Spanish artist Gloria García Lorca. “I see Casa Loewe as a space in open dialogue with Madrid,” Anderson says. If Madrid isn’t on your current checklist, you can find the label’s luxe accessories at Brown Thomas. loewe.com
[caption id="attachment_417175" align="alignnone" width="300"] Hotel Akelarre in San Sebastian[/caption]
Nestled on the hillside of Monte Igueldo just outside San Sebastian, this five-star hotel officially opened last July and has already won worldwide acclaim. Pedro Subijana’s Akelarre restaurant has been going since the 1970s, and has held three Michelin stars for much of that time, but this is his first foray into an extension of the business and with it he has created a nirvana for lovers of food, wine, art, culture and architecture.
The purpose-built modernist space sits next to the original restaurant, overlooking the Bay of Biscay, and it doesn’t waste the views. Each of the 22 rooms has a floor-to-ceiling vista of the water, as do the communal spaces, with the most luxurious of accommodation, the Akelarre suites, coming complete with plunge pool and dressing room, as well as luxe contemporary furnishings and state-of-the-art technology.
As well as the famous restaurant, there is a more casual dining space named Oteiza, which offers a Basque menu that will knock your socks off. And there’s a luxury spa too, with a swimming pool, hydrotherapy circuit, steam bath and sauna, plus three therapy rooms offering Sisley treatments. Rooms start at about €500.

Meet Ireland’s South American twin
Sunday Business Post

Length: 1017 words
Byline: Tomás Clancy
Highlight: It’s a tiny republic squeezed in between Brazil and Argentina, but Uruguay knows how to fight its corner - not just at World Cups, but in the wine world too 
Body


Uruguay is the second smallest country in South America, squeezed in south of Brazil and north-east of Argentina. It is a largely agricultural nation that is famously green, wet and windy.
Cows outnumber the human population by almost five to one, and that human population is just under four million. The country is split like Ireland, with almost half the population living in the capital and the rest scattered throughout an essentially empty, rural interior.
Beef is its chief export and, since the 1960s, this beef has been hormone-free and organic, with a grass fed national herd aiming to leverage its green, clean credentials to capture the international market.
It all sounds uncannily familiar, until, of course, we add in the final note: that in Uruguay, they grow grapes, along with olives and a few peppers and citrus fruits.
Uruguay’s wine regions are just an hour’s drive to the east of the capital, Montevideo, with the best vineyards and wineries situated a few miles in from the Atlantic coast.
There are two reasons why we have heard so little about Uruguay’s wines. One is that they fell in love with one of the modern world’s least adored grapes, tannat, a thick skinned rustic varietal that in France made famously rough, tannic wines. Secondly, and more importantly, wine-growing in Uruguay is a family affair, with hundreds of producers making tiny amounts, the vast majority of these consumed domestically in Uruguay.
There are a handful of larger, commercially run wineries, but even these have tended to focus on supplying the urban Uruguayan population, rather than seeking exports.
A little like Napa, Uruguay did not need to sell its wines abroad. Now, though, this wealthy, beautiful and politically stable nation has become a magnet for high-end fine wine and wine tourism investment.
The roots of wine in Uruguay are not as deep as those of neighbouring Argentina or Chile, where wine was brought by 16th-century adventurers and missionaries. Uruguay’s wine story begins in the 19th century with a wave of agricultural immigrants from France and Italy and pointedly with a Basque immigrant, Pascal Harriague, importing and planting what is now the national grape, tannat, from his native south-west France.
Tannat joined many other planted varieties, but it became hugely successful, because - unlike in AC Cahors or AC Madiran in France - when planted in warmer Uruguay, the tannat grape finally blossomed as a spicy and charming wine.
Despite this eminently commercial taste profile, wine remained the small-family enterprise, a bonus crop for many farmers who were primarily focused on cattle or sheep-rearing.
In the last 20 years, however, dedicated wineries have become more common, especially in the largest wine region called Canelones, near to the capital, and increasingly in the coastal region called Maldonado, much nearer the Atlantic, with stony soils and strong winds.
One of the most important developments in the past decade has been the arrival of Argentinian billionaire Alejandro Bulgheroni, who owns wineries and châteaux across the globe from Bordeaux to Napa, from Barossa to Mendoza. He brought with him the internationally acclaimed consultant winemaker, Alberto Antonini, who fights with Michel Rolland for the title of most sought-after winemaker on earth.
Frenchman Rolland tends to like and produce big beefy wines, with high alcohol and plenty of oak. By contrast, Antonini believes in lower alcohol, little oak and plenty of freshness. Rolland is the poster child of Napa Valley, while Antonini is beloved of quiet, savoury, slightly quirky wines from Burgundy, the Jura, Barolo and a new wave Italy of which he is an exponent.
This is where Bulgheroni and his Bodegas Garzon have hitched their wagon.
The best and most interesting of Uruguay’s wineries have clearly decided to avoid the race to the bottom. They are a farming nation whose cattle rival our own in terms of traceability and high standards. Their wines are headed in the same direction; aiming high rather than trying to be the next place to make a cheap merlot or sauvignon blanc.
There are, as yet, very few wines from Uruguay on the market, but they are on their way. O’Brien’s have been supporters for several years and now Bodegas Garzon wines have arrived. The winery has more than 1,000 separate vineyard parcels draped over rolling hills, not a million miles in appearance from Tuscany. They are planted on granite and poorer soils, rather than the clay and deep loam of other parts of Uruguay, and the elevation in quality is palpable.
The vines are all handpicked, and the cellar work is lavish with concrete tanks and eggs just as in Pomerol and hippest Tuscany. Ageing for the white wines is in steel tank on lees, with no oak, while the reserve level reds get just six months in oak. Freshness and dynamic pure fruit is being sought and found. The tannat is startlingly fresh and bright and subtle.
Quirky, well made and determinedly unspoilt and even non-commercial in orientation, the arrival of Uruguayan wine onto the world market is a leftfield joy, and a reminder why we love the ever-evolving world of wine.

For the third year, we asked you, our readers, to consider a submission to The Sunday Business Post/ Penguin Ireland Short Story Prize. And we were, in a word, inundated. The brief was simple: write an original short story of up to 5,000 words in length. The response spanned every conceivable subject matter and genre, and the remarkable standard of creativity on show made the judging process a lengthy, if hugely encouraging, experience.
More than 700 stories led us to a final ten, our shortlist, and last Tuesday we announced our winning, second and third placed stories. This verdict was reached through the expert consideration of our award partners at Penguin Ireland, and on behalf of the Magazine I would like to extend renewed thanks to the publisher’s managing director Michael McLoughlin and editor Brendan Barrington.
Vital thanks of course go to each and every reader who took the time and effort to put pen to page. There is, as we at the Magazine can go some small way to appreciate, a certain agony to that blinking cursor, the sentence that refuses to write itself as you would like. A short story is no mean feat to achieve, and it is a powerful thing. As the author Neil Gaiman said, “Short stories are tiny windows into other worlds and other minds and other dreams. They are journeys you can make to the far side of the universe and still be back in time for dinner.”
Today we share just three stories. The first, by our winner P Kearney Byrne, is Nahari Liske, a story Penguin’s Brendan Barrington describes as “something genuinely strange, and genuinely original”.
The second, by Colm McDermott, is a psychological mystery story entitled White Noise, while the third placed story is The Knot by Michelle Coyne, a stirring exploration of the relationship between body and mind.
Each will take you somewhere else entirely, and back again.

This week, I will mostly be:
This charming film went under the radar somewhat when it was released in 2015. It stars Susan Sarandon as a fast-talking widow, who finds herself unable to resist sticking her beak into other people’s business, particularly her heartbroken daughter, played by Rose Byrne. Sarandon is brilliant as the lovable meddler and her love interest is played by JK Simmons with an enormous moustache.
The winner of the comedy award at last week’s British Podcast Awards touts itself as “the number one podcast for those involved or just interested in the production of beef animals and dairy herds”. Doesn’t sound like a hoot, does it? It is though. Creator Benjamin Partridge sends up traditional farming radio shows in such a deadpan and comic way that I have found myself guffawing on the street more than once.
The 2018 series is nearly upon us - June 4 has finally been confirmed as the start date. Love Island 2017 was the surprise telly hit of the year. It was funny, warm, gripping and addictive, and I have high hopes for this summer’s gang of sexed-up singletons. Oh, and if you’re interested, Jamie and Camilla from last year are still going strong. My heart.

A catastrophe plays out in full colour

Highlight: Knowing nothing of history and swayed only by his own ego, Donald Trump makes decisions based on what a reality TV character might do. But as the wrenching disaster in the Middle East demonstrates, his strategies have horribly real consequences, writes Marion McKeone 
Body


The cumulative catastrophe of Donald Trump’s seat-of-his-pants, shoot-from-the-hip foreign policy – and the suffering it has caused – was exposed last week. Thus far, the Trump administration had been relatively lucky in that the consequences of foreign policy fashioned from grievances and the never-ending quest for instant gratification have not morphed into catastrophic blowback.
Trump’s French, German and British allies may be furious with him over his abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal, but what’s the worst that can happen? He’s not invited to Prince Harry’s wedding? Renewed Gallic hauteur casts an icy pall on the blossoming Trump-Macron bromance? Or the cranky European Council president fires off a snippy tweet?
If it’s a Twitter war the EU wants, then Trump is, as he would say himself, locked and loaded. He has few peers when it comes to firing off cyber-insults. When it comes to confronting his critics face to face, however, he’s somewhat squeamish.
But the brutal human consequences of the Trump doctrine of conducting US foreign policy according to the whims and needs of his extended family became clear for the first time last week in the clashes that left 60 Palestinians dead – including an eight-month-old baby – and thousands more injured.
In terms of timing, Trump’s decision to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem could hardly have been worse. The 70th anniversary of Nakba Day, which marks the expulsion or involuntary fleeing of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homes and the start of Ramadan, ensured tensions were already running high.
But Trump ignored the rising temperatures and so his daughter and son-in-law got to stand beaming beside a plaque bearing that most sacred of things – the Trump name.
Until now, US policy has been that the status of Jerusalem should be determined by Israel and Palestine and the US’s role should be limited to that of an honest broker or impartial arbiter. The US has relinquished that role with its capitulation to Benjamin Netanyahu, and received nothing in return. It has squandered what little credibility it had left in the region by exchanging an ace for nothing, not even the lowest-ranked card in the deck.
Had the US insisted on an end to illegal settlements in the West Bank or even an end to the Gaza blockade, it could have salvaged some credibility while advancing the peace process. But Trump had no long-term strategy, other than to bolster Netanyahu, an old friend of the Kushner family, and accede to the demands of Trump’s Zionist backers – thereby ensuring that billionaires like casino mogul Sheldon Adelson bankroll his next campaign.
Trump cannot be blamed for the seething cauldron that preceded his arrival in the Oval Office, but he can be blamed for giving Hamas the propaganda victory of its dreams: the image of an impeccable Ivanka Trump unveiling the plaque with her father’s name, juxtaposed with the searing image of a Palestinian mother sobbing over the body of her baby daughter.
Meanwhile, the suspenseful build-up to the grand finale of The Apprentice: The World Stage continues, as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un obligingly ratchets up the tension – and media attention - ahead of the scheduled June 12 Singapore summit by throwing a ‘Will he? Won’t he?’ wobble into the mix.
Kim’s mid-week tantrum helped divert media attention from the mess in the Middle East, following national security adviser John Bolton’s cack-handed insistence that North Korea’s nuclear disarmament follow the ‘Libya model’ – that it be the swift, complete, irreversible and thankless – destruction of North Korea’s nuclear weapons capabilities.
In what parallel universe (other than John Bolton’s planet of one) could the US’s deal with Libya be regarded as an inducement to any foreign leader to give up a rusty battle tank, never mind its nuclear weapons programme? A turkey’s vote for Christmas seems sane by comparison.
As has been written in this newspaper repeatedly, Kim Jong-un will not, on June 13, or at any date in the foreseeable future, voluntarily dismantle the nuclear weapons programme his grandfather and father defied international pressure, isolation and crippling sanctions to develop. Not if he wants to survive.
For Kim Jong-un – and there is reasonable evidence to support this theory – the only thing that lies between his leadership and his bloody ouster is North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, its formidable conventional weapons programme and the bloody mayhem it could unleash on South Korea, Japan and possibly – but by no means definitively – the US. As everyone knows, past acts are the best indicator of future behaviour.
But in the meantime, it’s all eyes on Trump. And that’s just how the former reality TV presenter likes it.
“President Trump has forged a new category of international relations that I would call ‘diplotainment,’ and the Singapore meeting is going to demonstrate diplotainment at its pinnacle,” Daniel Russel, the Asia director at the National Security Council under president Barack Obama, told the Washington Post.
Diplotainment is the perfect hybrid word to describe Trump’s approach to foreign policy. It’s all about the ratings and it’s all about Trump. And to keep the audience interested, he must spice it up with feints, phony threats, and last-minute cliffhangers.
All very well if this were a TV game or a reality show. But, as we saw in the Middle East this week, Trump’s diplotainment has very real human consequences.

A defeat for the repeal of the Eighth Amendment would have radical and profound consequences
Sunday Business Post
May 19, 2018

Length: 1120 words

On Friday, you and I will collectively decide whether a girl aged 14 who becomes pregnant as a result of a rape must either carry the rapist’s child to full term, or quietly leave the country to terminate her pregnancy in another jurisdiction which has some compassion for girls of her age in such circumstances.
That is the issue before us. A No vote confronts such a girl and her family, if she has one, with a cruel choice of ruining her life by becoming a mother against her will before she is 15 - or else leaving the country on a lonely journey to avail of services denied to her in this country.
There is no way of dealing with such a girl’s case by inserting, say, a rape exception to the “unborn’s” equal right to life in the Constitution.
There is no workable constitutional formula that would permit the law to decide whether there has been a rape and whether the 14-year-old rape victim has a legal right to terminate the pregnancy.
The present situation is not one which can be justified on the basis that “hard cases make bad law”. Fourteen- year-old girls are raped, as we found out in the X case and the C case. Every pregnancy involving a 14-year-old girl arises from a very serious criminal offence.
Either we institutionalise injustice in our Constitution by denying such a rape victim the right to terminate her pregnancy if she chooses, or we repeal the Eighth Amendment.
Far from there being a basis to excuse such inhuman treatment on the basis that “hard cases make bad law”, we now know that “hard cases and bad law together make for tragedies”.
The problem with the Eighth Amendment is that it was always based on an ideological untruth. Very few people, apart from religious theorists, believe that the status of an embryo before or after implantation in the womb is in any real sense equal, in law or in common sense, to the girl or woman being made pregnant.
If we really believed that the “right” of such an embryo to life was “equal” to the right of the mother to life in law and under the Constitution, we would never have amended the Constitution in 1992 so as to permit a pregnant girl or woman to travel abroad for the purpose of terminating her pregnancy.
The false equation of the right to life of a girl or woman with that of an embryo led inexorably to Supreme Court decisions such as the X case and the cases in which the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Spuc) could obtain injunctions stopping people in Ireland from accessing or providing information regarding the availability of abortion in other countries.
Sometimes people forget that the Supreme Court in the X case upheld the concept of travel injunctions to prevent abortions and only decided that in the particular circumstance of the X case, Ms X was not prohibited from travelling abroad for an abortion because her life was endangered by her pregnancy.
In so doing, the Supreme Court decided as a matter of law that she was, in those circumstances, also entitled to a termination of her pregnancy in Ireland.
As night follows day the Eighth Amendment, unless it is repealed, prohibits the termination of a pregnancy in Ireland for any victim of rape or incest, or for cases of fatal foetal abnormality, or in cases where the medical risk to health arising from pregnancy falls short of a risk of death, such as the medical risk of very serious and life-changing side effects to women suffering from certain types of diabetes.
A Yes vote on Friday does not enact into our law the views of the Citizens’ Assembly or even the views of the Oireachtas committee as set out in their report. It simply confers on the two Houses of the Oireachtas the right to legislate in relation to the termination of pregnancy in Ireland, a right which existed up to 1983, but was taken away by the Eighth Amendment.
The Attorney General recently advised the government that the penalty for unlawful abortion in Ireland had to be a serious penalty. A prison term of 14 years is the maximum punishment for any girl or woman who procures a termination by, say, taking an abortion pill in Ireland, or for any person who assists a girl or woman to do so, such as a parent or a friend.
As I wrote here recently, this is no academic or theoretical threat. In Belfast two years ago, a girl who ended her pregnancy at the age of 18 by taking an abortion pill was reported to the police, prosecuted, convicted and given a suspended sentence of nine months.
The Northern Ireland Pro Life movement, Precious Life, condemned the punishment as too lenient and pointed out that the maximum sentence to which she was liable under the law in Northern Ireland was life imprisonment.
Leo Varadkar, our Taoiseach, is the leader of a government which has proposed the repeal of the Eighth Amendment by way of a constitutional referendum.
His party, which could afford posters urging the abolition of the Seanad by referendum and the passage of the Children’s Rights referendum, on this occasion has chosen not to identify the party with the repeal proposal or to publish posters identifying the Taoiseach personally with a call for a Yes vote.
Do posters matter? We may find out on Saturday. As things stand, every party of the left has found the resources to publicly identify with the repeal proposal.
Fine Gael, as a party, abdicated its responsibility to publicly identify as a party with this proposal. Some of its deputies have published their own posters. Many have not. The subliminal message is one of weakness and absence of leadership.
The Taoiseach has a few days in which to make absolutely clear where he and his party stand on this issue (even allowing for dissenters availing of the rare opportunity of a free vote).
A defeat for the repeal proposal on Friday would have radical and profound consequences for this country, for the government and for the Taoiseach personally.
Unlike the Seanad referendum where Enda Kenny sustained an unexpected “wallop”, a rejection of the repeal referendum could well be a knockout blow if the public form the judgment that the Taoiseach and his party showed insufficient leadership and commitment in the campaign to restore common sense and truth to our Constitution.
Today’s Sunday Business Post poll should not be seen as any basis for political complacency. The margin between Yes and No is narrowing. In the Seanad referendum the margin began to narrow in the last week; this issue is not the same as the marriage equality referendum. The issue is much more difficult in terms of any “feel-good factor”. Strength of conviction will determine which side turns out in the greatest number.
The Taoiseach and the government must demonstrate that strength of conviction in the coming days. Let’s hope they understand that.

A one-man No show in Navan, and a ‘very close’ call in Tipperary

Highlight: In the run-up to this Friday’s referendum, we checked in with two TDs who are urging a No vote  as they pounded the pavements 
Body


On a bright sunny Thursday evening in Navan, Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín and four enthusiastic women, including his sister Noelle, are pounding the pavements of the Woodlands estate, knocking on doors and asking for residents to vote No in this Friday’s Eighth Amendment referendum.
“I think Meath is a bellwether constituency,” Tóibín says. “We’re a big commuter belt yet we have some rural areas as well. I would say if you get a No vote majority here, we’re gonna take the day.”
He’s speaking towards the end of what has been widely viewed as a good week for the No campaign. Last Monday a somewhat raucous television debate on Claire Byrne Live was seen as having boosted the No camp whose arguments found traction amidst the chaos and clapping in the RTÉ studio. Maria Steen, in particular, delivered an effective contribution that at various points undermined those arguments put forward by a hesitant Dr Peter Boylan who, until that point, had been the Yes side’s strongest campaigner.
Afterwards, Yes campaigners, up to and including the Taoiseach, complained about the rowdiness of the audience. There was “a lot of point-scoring”, Leo Varadkar said. His refusal to debate the question being put before the people is leading to unwelcome comparisons with Enda Kenny’s decision not to do any debates around his doomed proposition to abolish the Seanad five years ago.
But on the doors is where a tight campaign can be won and lost. In Tipperary, independent TD Mattie McGrath, who is campaigning for a No vote, said he was also picking up a distinct displeasure with the government over the CervicalCheck controversy in recent weeks.
He believes this will impact on the Yes campaign. “Their whole talk of compassion and care has been eroded completely by the whole ongoing scandal with the cervical cancer and the neglect and the cover-up and the whole lot,” McGrath said. “That’s coming up in the last two weeks, obviously. They don’t trust the government, they don’t trust politicians.”
Woodlands is a sleepy cul-de-sac on the outskirts of Navan town centre. It has an eclectic mix of families with young children, commuters, middle-aged and elderly couples. It has been said throughout the campaign that so sensitive is the abortion issue that it is difficult to engage voters on the doors. But as The Sunday Business Post accompanies Tóibín and his small canvass team around the west Meath housing estate we find many prospective voters willing to talk.
Tóibín is canvassing using literature from an organisation called Cherish all the Children Equally which draws heavily on those famous words from the Proclamation and describes itself as a “progressive, republican, pro-life movement”. The four-page leaflet carries a series of striking messages, including that the government is proposing an “extreme abortion regime” and that “the poor are far more likely to be aborted”. It raises the prospect of gender-selective abortions, an issue barely touched on by other pro-life organisations in this referendum.
“What the government is promising is abortion on demand. Most abortions will be for healthy babies of healthy mothers,” Tóibín tells an elderly woman at the first door he knocks on. She notes that at the moment “the woman is not protected”, but she takes a leaflet and we continue on.
[caption id="attachment_417035" align="alignleft" width="666"] Mattie McGrath at a Love Both press conference in Dublin[/caption]
Part of Tóibín’s pitch on the doorsteps is that he takes a different view from his party. He has been suspended from Sinn Féin in the past for voting against party policy on abortion, but this has not stopped him and fellow TD Carol Nolan in Offaly – who is currently suspended – from actively campaigning for a No vote.
At another door, former town clerk John O’Donoghue greets the Meath West TD with great enthusiasm, inviting him in for tea. “Our age would give the game away, so we’ll be definitely voting No,” O’Donoghue, who is nearly 70, says. “What’s making the argument for No people is you’ve people like Dr Boylan confused and when you have so-called experts who can’t agree, well then you’ve a problem.”
Tóibín, perhaps mindful of the need to be seen as loyal, points out that his party leader performed strongly in that TV debate last Monday: “Only for Mary Lou [McDonald], the Yes side would have been in trouble. She did add a bit of buttress to the debate.”
One of Tóibín’s other main arguments is that he believes the removal of the Eighth Amendment will disproportionately affect people from poorer or ethnic minority backgrounds. This is particularly interesting given the Yes campaign has made the argument that the current law disadvantages poorer women as only those who have the means to travel for an abortion can do so.
But at Bernadette Sheridan’s doorstep, Tóibín says: “With abortion, sometimes people who are poorer, who suffer from disabilities, even females, women and people from ethnic backgrounds can be discriminated against and I don’t think we as a people are good at diversity and once we start selecting the next generation we can start making mistakes.”
Sheridan, who is holding a baby girl in her arms, listens intently and says firmly at the end of the conversation that she will be voting No. Just as firm is an elderly man who is hard of hearing at another doorstep who, before Tóibín even has a chance to speak, declares: “I’m ultra-conservative so I’m voting No. I can’t help it because it’s built into me.”
Tóibín says that “issues like this are built into our DNA to a certain extent”, to which the man jokingly responds: “Brainwashed.”
Tóibín encounters more people voting No than Yes in this estate, but mother-of-two and repeal supporter Elaine Sherlock is keen to engage him in what transpires to be a compelling debate. “I believe women should choose, we should have power over our bodies,” she says somewhat nervously.
Undeterred, Tóibín says he agrees, insisting he “fully supports bodily autonomy” but he adds that “there are two bodies involved in a pregnancy” and makes many of the arguments he has made at other doorsteps. Sherlock remains unconvinced, saying: “The government trust me to make decisions for my kids from when they are born so why shouldn’t I have the right to make decisions for me and for them.
“I have two kids, I am not saying I ever want to be in a position of having to have an abortion but if my life was under threat why should my kids lose?”
As the debate goes back and forth, Tóibín says there are difficult cases but warns that the government is promising legislation that would allow for “abortion on demand”. The woman challenges him to outline what he thinks are the ‘hard cases’.
He lists rape and a pregnancy where there is an “inevitable death” of the unborn child, before adding: “But if someone said to me: ‘Peadar, you’re going to lose your life and it’s going to be legal’, I’d say: ‘That’s a hard case too.’ I think we shouldn’t be answering hard cases by creating thousands of other hard cases.”
Sherlock says the Constitution has to change for the hard cases to be dealt with. They discuss abortion rates in Canada but there is no convincing the young mother. Later, Tóibín remarks to his fellow canvassers that “her mind is settled”. Emer O’Connor, who is canvassing with Tóibín’s sister Noelle, asks: “And what was her reason? The autonomy thing, was it?”
O’Connor later says she believes that “free speech is gone out of this entire debate” and along with Noelle Tóibín they detail their various grievances with the media and their failure to focus on the recent decision by Google to withdraw all referendum-related advertising.
Bedecked in bright red Save the 8th hoodies, Louise Dunleavy and Joanne Smith both say they are scared to put stickers calling for a No vote on their car for fear their windows will be smashed.
Elsewhere on the estate, as one young man power-washes his car and expresses little interest in discussing the issue, Tóibín heads to the next door. Standing there is 39-year-old TJ Mackey, who is trying – and failing – to get his two young girls to go to bed. He is leaning towards Yes, but he is not fully convinced. “We don’t want it to be a case for it becoming a contraceptive,” he tells Tóibín. “There has to be a good reason for voting Yes.”
At another door, retiree Hillary Bartley is reluctant to say which way she is voting. “I think it’s my own business how I vote. I’ve thought about it, I’ve made up my mind and I shall vote on the day.”
But judging by her conversation with Tóibín she seems to be leaning towards Yes. “If I vote Yes, it’s not making people do things, it’s allowing people. They’re going to England anyway.” The conversation is good-natured and Bartley strays into other issues, raising her grievances over judges letting criminals out on bail. Tóibín talks about his Safer Meath campaign. “We are digressing,” Bartley says. “I’ve kind of made up my mind and I don’t like to be told what to do.”
There is a strong No vote – by a margin of around three-to-one – in this estate, judging by the doors The Sunday Business Post witnesses Tóibín knocking on. A bespectacled elderly lady, who doesn’t want to give her name, is an enthusiastic No voter and wonders aloud: “What happened to the others? What happened to Simon Coveney? Who got to him?”
Tóibín tells her of his concerns that people with disabilities will suffer most. “Then it’s my turn, I am not viable after medication,” she responds. The TD also notes there is a lot of pressure in political parties. He knows that only too well. Speaking after the canvass, he admits it’s “a difficult situation” to be at odds with most of his Sinn Féin colleagues.
“I have a lot of good comrades, good colleagues. On this issue, it would be difficult for them to see me in a polar opposite direction than they are,” he says. “That’s the difficulty, but in the whole scheme of things . . . people have said: ‘Are you not worried you’d lose your job?’
“If I lose my job, it’s not the end of the world for me. The sun will rise the next day – and hopefully we’ll have something to eat as well – but I really believe that if this law is introduced, for a considerable cohort of people every year it will be the end of the world for them.”
Down in Tipperary, Mattie McGrath has no issues with party affiliation, and says the campaign has been going better than he had expected. “The weather is favourable for canvassing, people are starting to focus and the No vote is strong,” he says.
McGrath says he finds Yes campaigners unwilling to engage which is perhaps no surprise given his national profile as an outspoken advocate against repeal.
“They say ‘I am Yes, full stop’ and they don’t want to debate with you, they don’t like you but they won’t debate, they won’t discuss the 12 weeks, they just discuss the hard cases.”
He says it has been particularly hard to convince some men of the importance of the issue. “We find with men in their sixties and seventies, they think it’s not their issue,” he says, adding that these people are likely to either not vote or vote No.
Predictably, he forecasts a majority will vote No in Tipperary. “It’s very open, wide open,” he says. “It’ll be very close.”

Accountability should be a basic function of high office

Length: 947 words
Byline: Elaine Byrne
Highlight: With Oireachtas committees, the political instinct veers towards scoring points rather than getting answers 
Body


The minority government is two years old. In that time, Leo Varadkar’s administration has been rocked on two occasions by two separate controversies that go to the very heart of how governance is conducted in this country.
The Frances Fitzgerald resignation and the shameful Vicky Phelan scandal both dramatically escalated as issues because of the non-disclosure of emails by government departments and agencies.
The basic premise of accountability is answerability, the obligation to inform and the acknowledgment of responsibility. The repeated non-disclosure of fundamental information by branches of the government hinders and obstructs this primal function of public office.
When the public is not told what by right it should know, it creates a tsunami of anger that gathers unstoppable momentum. To his ultimate cost, the former HSE chief Tony O’Brien described this public outpouring of exasperation as “hysteria”.
First example. In November last year, the confidence and supply agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil was faltering as a looming no-confidence motion in the Dáil brought Ireland to the brink of a general election. The country almost went to the polls because of goddamn emails.
This correspondence was “missed” by the Department of Justice in its first trawl of documents for the Disclosures Tribunal into the alleged smear campaign against Garda whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe. The emails only came to light in response to parliamentary questions. The saga resulted in the Taoiseach inadvertently misleading the Dáil twice in seven days because of this incomplete information from the department.
The dramatic last-minute resignation of Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald, in the “national interest”, averted an imminent election.
A senior counsel was tasked with carrying out an investigation into why the Department of Justice failed to initially forward these emails to Judge Charleton at the Disclosures Tribunal. The 39-page report by Michael Collins was published in March and concluded “a degree of common sense” was needed when it came to the sharing of emails with the Disclosures Tribunal.
The failure to disclose emails spawned a mammoth national crisis and the resignations of the Minister of Justice and the secretary-general of the justice department. An expensive exercise to discover the meaning of common sense.
That email episode decidedly ended Leo Varadkar’s honeymoon period as Taoiseach. The cervical cancer screening scandal has served to further damage his government.
The government has been blamed for accountability failures within the health sector. As with the McCabe saga, the non-disclosure of emails was a feature of the HSE catastrophe.
The Public Accounts Committee succeeded in getting documents the Minister for Health did not have. The committee did a national service in forcing into the public domain the three memos on what the HSE was told in 2016 about the cervical screening audit findings. To date, it is the only public accountability achieved in this debacle.
The PAC’s actions compelled Simon Harris to order a trawl of documents in the HSE and the Department of Health to ensure all information is made available to the Scally inquiry.
Trawls of emails are becoming a regular feature of public scandals.
However, this sterling work by the PAC was undermined by the unseemly turf war between the Oireachtas committees over the ownership of investigating the CervicalCheck controversy.
It was deeply uncomfortable to listen to the PAC slug it out over the national airwaves over which committee should examine the scandal.
It was pathetic and a gross display of political immaturity. It does nothing to help promote trust in public life.
It was left to the chair of the government-appointed scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck scandal to intervene. The British public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally issued a public warning that “individuals are being distracted” by these parallel investigations.
Many politicians are driven by the desire to seek publicity, to chase headlines and to get their soundbite on the Six One News. The “gotcha” culture of PAC was particularly exposed during last year’s hearings with Nóirín O’Sullivan and the financial irregularities at the Garda training college in Templemore.
Ten of the 13 members of PAC publicly stated that the then Garda Commissioner should resign – before they had heard what she had to say.
It appears that Oireachtas committees have long abandoned the constitutional principle of due process in favour of political opportunism. The long-term cost of this behaviour may well be non-cooperation by civil servants and executives of government agencies when it comes to appearing before such committees. This would be a disaster for parliamentary democracy and public accountability.
There is no legal obligation to appear before a committee. The public admonishment for not appearing may be outweighed by the sacrifice of personal and professional reputations on the altar of political opportunism.
The Health Committee and PAC need to step back and let the Scally inquiry do its work. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission must step in and impose decisions about how committees are run in order to maintain the integrity of the Oireachtas.
It is not about politicians; it is about all the Vicky Phelans out there whose lives have been so traumatically impacted by the failure of accountability.
“I am not interested in revenge. That is not what I am here for,” the Limerick mother-of-two with terminal cancer told the PAC on Wednesday.
“I want to see accountability and I would like to see a legacy that this will never happen again to any woman, man or child in this country.”

Highlight: Marion McKeone visits the National Rifle Association’s annual conference in Dallas to get a taste of all-American patriot culture in its rawest form: an irony-free zone where the deadliest of weapons are packaged like children’s toys 
Body


Welcome to the National Rifle Association’s annual general meeting in downtown Dallas. A 15-acre jamboree of ‘friends, faith, family, firearms and the flag’. Especially the flag. The Stars and Stripes have been contorted into all shapes, sizes and textures: incorporated into tattoos, body art, underwear, outer wear, eye wear and onto assault weapons, pistols, handguns, ammunition, accessories and combat gear. The flag has been fashioned into earrings, nativist slogans, fear-mongering flak jackets and thousands of other items which it’s safe to say the Founding Fathers never contemplated.
The NRA annual meeting’s exhibition space is surprisingly accessible. Anyone with a $25 membership can wander in, peruse the 800-plus exhibitions of guns, ammunition and a bewildering array of gun accessories. In addition, tickets to all the main events – keynote addresses by Donald Trump and Mike Pence, legislative brainstorming events, a crash course in gun laws, admission to the membership forum and charity lunches, dinners and other events - can all be purchased online for relatively modest sums of money.
The only persons categorically disinvited are the “foreign media”. However, such a ban is easily circumvented with the purchase of a temporary $25 membership. Which also provides you with a four-inch knife bearing the logo ‘NRA’ on one side and the legend ‘Made in China’ on the other.
The NRA, the last bastion of all-American red-blooded patriotism, is a confusing, contrary and contradictory place to spend four days. By turns friendly and (possibly unintentionally) menacing, it’s a completely irony-free zone. Its members are earnest: deadly earnest, in fact. One sign exhorts attendees to sign up for gun enthusiast holidays. Its unique selling point is handwritten in black marker: “$4,400 to shoot six large animals. Kids under 18 months are free.”
But there are other ways to amuse oneself than taking aim at toddlers. Attendees can attend a prayer breakfast. Or a book signing by Oliver North. Or stomp their way through a Charlie Daniels concert. Or show off their shooting skills at one of dozens of temporary shooting ranges. Guns are variously packaged as toys, must-have accessories and the last stand between America and tyranny.
But unless you’re going on a gun-buying splurge, it’s also a surprisingly inexpensive way to while away a few days. Exhibitors hand out a bewildering array of cheap swag, from $1 bumper stickers (‘A Lady With A Gun Has A Lot More Fun’) to coffee cups to $7 T-shirts with NRA slogans. The overexposed English mantra ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ has been abbreviated to ‘Keep Calm and Carry’ beneath a silhouette of a gun. Food choices are uncomplicated: they are reheated, processed, beige and under $5.
The atmosphere is friendly, festive and giddy with the exultation of shipwreck survivors who have reached a safe harbour, but regard themselves as increasingly under siege. After a few hours in the company of NRA members, their codes become easy to discern. “Immigrants” is a catch-all phrase that describes blacks, Hispanics, illegal immigrants, potential terrorists and actual criminals. It’s an acceptable one-word slur to describe all non-whites, regardless of their origin or citizen status.
In the US, around 77 per cent of the population now favours more stringent gun control laws. Towns in gun enthusiast states like Colorado are ‘turning traitor’: Boulder City Council, for example, is in the process of passing a ban on assault weapons. And those pesky teenage survivors from the Parkland school shooting in Florida show no sign of going away - their #NeverAgain movement is threatening to make gun control a mid-term election issue.
For decades, the NRA successfully made opposition to gun control laws a litmus test for candidates. Now the Parkland survivors’ movement is doing the opposite. Being in favour of gun control could help candidates win seats in some districts where, four years ago, such a controversial position would have guaranteed defeat.
But for four days, NRA members and Second Amendment defenders want to relax, have some fun and become reacquainted with old friends. For a community who perceive themselves as being under siege like never before, there is a real comfort in being among what they describe as “like-minded Americans”. They are alike in dress, too – walking NRA and Donald Trump billboards. Every visible piece of flesh, every inch of their clothing is covered in NRA and Trump logos, badges and slogans and icons.
The majority of attendees appear to be middle-aged to elderly white males and their pistol-packing Stepford wives. But the event is also, I’m informed by one group of twentysomething men who’ve travelled from Michigan, a perfect setting for a stag party. Not just because of all the ancillary events and male bonding over Uzis and pitcher of beers, but because the event is also a magnet to young, single, conservative Christian women looking for a husband.
Certainly, there seems to be a surprising number of young women in attendance. Whether this is because of a targeted NRA outreach, or because of the opportunity for some away-game mischief, is unclear. Some of the women say they’re there out of curiosity, or to brush up on their shooting skills. Others cheerfully describe themselves as “bullet bunnies” and “range rats”, even NRA groupies.
Families, many with toddlers and babies sleeping peacefully in pushchairs, marvel at brands of bullets that promise to pulverise human organs on contact. One father patiently explains the differences between a C-39 assault weapon and a Ruger 10/22 to his pre-school son. Another explains at length the sort of injury a scald from hot coffee can inflict on flesh, as he and his three children line up to get free coffee samples in eggcup-sized paper cups. You can’t help but wonder if he’s as careful in schooling them on the damage an AR-15 can inflict; an average of 19 American children a day are killed or injured by gun violence. The statistics on death from coffee burns are unknown.

The typical profile of an NRA member is someone who is white, overweight and under siege. A cursory glance at the age profile suggests that this is an event that could be in danger of ageing out.
This perception is reinforced by an exhaustive study on gun ownership in the US, conducted in 2015 by Harvard and NorthEastern Universities. It showed that fewer young men are buying guns, and that gun ownership - like wealth - in the US is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small percentage of white males, just 3 per cent of whom own more than 40 per cent of all guns in circulation in the US. In other words, fewer people are buying more guns.
An estimated 7.7 million gun ‘super-owners’ own around 140 million guns between them. Women and super-owners are the NRA and the firearms industry’s future. The number of young males buying guns has dropped by about 10 per cent; the overall number of Americans who own guns has dropped by about 3 per cent.
Minorities – blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic groups – own far fewer guns than white Americans. Despite these statistics, the NRA and its members have bought into a silent conspiracy that is built on an unspoken fear; that black Americans will rise up against white America, and that white America had better be prepared to defend itself. This is alluded to by giant posters that line the 15-acre exhibition space, darkly warning of “terror” and “tyranny”, and urging “warriors” to arm up and “defend themselves” against “the coming threat”.
The only black man I encounter in the building on Saturday afternoon – aside from the catering staff and janitors that are manning the restaurants and the toilets – is Sheriff David Clarke, who is peddling his book on Saturday afternoon. There is a queue of about 60 or so people in line – mainly women. Clark is tall, lean and handsome. He exudes confidence, charisma and reactionary politics.
As middle-aged matrons line up to have their photos taken with him – he’s shifting a lot more selfies than copies of his new book – the men watch their female partners with wary expressions on their faces. “We have no problem with black folk who think like us,” Terry Randal, an attendee from Arizona, says. “He’s on our side.”
Later in the day, half a dozen black shooting instructors from Philadelphia create a stir when they arrive wearing Black Guns Matter T-shirts. At first, they are regarded with suspicion, even hostility. But they are not here to protest. Rather, they are concerned teaching black communities how to safely handle and store guns. Even when it becomes apparent that they are paid-up NRA members and gun enthusiasts, eyebrows are raised and white hands inch towards concealed carry weapons as they make their way through the exhibition centre.
On Friday, the place is feverish with anticipation. It’s “leave your gun at home” day, because Donald Trump will be in the building. Thousands of NRA members stand patiently in line, stopping only to check in their knives under the instructions of the Secret Service. I chat with dozens of attendees, including two elderly men, one of whom leans heavily on a walking stick. They are genial, polite and fervent Trump supporters. They insist that I sit beside them. They are so friendly and welcoming that I accept.
But once we’re through the metal detectors and inside the arena, the atmosphere changes. It’s as though Superman went into a phone box and came out as Lex Luthor. Chris Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, comes on stage to warm up the crowd. “Now shush and listen up,” one commands.
Cox reminds the crowd that Trump “defeated Hillary Clinton”. It’s an interesting choice of words; what is important is not that Trump won the election, but that he stopped Clinton from becoming president. Predictably, the declaration is met with a thunderous roar of approval. “Trump that BITCH,” my elderly and previously infirm new friend roars at full throttle, springing to his feet, his walking stick cast to one side. It’s as if Lazarus rose from the dead, cranked up on methamphetamines.
But, contrary to stereotypes, not all NRA members are frothing-at-the-mouth white supremacists charging full-tilt towards an imaginary race war. Larry Barnard is a 52-year-old hunter from north-west Pennsylvania. “I’m here because I believe in the Second Amendment,” he says. “I believe that all law-abiding people should have the right to bear arms. I have maybe a dozen guns. I’ve got seven, eight long guns, but I don’t use assault weapons. You don’t hunt with an assault weapon. No self-respecting hunter would use an assault weapon to hunt. It’s . . .” He pauses and shakes his head.
Barnard, like several other middle-aged NRA members I speak to, is dismayed that the NRA, which he says used to be a membership group for hunters, has become the mouthpiece of white supremacists and bigots and has inserted itself into the extreme end of right-wing politics. “We weren’t going to come this year,” he says, gesturing to his friends. “But then we thought: are we just going let these guys take it over and push us out? The hell we are!”
A lifelong Republican, Barnard resents how Fox News “has kind of taken over everything”, a reference to North’s role as a Fox News pundit and the presence of Fox News host Tucker Carlson as one of this year’s headliners. “I don’t see what politics has to do with us.”
[caption id="attachment_416671" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Donald Trump jr and sr; Chris Cox, executive director, NRA-ILA; and Wayne LaPierre, executive vice-president, NRA, greet the crowd at the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum during the NRA Annual Meeting & Exhibits in Dallas Pic: Getty[/caption]
By the time Trump arrives in Dallas, his sidekick Mike Pence is already on stage, eulogising him to cheers and standing ovations. It’s the first time that both a sitting president and vice-president have addressed the annual meeting.
Pence’s pledges to the five Fs – faith, family, friends, the flag and firearms - goes down well. But there’s no mistaking why the crowd is here: to reconnect with Trump and to hear him renew his vows with the organisation.
After positioning himself as the undisputed champion of gun rights, Trump appeared to be flirting with gun control measures in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting last February. He even went so far as to accuse Republican lawmakers who quailed at the idea of raising the legal age to purchase an assault weapon of “being afraid of the NRA”.
For a brief moment, it seemed as though the candidate who had cashed their $30 million cheque had abandoned them. But it transpires that Trump needs the NRA as much as the NRA needs him.
Like Trump, the NRA has come under unprecedented pressure in recent months. The upsurge of the #NeverAgain movement in the wake of Parkland, growing public support for gun control and revelations that the NRA had been accepting funds from Russia have all triggered unwelcome media scrutiny.
And, like Trump, the NRA is also the subject of an FBI investigation concerning secret donations from Russian donors, and in particular its relationship with Aleksandr Torshin, a Russian billionaire and NRA member with ties to the Kremlin and (it has been alleged) Russian organised crime. Questions are looming about how much of the NRA’s $30 million came from Russia.
During the four days of the NRA gathering, a double-sided mobile billboard circles the giant Kay Bailey Hutchison Conference Centre in downtown Dallas, with giant pictures of Vladimir Putin and Wayne LaPierre beaming in each other’s direction. Atop the pictures is a caption asking why the NRA has “cozied up” to Putin and the Kremlin.
It’s a reference to increasing questions about the funds the NRA allegedly received from Torshin over the past two years, money that was allegedly funnelled into its $54 million election war chest. The FBI is investigating whether the Kremlin illegally moved money to the NRA to help the Trump campaign in 2016, and NRA lawyers are currently poring over documents that relate to Torshin as preparation for possibly awkward questions.
Notwithstanding the slump in gun sales that Trump’s presidency has contributed to, American gun manufacturers still feel they owe him a huge debt of gratitude. After all, his tax plan ensures they keep an estimated $120 million more of their profits. Trump giveth and Trump taketh.
And so, as a token of its gratitude, Cabot Guns has unveiled what its NRA exhibition stand marketing blurb describes as “the Rolls-Royce of firearms”: a $50,000 24-carat, gold-plated, limited-edition pistol called the Donald Trump 45.
The trigger is made from a four-billion-year-old meteorite. All the better to symbolise the “meteoric success of the Trump presidency”. (Don’t ask them how they know its age. I did, and it nearly got me chucked out of the exhibition centre).
With “Trump 45” engraved on one side and “45th President of the United States” on the other, it’s the ultimate metaphor for a victim/aggressor organisation and its belligerent but aggrieved hero. This could be an art installation, a cultural snapshot of the US in 2018, so perfectly does it encapsulate the Trump era without a shred of irony.
At the other end of the spectrum is ageing rocker and NRA board member Ted Nugent’s new range; ‘the ‘Spearchucker’ assault weapon series. The name comes from an obscure racial slur. Nugent, 69, formerly of the Birther movement, fronted the Amboy Dukes in the 1960s before going solo. His 15 minutes of fame have long since expired, but he shows no inclination to get off the stage, although he resorts to increasingly desperate measures to prove his supposed relevance.
[caption id="attachment_416674" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] A custom ‘Trump 45’ handgun costs a cool $50,000 Pic: Getty[/caption]
Most recently, Nugent hit the headlines when he described the Parkland high school students who survived the mass shooting and founded the #NeverAgain movement as “liars” and people who “have no soul”. But he’s one of the undisputed stars of the NRA gathering. He pops up everywhere, even offering himself up at the aforementioned $250-a-plate ladies’ lunch auction. The highest bidder gets to spend the day with him at his ranch in Waco, shooting squirrels and other critters.
The other NRA star in the making is Oliver North, the man at the centre of the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s. North was elected NRA president a fortnight ago after its current incumbent, Pete Brownell, stepped down “to focus on the family business”. NRA gossip suggests Brownell was forced out because of his failure to take a sufficiently hardline stance against the Parkland activists.
One of the stranger things about the NRA is how quick its members are to cast aside the flak jacket and don the mantle of victimhood. North is the perfect choice for where the organisation is headed: an ageing white man experiencing an improbable second act.
While the NRA insists its membership exceeds five million, North seems to think the membership is about 3.5 million. Or else he’s not very good at maths. He tells the crowd that if every NRA member recruits just one person to join the organisation, that will increase the membership to seven million. And if they each recruit one person (which means 3.5 million will have to recruit two persons) the membership will grow to 14 million.
But in a brief conversation that I have with North, snatched during his book signing, he suggests the NRA has six million members. What he meant was that if the current five million members recruit another million members, it will reach seven. And then if each of those recruits a member, it will reach 14 million. And presumably, if they each recruit ten people . . . well, before you know it, the entire country will be NRA members. Twice over.
For his part, North has promised to use his contacts to recruit some old buddies from his military days. The sort who secretly – and illegally - sold guns to Iran in the 1980s to fund the barbaric dirty war perpetrated by the Contras to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing government in Nicaragua. He also, incidentally, persuaded his secretary Fawn Hall to stuff classified documents into her knickers to smuggle them out of a Congressional office.
But never mind all that, and the fact that Iran, once North’s banker, is now Trump’s bête noire. North did his 1,200 hours of community service for his Iran-Contra sins, and now he’s ready for duty once again. Still looking surprisingly boyish at 74, he retains the erect military posture and the staccato delivery of someone who has important intelligence to deliver in a hurry.
Under North’s stewardship, the NRA will ramp up its belt-and-braces approach towards blocking any form of gun control, or indeed any responsibility for the unfettered nativism or fearmongering by its advocates and defenders who dominate US talk radio.
Guns don’t kill people; people kill people, North says. Even Steve Scalise, the congressman who was shot and almost fatally injured during a baseball game in Washington DC last year, makes a special appearance via video link to reinforce this message, while Mike Pence gripes that no one talks about the heroes who risk their lives to save the victims of mass shootings.
Indeed. They only talk about the dozens of innocent people felled by a man with a grudge and an assault weapon. This is an irony-free refrain of the NRA disciples: gun control activists only talk about the people who were killed.
You’d think Scalise, who is still recovering from his injuries, might favour a spot of gun control, given his experience. Not a bit of it. He is slurping enthusiastically on the NRA Kool-Aid: the only way to stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun.
It’s the go-to NRA response for shootings. You can’t blame a talk show host - or a political leader, for that matter - if their hate-fuelled rhetoric incites someone else to violence. In both cases, they’re just availing of their constitutionally protected rights, as laid out clearly in the First and Second Amendments.
NRA supporters are constitutional literalists. When you suggest to them that the Second Amendment right to bear arms was written back in 1791 to facilitate musket-toting local militias, not machine gun-wielding mass killers, they will point out that the Founding Fathers (for whom they have an unabashed reverence) granted the right to bear whatever arms were available. The musket of 1791 is the AR-15 of today.
About five minutes’ walk from the convention centre is Dealey Plaza, the site of US president John F Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963. The Book Store Depository on the sixth floor has been turned into a museum that is both chilling and absorbing. Visitors can look on from the exact spot where Lee Harvey Oswald took aim at JFK. On the road beneath, a simple X is painted on the spot where Kennedy was killed.
[caption id="attachment_416675" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Oliver North, the NRA’s new president, addresses its Leadership Forum in Dallas Pic: Getty[/caption]
The area is packed with NRA attendees, who stage impromptu re-enactments and ponder whether, in fact, Oswald might not have taken the fatal shot. There are detailed forensic discussions about bullet types, trajectories, the gun used. The gun experts are troubled by the ballistics - in particular, by the fact that there was so little impact on the bullet.
Dealey Plaza is, of course, a shine for Democrats and Kennedy worshippers. At times, there are awkward collisions of opposing views. “One man with a gun changed our history. Exhibit A for gun control,” remarks a woman who stands with her husband looking at archives from the assassination.
“Well, that depends entirely on your perspective,” a middle-aged man wearing an NRA admission badge retorts. With those words, he conveys that he thinks the shooting of JFK is an argument against gun control, not for it.
For a moment, the air seems to crystallise with tension. The woman and her husband look at him in silence.
“You have a real nice day, sir,” the husband says as he and his wife turn on their heels and walk away.
Last year was a dismal one for gun sales in the US, and 2018 isn’t looking much better. Earlier this year, Sturm Ruger, one of the US’s biggest gun manufacturers, said its net sales had fallen by 22 per cent during 2017, and profits fell by more than one-third. Earlier this year, Remington, the US’s oldest and most iconic gun maker, declared bankruptcy.
The reason? The presidency of Donald Trump. The NRA’s biggest champion is also the firearms industry’s biggest threat.
Second Amendment defenders are contrary creatures. The gun industry as a whole has experienced a steep decline in sales and profits in the US since Trump’s election. Firearms manufacturers enjoyed record sales during the Barack Obama years and 2016 was another good one, as gun enthusiasts, believing Hillary Clinton would be the next president of the United States, embarked on a buying spree.
Ironically for the NRA and the US firearms manufacturers, there’s nothing better for business than a Democrat in the White House. Except perhaps one who has the support of a Democratic-controlled Congress. The NRA needs a bogeyman, or bogeywoman - and the prospect of President Hillary Clinton was poised to send gun sales through the roof. To hear the NRA exhibitors whinge in Dallas, you’d think she’d lost the election to spite them.
With Trump in the White House – and Mike Pence waiting in the wings – the chance that any gun control legislation will be introduced is zero. For the foreseeable future, the NRA and its members can rest assured that the government will not try to limit the type or number of guns Americans can own. So there is no urgency, no compelling reason to stockpile weapons.
The same was true during the Bush administration, when gun sales dropped to three million a year. During the Obama years, they peaked at 11 million. That’s a 360 per cent increase in sales. And now they’re down again. Even the Parkland shooting in Florida last February, which triggered the powerful #NeverAgain movement by student survivors, failed to deliver the anticipated uptick in sales of assault weapons. Likewise with the October 2017 Las Vegas massacre which claimed the lives of 58 concert-goers.
[caption id="attachment_416673" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] An attendee shops at the NRA store in the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention in Dallas, Texas Pic: Getty[/caption]
When Obama was president, a mass shooting was, paradoxically, a boon for gun manufacturers. After every mass shooting, sales would spike as gun owners, fearing Obama would find a way to restrict their access to guns, splurged on assault weapons.
The first quarter of 2013 – the three months following the Sandy Hook massacre of 18 primary schoolchildren and seven of their teachers – set new records in gun sales. Assault weapons sold out of gun stores across the country as Second Amendment advocates stocked up ahead of an anticipated ban on assault weapons that failed to materialise.
The stock exchange also reflects this trend. After the deaths of 14 people in a shooting in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, America Outdoor Brands’ stock surged by 25 per cent. After a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, the stock jumped by 14 per cent. But after the Parkland massacre, the stock price of American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger fell by more than 6 per cent after Dick’s Sporting Goods, which sells their firearms, said it would permanently halt the sale of assault-style rifles like the AR-15 and high-capacity magazines.
But even in a slump, guns are still big business in the US. Estimates of number of firearms in circulation in the US vary between 265 and 315 million. In its 2018 report’s economic impact assessment, the National Shooting Sports Foundation claims that the firearms and ammunition industry adds $51.4 billion to the US economy each year.
It also claims that companies in the US that manufacture, distribute and sell firearms, ammunition and hunting equipment employ almost 150,000 people, and generate an additional 161,795 jobs in supplier and ancillary industries. It also points out that the firearms and ammunition industry generated $6.78 billion in tax revenue during 2017.
Industry research analysts like IBISWorld suggest the figures are more modest: that the gun manufacturing industry generated $17 billion in revenue and employs 50,730 people directly. It notes, however, that the firearms industry currently generates $2 billion a year in online sales alone.

It seems that the NRA has cottoned on to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement. Sort of.
With the greying-out of NRA members and fewer young men showing an inclination to join its ranks, the NRA is targetting a hitherto overlooked demographic; women.
The organisation has taken to the outdated marketing mantra of ‘pink it and shrink it’, rather late in the day. And very literally. The prettifying of guns and gun accessories is a big part of its appeal to young women, as is its overhaul of its representation of women as powerful, fearless creatures. It’s like a collision between Barbie and Lara Croft. Confusing to say the least.
A wander around the ‘women’s section’ in the exhibition hall suggests you might have wandered into a particularly tacky sex toy section in an adult entertainment shop. In the Bling Sting section, all manner of self-defence products – from handguns to cans of Mace, pepper spray, personal alarms, whistles, have been encased in phallic-shaped containers, dipped in lurid shades of pink and encased in rhinestones and glitter. Talk about mixed messages.
Elsewhere, vouchers for classes with female shooting instructors are discounted or offered free with purchases of $500 or more. “Honey, your boyfriend is about the worst gun instructor you could possibly have. I don’t care if he’s an army sniper,” a grey-haired woman in a pink sweater advises a twentysomething female who is purchasing a pink Beretta 92FS low recoil handgun as if it’s a two-day- old puppy.
At almost every exhibitors’ stand, gun manufacturers have customised assault weapons, rifles and handguns to make them more attractive to women. Kel Tec handguns now come in Barbie pink. The Ar-15 rifle manufacturers have brought a range in pink purple and blue camouflage.
Susan LaPierre, wife of NRA executive vice-president Wayne LaPierre, is very much at the forefront. La Pierre, an impeccably groomed Christie Brinkley lookalike with an extravagant mane of blonde hair, is omnipresent, flitting from one female target-shooting competition to another, urging the competitors on.
“Go flex those Second Amendment muscles, gals,” she trills.
The NRA has added four female members to its board for this year, LaPierre announces at the Women’s Leadership Forum Lunch, which was attended by around 1,200 women. “When we started this 12 years ago we didn’t even have 100 women,” she marvels.
The event is billed as a ‘fundraising and philanthropy’ event where tickets cost $250 a head. A silent auction is conducted. Taste-no-object items like gold gun pendants, shooting lessons, highly impractical looking crystal encrusted handguns and other pinked up gun accessories are snapped up.
Washed-up 1970s rock star and gun nut Ted Nugent puts himself up for auction, inviting “a lucky lady” to pay for the privilege of spending a day with him at his Texas ranch, “shootin’ duck and the like”. In the end, he agrees to take the losing bidder along for the ride too. When you win, you lose, in NRA Ladyland. And when you lose, you lose bigger.
Everywhere, giant images of ‘warrior women’ abound. Superwoman-style, impossibly tall, lean models, clad in camisoles and combat trousers, carry AR-15s on their shoulders and handguns strapped to their thighs. Their abundant blonde hair is artfully dishevelled, and they face the camera with a steely “don’t mess with me” stare.
The NRA and the firearms industry sees the female market as its best hope for the future. While male membership of the NRA has declined by about 10 per cent in the past two decades, female membership has grown by about a third over the past five years.
True, this still only represents an increase from 8 to 12 per cent of the total NRA membership. But NRA executives see potential for more growth, particularly if they keep cranking up the fear factor. In the US in 2016, there were 95,703 reported rapes, a 20 per cent increase on the number reported two years previously.
With the rise of the #MeToo movement, women’s rights advocates say the number of rapes and incidents of sexual assault reported during 2018 is expected to increase, as women become less fearful of the consequences of pursuing their attackers through the criminal justice system.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey claims there were 1.3 million incidents of sexual assault in 2013, and that one in four women and girls in the US had experienced sexual violence. Data from the FBI, which gathers its statistics on rape or attempted rape from local law enforcement, puts the number of reported rapes in the US at 82,109 for the same year.
Most law enforcement and women’s groups agree that rape is still grossly under-reported, and the chances of a rapist being apprehended, charged and convicted are put somewhere at around 6 in 1,000.
This is where the NRA has found its niche. While it sidesteps the issue of domestic violence, it is marketing guns as the best way women can protect themselves against rapists. This marketing ploy ignores the fact that most sexual assailants are known to their victims. NRA blurb portrays sexual predators as sinister masked figures who lie in wait in underground carparks and in the victims’ homes.
Sex sells, for sure. But fear sells even better.

Retail group BWG will sell off part of its newly approved acquisition of 4 Aces, the Portlaoise-based convenience wholesaler, as part of the conditions of the deal getting approval.
Competition watchdog the CCPC sought a commitment from Spar and Mace owner BWG that it would dispose of 4 Aces’ shareholding of Stonehouse Marketing as one of the binding conditions of it clearing the deal.
The firm 4 Aces Wholesale Limited is a wholesaler-franchiser engaged in wholesale operating mainly in the Leinster area. It has three cash-and-carry outlets in Portlaoise, Navan and Clonmel.
It supplies the Gala convenience stores across the midlands region and other convenience stores in that area with a customer base of around 1,500 stores.
With roots going back to the early 1960s, Stonehouse is an independent wholesale company with a network of 24 member companies and 30 warehouses nationwide. The group employs over 1,000 staff.
In the course of its investigation into the BWG deal to buy 4 Aces the CCPC identified a competition concern in relation to access to competitively sensitive information from 4 Ace’s relationship with Stonehouse Marketing and Gala Retail Services.
It sought a commitment that BWG would dispose of 4 Ace’s shareholding in Stonehouse and it also sought a firewall and confidentiality commitment to prevent the exchange of commercially sensitive information after the transaction.
The 4 Aces company employs around 85 people and has sales of in the region of €57.5 million and profits of around €440,000. Former owners Liam Linden and Pascal O’Brien will continue to run the business for BWG.
With sales of €1.4 billion, BWG is the umbrella group for Spar, Eurospar, Mace, Londis and XL stores.

In almost any other company, the presentation Michael Doorly delivered to shareholders of Independent News & Media last Friday would have instilled confidence about its future.
The chief executive told the audience how INM’s strategy was being influenced by the unprecedented changes facing the media industry. The company, though, with more than €90 million of cash in the bank, could cope with the challenges it faced and thrive. There would be investment in the core business of INM and new areas too.
With the help of consultants from EY, Doorly has developed a three-year strategy for INM and presented the details of it to shareholders. It was a well-rehearsed script, with sentences peppered with management-consultant speak.
“The first step was to focus on purpose, to define what we are about, our raison d’être,” Doorly said. That would be a “mechanism to guide and inform strategic decisions”.
“It provides a north star to motivate stakeholders, enhance employee engagement and increase shareholder value, through improving productivity through customer centricity,” he added.
It’s doubtful whether any of these buzzwords would pass muster for the pages of an INM title, but it’s pretty standard management-consultant philosophy. For a hefty fee, consultants will tell you to do what you do a little bit better, do it more efficiently and find a few more gaps in the market.
The few dozen shareholders sitting in the Westbury Hotel on Friday morning applauded the strategic options for INM’s future delivered by Doorly.
However, INM faces an even greater threat than the flight of advertising money to Google and Facebook and readers to the likes of Buzzfeed. The biggest threat to its future is the battle it is waging in the courts to prevent the state’s corporate enforcement watchdog, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), to have inspectors appointed to investigate serious allegations of everything from data protection breaches to potentially overpaying for Newstalk, and much more.
The company’s recently appointed chairman, Murdoch MacLennan, said in his opening remarks to the agm: “The board is, however, gravely concerned that the appointment of an inspector to INM would have a significantly damaging impact on the company and all its stakeholders, including its shareholders, employees, members of its pensions schemes, readers and customers.
“In considering its legal strategy, the board is acutely conscious that the appointment of inspectors to INM would by necessity result in a very considerable ongoing cost to INM and a continuing requirement to devote substantial resources to dealing with the inspectorate.”
There will be no time for management to plan for the future because their day-to-day activities will be consumed with dealing with the inspectors. And if the inspectors are appointed, there are very few limits to their powers. Any investigation could drag on for years, draining time and even more precious cash.
The formal part of the agm passed smoothly for Doorly and MacLennan (a seasoned executive who ran the Daily Telegraph for more than a decade), with few shareholders asking probing questions about the threat the current scandal presents to INM.
There may have been no open revolt by shareholders and the meeting passed off easily enough for the board, but institutional investors have privately raised their concerns about what is happening. “Some have expressed concern and, so far, they are very satisfied that we are addressing the business issues,” MacLennan said after the meeting ended when surrounded by journalists seeking more details about the ODCE’s move.
Had he spoken to Denis O’Brien, INM’s largest shareholder and a person who looms large in all that has happened in the last 18 months or so?
“I am not able to talk about any of that. I’m happy to talk to shareholders at any time. I haven’t contacted many shareholders at this stage.
“I have no problem talking to any number of shareholders. But I am not going to discuss this at this time.”
What those shareholders who did raise concerns want to know is how much this will all cost INM and how the company could get out of it.
The company’s coffers may be flush with cash right now, but how long that lasts when the legal bills are clocking up is another thing. Having said earlier this year that if the inspectors were appointed it would have a material impact, MacLennan demurred when pressed.
“We’re not into commenting on something that’s tied up in this legal process,” he said. “And it is very frustrating that we can’t tell you anything about it, because we have been asked not to. We just don’t know how long that will last, or how much it will cost. I would love to ringfence it.”
And that is part of the company’s problem. Analysts who cover INM point to the cash as the key reason why its share price hasn’t fallen further, given the risks posed by the threat of inspectors being appointed. What are the prospects of getting that cash back in the form of a dividend or share buyback when the legal bills are unknown and could escalate rapidly? No white knight will ride to the rescue with unknown liabilities hanging over INM.
All Doorly’s plans - from investing in digital content and creating paid-for content - are contingent on having access to that cash. What management consultants can’t model for is what will happen if the court rejects INM’s argument that inspectors shouldn’t be sent in.
As a media organisation, INM relies on trust more than most other companies: trust in its products and its people. Its reputation has been torn apart since the ODCE filed that now-infamous affidavit in late March. As a publicly quoted company, it also needs the confidence of investors.
Doorly and MacLennan presented a united front at the agm that, despite the difficulties, the company has a clear future ahead of it.
Their decision to sit side by side on Friday was a contrast to last year’s meeting that exposed the rift between the then chairman Leslie Buckley and then chief executive Robert Pitt. For all that, though, these are still very dangerous times for INM.
Colette Sexton spoke to Michael Doorly, chief executive at Independent News and Media, directly after its latest agm last Friday to get his reaction to pressing matters at the company.
Colette Sexton: Given the ODCE investigation, what impact do you think the chairmanship of Leslie Buckley had on the company?
Michael Doorly: I can’t comment on this process.
CS: Do you think journalists trust INM now, or will they leave?
MD: No comment.
CS: In terms of the €10 million restructure you talked to me about before, is that still going ahead?
MD: Our plans are going ahead as outlined today, absolutely, yes. That was an estimated figure. That wasn’t a definitive figure, but yes, there is no change to our approach to the business. We are very focused on managing the business.
CS: What about the paywall?
MD: Again we are still very focused. It is all about audience. It is all about data, making sure that we provide what people are looking for and we will be looking at how to monetise that.
CS: We previously spoke about the media merger legislation. Has INM made any headway in lobbying the government on that, or do you have any plans to?
MD: There is no doubt we need consolidation in the industry, and we are going to have to look at that again, and we are going to have to lobby if necessary. There needs to be consolidation in the industry to sustain the industry.
CS: Are you actively looking for acquisitions at the moment, or is that on hold?
MD: Yes. It is not on hold. We are actively looking. We are actively driving the business forward.
CS: Will they be media acquisitions?
MD: We have quite a wide range of interests, media and other.
CS: Will the others be related to the Newspread business?
MD: Including the Newspread business.

Cancer scandal fails to dent FG’s popularity

Highlight: Fine Gael at 35 per cent, a two point gain from last month’s poll 
Body


Fine Gael appears to have emerged unscathed from the cervical cancer scandal, with the party’s support now at its highest level for six years in the latest Sunday Business Post/Red C poll.
The party is now at 34 per cent, which is two points up on last month’s Red C poll.
The results suggest that the public has laid the blame for the failure to notify at least 162 women about false smear tests for cervical cancer at the door of the HSE, rather than Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s government.
The last time Fine Gael enjoyed this level of support was back in October 2012, when the party had been buoyed by promises of a “special deal” on Irish bank debt from the EU.
It means that Fine Gael under Varadkar is now comfortably ahead of its poor showing in the 2016 general election, when it got 25.5 per cent of the vote.
But Fine Gael has also been fortunate that Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin have focused more on the HSE’s role in the cervical check scandal rather than Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s lack of knowledge of it during his time in the Department of Health. The common belief in Leinster House is that this is due to the parties’ fears of sparking a political crisis that would derail the Eighth Amendment campaign.
But there is little cheer for Fianna Fáil, whose support remains unchanged on 25 per cent.
The party is now nine points behind Fine Gael again. Despite internal rumblings, the party is in no position to contemplate an early general election on these numbers.
There is also a major obstacle for any Fine Gael strategists thinking of pressing home their poll advantage – in the form of Brexit. As soon as the eighth amendment result is announced on Saturday, the focus will switch to the key summit of EU leaders on Brexit on June 28-29. As one European expert said recently, it would be disastrous for the country to have either an interim taoiseach or a new taoiseach walking into the room with fellow EU prime ministers at such a late stage in the negotiations.
But there is a boost in support for Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who was the most vocal and persistent in calling for the resignation of former HSE chief executive Tony O’Brien over the cervical check scandal. During the taking of the poll, she also appeared on the Claire Byrne debate on the Eighth Amendment referendum arguing for a Yes vote.
Interestingly, Sinn Féin TDs have been told to have their election poster photos ready this week, in another sign that the political system as a whole is preparing for an election in 2018 at the latest.
The rise in Sinn Féin’s support has been at the expense of Independents, who are down significantly by four points to 9 per cent. This is despite the strong performance of Independent TDs like Catherine Connolly and Claire Daly on the cervical cancer issue.
The fact that the Independent Alliance’s support level is continuing to rise by two points to 4 per cent, is another boost for government stability. The four remaining ministers have overcome the departure of Sean Canney TD and the continued protests by some rural TDs against Minister for Transport Shane Ross’s drink-driving bill.
Labour’s support level remains on 6 per cent – which is the same figure it has achieved in eleven of the last 12 Red C polls.
The Solidarity-People Before Profit Alliance party was at one with Sinn Féin last week in calling for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador to Ireland, after Israeli soldiers shot dead 60 unarmed Palestinian protestors on the Gaza border on ‘Bloody Monday’. The government dismissed this as gesture politics, but after a series of poor polls, Solidarity-People Before Profit Alliance is up by one point to 3 per cent.
The Green Party is unchanged on 2 per cent. The Social Democrats are down by one point to 1 per cent, while Renua is down by one point to zero.

Central Bank questions AIB on 700 EBS tracker mortgages

Body


The Central Bank of Ireland is in talks with AIB about almost 700 tracker mortgages given out by the EBS. The regulator and bank are focusing on whether or not these customers should have been given tracker mortgages in the first place, or whether or not their tracker mortgage rates were removed after mortgage holders asked for additional top-up loans.
About 677 mortgages are being looked at by the Central Bank and AIB.
AIB acquired the EBS for €1 in 2011 during the financial crisis, but both continue to maintain separate brands and branches. In a statement, AIB said: “AIB’s tracker mortgage examination is being fully carried out in line with the Central Bank framework.
“The bank has made significant progress in redressing and compensating impacted customers. The examination remains a key priority. To date 96 per cent of identified impacted customers have been sent payment.
“Our approach to the tracker mortgage examination has been broad in its scope. Our priority is to continue the progress. We believe we have identified and paid the vast majority of impacted customers. The tracker mortgage review is ongoing and is subject to continuous engagement with the Central Bank.”
It declined to comment on the numbers of EBS customers potentially impacted by a decision.
The tracker mortgage scandal in Ireland has seen tens of thousands of customers being overcharged by their lenders in various banks when they were either unfairly denied a tracker rate, or charged the wrong rate of interest on their mortgage.
As of the end of March, about 37,100 customers were accepted by bankers as having been affected by tracker mortgage failings.

Central Bank: Brexit could cripple the IFSC

Body


The Central Bank has warned that the state may have to step in to stop the IFSC from seizing up in the event of a hard Brexit, and that insurers could default on claims if no deal is reached between Britain and the EU before the deadline of next March.
An internal bank analysis of the factors that could cause “systemic shocks” to Ireland also lays bare major risks to key IFSC activities, including the multitrillion-euro funds industry.
The Central Bank analysis details four key risks which have “the potential to cause the most significant disruption on day one post-Brexit” to the state.
Most notably, it calls on the state to be ready to step up with an elevated response if financial sector players are overwhelmed.
It states that “while firms’ contingency planning should mitigate the risks in some instances, there are other risks that may require intervention from policymakers and/or regulators”.
The analysis of insurance operations finds that, in a hard Brexit, British insurers would lose their right to conduct business here, and Irish and other European insurers would lost their right to write business in Britain.
This, it says, could result in a “potentially significant consumer issue, eg, due to a Brexit ‘force majeure event’, firms may not pay out on claims”.
The second risk focuses on the fact that traders in derivatives, foreign exchange, securities and options may lose access to British central counterparty clearing houses.
These institutions are key parts of the financial system which take on risk in transactions and allow for the smooth running of the global financial system.
The third risk, the loss of passporting services, is “particularly problematic in a fund management context”. If British fund managers become non-EU entities with no transition deal, Irish authorised investment funds could “lose their fund manager”, the paper finds. Irish domiciled funds were worth more than €2.5 trillion at the end of February this year.
Irish fund managers, it says, could also lose their rights to delegate investment management or risk functions to British entities.
The risks on data protection are accentuated by the strictures of GDPR, the tough new EU rules which Britain may tinker with in domestic legislation after it leaves the bloc.

Closing the protection gap for women

Body


While it is increasingly acknowledged that there is a pay gap for women, or that there is a growing pension gap for working women, there is another anomaly which has flown under the radar for many. And that is the ‘protection gap’ for women.
Protection is broken down into death benefits and living benefits. Even though statistics tell us that women generally tend to live longer than men, women are more likely to suffer illness or injury during their working lives and beyond.
In general terms, men are far more insured in both forms of protection, but this can no longer be justified with the traditional stereotype of men in the workforce or the single ‘breadwinner’ of the family unit. These gaps have been passed onto the current generation of women through inertia and lack of knowledge. Failure to catch up to this will be detrimental to all stakeholders without adequate financial planning.
Research from Coyne Research on behalf of Irish Life in 2017 found less than half of women had any form of protection in comparison to 60 per cent of men.
And while death claims for women for life insurance are 64, this average age is 67 for men.
The research showed that women are dying from cancer much more than men – 54 per cent of women to 38 per cent of men.
Claims statistics for 2017 from Friends First, a provider of income protection insurance, found that women made up 59 per cent of their claims book due to inability to work due to illness or injury. These figures play out consistently across the life assurers’ claims information.
A snapshot of actuarial calculations (see table) shows the risks in protection of income to a woman versus a man at certain age intervals, noting the final column of increased risk to women.
Irish society, of course, is not as homogenous as it once was and so this raises some obvious questions such as how are we mitigating the protection risks for new types of family units?
There are multiple challenges now for the woman/mother.
Cohabiting couples with poorer tax treatment face obvious protection issues, as do single mothers who are the sole providers and who must protect their biggest asset – their incomes. Divorce and its impact are also considerations, as are inheritance tax issues. And let’s not forget that children are not leaving the homestead as early as they once would have, thus ensuring extended parental protection is now required for so many.
Women, then, must start thinking more about themselves and about their own unique situation. As we have something of a creaking health system and medical trends are changing we should be doing more to protect our families, incomes and, of course, lives. This applies to all demographics of women in society. A financial brokerage will be able to guide you through the necessary steps to provide both for yourself and your loved ones.

Coat rails and clocking in: health officials resisting move to lavish €100m HQ

Highlight: Employees raise concerns about safety of personal items at new Baggot Street base; l  Coat rails and clocking-in facilities are among chief bones of contention 
Body


A dispute over the location of coat rails and staff clocking-in facilities is holding up the Department of Health’s move to a plush new central Dublin office, in a stand-off that has highlighted the grip of mandarins over the public sector.
The Department, which is currently embattled over its handling of the cervical cancer crisis, has been attempting to move from the dilapidated Hawkins House to a completely refurbished €100 million office block owned by beef baron Larry Goodman. The state has already paid more than €8 million in rent for the building so far.
However, unions representing civil servants at the Department have raised several concerns about the safety of their personal items, including coats, when they move
According to minutes of meetings between the Department and unions to discuss the move, one trade union official “asked how the issue of the theft of coats would be dealt with if coat rails were not located near staff and how personal possessions would be secured”.
Staff also have also said they have issues with the lack of ability to clock in for work on the ground floor of the new site at Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street, which could result in those on flexi-time arrangements losing up to five minutes.
The minutes, obtained by The Sunday Business Post under the Freedom of Information Act, state that unions were told that security should not be any more of an issue than it currently is at Hawkins House.
Unions have consistently raised issues about the move to the building, which used to be the former headquarters of Bank of Ireland. The building is now owned by Goodman, and has undergone extensive refurbishment at a cost estimated to be up to €100 million.
Two smaller buildings on the site are now the global headquarters of drug company Shire. Rents at the site are said to command the highest rate per square foot in the area.
As revealed by this newspaper last year, one union claimed the relocation would see staff working in call centre-like conditions, as civil servants would have to work in clusters of six desks, and there were fewer private offices for senior officials in Miesian Plaza than in the current building.
The union also said members would incur extra travel, childcare and other costs as a result.
Several members of the various unions, according to the minutes of meetings held last year and this year, had requested swapping roles with civil servants in other government departments, to avoid going to Miesian Plaza.
In addition to the open-plan seating arrangements, they had also voiced concerns with some desks being located near to toilets and some staff being seated adjacent to lifts that have no screening from other workers or visitors accessing the lifts.
The Department of Health has reduced the number of staff sitting in large clusters, according to the documents. In a letter last July to the Civil & Public Services Union, Jim Breslin, secretary-general of the Department of Health, said he understood the apprehension about the changes.
He added that the revised plans for the building has “further reduced the number of seating arrangements for five or more people. There are now 17 such seating configurations down from the highest level of 26”.
In a separate letter last November, to the head of the Association of Higher Civil & Public Servants, Breslin wrote that Hawkins House was “rapidly approaching the end of its useful life” and that, on the advice of the Office of Public Works, it needed to “accelerate plans to provide the department with replacement accomodation”.
According to another set of minutes, a date of during the first quarter of 2018 was mooted for the move. It is understood that the move is imminent.

Consequences of lying down with vultures

The unfettered, and unparalleled, sell-off of Ireland continues. Permanent TSB, a bank saved and owned by the taxpayer, said last week that it was encouraged by the strong investor interest” in Project Glas, a controversial portfolio of debt secured against 11,200 homes.
AIB, meanwhile, confirmed last Thursday that a consortium led by US distressed-debt firm Cerberus had agreed to acquire €1.1 billion of bad loans at a huge discount as part of the bank’s effort to shore up its balance sheet.
The former Bank of Scotland (Ireland) is selling €5 billion of residential and buy-to-let mortgages, in a move estimated to affect more than 20,000 homeowners.
Vulture funds acquiring distressed Irish debt is nothing new, of course. It is effectively government policy, a key part of Ireland’s effort to restore its economic sovereignty. However, for the most part, the sales over the past five years have been relates to commercial property. Now, as the banks begin to look at their remnants of their problems loans, the attention is turning to mortgages. This is where the real problem will start.
The Central Bank has, correctly, stated that there is no evidence to date that vulture funds will repossess more houses than mainstream, regulated banks.
However, much of this is due to the fact that the funds have been busy working their way through large loans and dealing with big ticket deals and highly leveraged developers.
Put bluntly, they have not got around to dealing with distressed mortgages yet.
Those at the coalface of the looming crisis are worried. David Hall, a longtime campaigner for mortgage holders, told the Oireachtas Finance Committee last week that that he believes 17,000 families will end up losing their homes if radical action is not taken.
“One of the greatest affronts to those citizens crucified by the recession was the government’s willingness to sell them out to vultures. Not only those in arrears, but also those that had performing loans,” he said.
The decision by the banks to sell to vulture funds has presented as something of a fait accompli, as the only option available. This is something that the Central Bank has openly disagreed with, while a number of influential voices have long been stating that there are other options.
In a letter to the late Brian Lenihan jr in 2010, the master of the High Court, Edmund Honohan, proposed that the regulated banks should club together, like the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland which deals with claims from uninsured drivers, to buy out sub-prime mortgages and allow distressed mortgage holders to stay on in their homes as caretakers.
He has also previously urged the state to nationalise repossessed homes. Working at the coalface of the problem, he has even written a new bill which would give greater powers to the state’s financial and legal support services and stronger protections to people who are in mortgage arrears.
Selling to vulture funds is not the only option. But it is the option that the banks have chosen to pursue because it is, quite simply, the easiest and most cost-efficient. However, it may have devasting consequences in the long term. And no one can say they were not warned.

Former taoiseach Liam Cosgrave has left €33.7 million in his will, due to his ownership of a prime development site around his home.
The bungalow where he lived is located on a 13-acre site on Scholarstown Road in Templeogue, south Dublin, which is one of the last undeveloped areas in the vicinity.
Due to the demand for housing, development land in the capital commands prices of up to €5 million per acre.
The land has been zoned ‘residential’ for housing for decades, but Cosgrave made no move to sell it off at any stage. When he was asked about it during his retirement, his response was that he had no interest in doing that.
Cosgrave died last October at the age of 97.
The former Fine Gael leader served as taoiseach of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition government that was in office for four years in the mid-1970s. The son of WT Cosgrave, he was a TD for the old Dublin county constituency between 1943 and 1948 before he held a seat in Dún Laoghaire until his retirement from politics in 1981.
The site was put on the market earlier this year. His wife Vera had died in 2016. During the recent economic recession, Cosgrave gifted back €5,000 per year to the state from his ministerial pension of €19,816. He was given a limited state funeral in accordance with his family’s wishes.
He is survived by his daughter Mary and his sons Liam junior and Ciarán.

Coveney insists Brexit guarantee of no hard border won’t be dropped

Tánaiste Simon Coveney has insisted that the government will not drop its demand for a legally binding guarantee of no hard border at the forthcoming EU summit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has floated the idea of Britain remaining tied to a customs union with the EU after the two-year Brexit transition period ends in 2021.
That could temporarily avoid the requirement to have customs checks on goods at the border, but no detail has been provided as to how long this arrangement would last and what would replace it.
Coveney told The Sunday Business Post that he wanted to see the British government make “substantial progress” towards a legally sound guarantee of no hard border in the EU withdrawal treaty by next month’s summit.
“Ireland’s position hasn’t changed once. We regret but respect the UK decision to leave the EU. However, we also want the agreements and guarantees around Brexit respected,” he said.
There is no willingness in government to accept a temporary solution instead of the so-called backstop - the British government guarantee that it will maintain full alignment with the rules of the internal market and the customs union in the North unless there is a better option.
And it is adamant that it will force a confrontation at the EU summit at the end of June if there is no progress, rather than leaving everything to the final summit in October.
Coveney made it clear he was reserving judgement on May’s proposal until it was submitted to chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
“When it comes to the future, we want the closest possible relationship with the UK but the place to bring proposals is to the negotiating table in Brussels,” he said.
Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said it was welcome that the British government was talking about staying in the customs union for longer.
“It would be brilliant if it was a long-term plan. But I would be concerned that it is a temporary solution. The backstop absolutely must remain part of the withdrawal treaty,” she said.
Sinn Féin Brexit spokesman David Cullinane also said the British government needed to come up with a practical solution to avoid a hard border.
“We are being asked to comment on a vague proposal which we haven’t seen the substance or the detail of. There should be no prospect of us surrendering what was billed as a cast-iron solution from some sort of temporary new idea,” he said.

Fashion designer Susannagh Grogan has seen her online sales double as a result of her participation in a scheme aimed at getting more Irish craft and design firms online.
Grogan described the Optimise programme, which is funded by the IE Domain Registry, the Design & Crafts Council of Ireland and the country’s local enterprise offices, as “practical and helpful”.
“It included a really detailed audit of my website with a view to increasing sales to a global online audience,” Grogan told The Sunday Business Post. “They gave me an incredibly detailed to-do list, most of which I’ve now implemented. I could never have done such an extensive audit on my own.”
Grogan, who specialises in silk scarves and tunics, said online sales for January to April of this year were double what they were in 2017. She has extended her product range this season with her tunics, which are on sale on her website as well as in Brown Thomas, priced at €295 each.
“I’ve designed them to get plenty of wear – they can be worn over swimwear on the beach during the day, with bare legs and sandals in the evening, or over palazzo pants if the weather is a little cooler,” she said. Product development and researching new suppliers will be a key focus for Grogan for the rest of this year. “I’ve a lot of ideas in the pipeline,” she said.
“I’ve been concentrating on researching and gaining new suppliers so I can continue to deliver large-quantity orders when we get commissions. “As well as Ireland and Italy, we have a new partner in India who also works with Dries Van Noten and Peter Pilotto.”
Grogan, who is based in Dún Laoghaire in south Dublin, studied printed textile design at the Chelsea College of Art & Design in London. Her design clients have included Victoria’s Secret, Macy’s, Tommy Hilfiger and Anthropologie.

Expert on Savita case says he will back a vote for Yes

The author of the report into the death of Savita Halappanavar will arrive in Ireland tomorrow to join the Yes campaign’s final push for a repeal of the Eighth Amendment.
Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran will argue that the 31-year-old died as a result of the constitutional ban on abortion and that it should not have taken Ireland five years after her death to remove it.
The physician, who recommended in his 2013 report on Halappanavar’s death that the provision be removed from the Constitution, will take part in a press conference with the Irish Family Planning Association on Tuesday morning.
Savita Halappanavar died in University Hospital Galway in October 2012. She had asked for a termination after being told she was having a miscarriage but was refused. Days later she died from a sepsis infection.
Prof Arulkumaran said that had she had the termination when requested, she would not have developed the infection and would not have died. He believes the doctors made their decision based on the constitutional ban on abortion.
As the campaign enters its final days, the Tánaiste, Simon Coveney, has said that in the event of a Yes vote legislation regulating abortions would ensure that Down Syndrome was not allowed as grounds for terminating a pregnancy under any circumstances.
He said the law should specify a period of ten weeks pregnant, rather than the current proposal of 12 weeks’ gestation, for terminations to be allowed to avoid a situation whereby “people are looking for tests in advance of making a decision to terminate a pregnancy because of a diagnosis or a probability that a child may have Down Syndrome”.
In an interview with The Sunday Business Post, Coveney said that abortions would not be unrestricted during this period, as claimed by the No side.
“There will be a requirement for both a woman and a doctor to sign a fully informed consent form or document, which would ensure that all the options have been outlined, all of the consequences of a termination have been talked through,” Coveney said.
“If necessary, counselling and support would be provided. If necessary, too, a scan would be provided in terms of establishing the exact timelines of a pregnancy.
“Even after that period if a woman wants to proceed with a termination there would be a 72-hour delay period to ensure that it has had full time consideration and that nothing is rushed.”

Fine Gael TD slams Revenue for ‘red tape gone mad’

Lawyers, accountants and estate agents are being forced to post almost 10,000 suspicious transaction reports to the Revenue Commissioners in an example of “red tape gone mad”.
Since last year, the Gardaí have had a new online system for reporting all transactions which may involve money laundering, tax evasion, social welfare fraud or terrorist financing.
But the Revenue does not have a similar online system for professionals such as lawyers, accountants and estate agents who are required by law to file suspicious transaction reports (STRs).
This means that they had to submit around 10,000 STRs through the Garda online system, and then print off the same reports and post them to the Revenue.
The reports were then scanned in by the seven staff working in the Revenue’s suspicious transactions unit for processing.
The Fine Gael Longford- Westmeath TD Peter Burke, who is a chartered accountant, said it was a case of “red tape gone mad”.
“When you look at all the income tax returns being filed online, the Revenue is going completely paperless. It’s surprising to see them lagging behind in this critical area,” he said.
The Revenue does have an electronic submission system for banks who made around 14,000 of the 24,000 STRs last year. But they also have to make separate online submissions to gardaí because the Revenue and Garda systems are not linked up.
The Gardai’s financial intelligence unit provided a rare insight into how STRs work at a recent briefing to the Association of Compliance Officers in Ireland.
Officers gave the fictional example of an unemployed man who lodged €700 in his local credit union, saying that it was a bonus from work. But it was “known in the credit union that he was unemployed”, and an internet search found that he had been before the courts on drugs charges. All this information has to be filed in the ‘reason for suspicion’ category on the STR form.
The ‘description’ included the fact that the money “was damp and in poor condition” and “appeared to have been stored outside”. The STR also contains the name and address of the person making the transaction, their PPS number, their occupation, their source of wealth (usually ‘unknown’), their nationality, their bank account number and the cash balance in it.
It comes at a time when the government is imposing further requirements on ‘high value goods dealers’ to make more STRs. Antique dealers, garage owners, boat retailers and jewellers will have to report on any suspicious transactions worth over €10,000, as opposed to the current €15,000 limit, under a bill brought to the Dáil last week by Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan.
A Revenue spokeswoman said it was developing an electronic solution to deal with the 40 per cent of STRs which have to be submitted in printed form. She said it was also working with the major financial institutions to develop an electronic solution that will allow the remaining 60 per cent of STRs to be submitted simultaneously to the Revenue and the gardaí.
“It is expected that this solution will be implemented in quarter three of 2018,” she said.

Highlight: Ireland has always sought monarchs; royalty is in our DNA. So don’t be surprised at the interest in the royal wedding 
Body


All British royal weddings resemble one another. But each happy royal wedding is happy in its own way – to torture Tolstoy’s great phrase about families.
And this one was very different. Not just because the ghost of the groom’s mother, the still-lamented Princess Diana, still lingered. Nor that the antics of the bride’s father made headline news on BBC, ahead even of tragedy in the Middle East. Nor that Shakespeare’s clarion call, “Cry God for England, Harry and St George,” echoed eternally. Once more unto the breach a royal bride indeed.
It was different, not just because record numbers watched it and the frame of popular cultural references left no taste uncatered for: the intelligence of The Crown met the conspicuous consumption of the Kardashians; the tradition of Brideshead blended with the spontaneity of bling; the British stiff upper lip softened to Suits – the Hollywood version.
No, this one was different because the couple exuded happiness. And the fact that Meghan Markle comes from the real world, a feminist, bi-racial woman, who has worked for her living, all adds to the chances of honesty and therefore happiness.
More to the point, it gives some meaning to the Irish obsession with all things royal.
Not everything about this unusual match was a first, but for me the real first was that the glass carriage carrying the American bride of sixth-in-line-to-the-throne Prince Harry, managed the well travelled road between St George’s Chapel and Windsor without commentators wearing out the phrase “fairy tale”. Because if English monarchical history – recent and ancient – has taught us anything, it is that fairy tales have a dark side.
The world watched the long deconstruction of the Princess Diana romantic narrative, aghast at the way that fairy tale turned sordid. I was features editor of the Sunday Independent at that time and I watched it more closely than most.
On a grey November day in 1992, I found myself on a grey London street looking for the office of Michael O’Mara, the publisher who was about to land a bombshell book on the world. It wasn’t an office, it was a house on a street on the cusp of gentrification. The bins outside revealed that it hadn’t got there yet. The living room was small and full of books. I was given a taste of, and a contract for, the second serial rights of Diana, Her True Story by Andrew Morton, the book that would change the course of modern royal history.
Andrew Neil, editor of the Sunday Times, with all the wealth of that juggernaut newspaper group, had secured the first rights: to get second serial rights for less than 10 per cent of what the Sunday Times paid was a publishing coup in itself.
It paid dividends in circulation figures, but it didn’t all happen by chance. I had been aware of the troubled state of Diana’s marriage for some time before that.
In 1989, a much valued young colleague departed for New York. In order not to lose her talent entirely, I commissioned an American Diary from her. As part of her brief and in order to verify the authenticity of what she covered, she sent a package of American journals and magazines every week. Primitive, yes. But this was pre-Google, pre-Lexus Nexus, pre-social media: the fax was the revolutionary medium at the time.
It wasn’t long before I spotted something striking in the publications – a regular stream of stories from “friends” of Princess Diana, detailing her unhappiness with her marriage, her suicide attempts, her bulimia, her therapists, rows with Charles over his continuing love affair with Camilla, her detestation of the royal family, their disapproval of her. On and on it went. All this at a time the royal correspondents in England covered royal stories in a positive, rosy glow.
The detail was too compelling. What possible reason could there be for American editors to make it up? Queries to a few well-placed sources in England verified the fact: Diana was deeply unhappy. We had unwittingly, in a highly unorthodox way, stumbled on to the same territory as Andrew Morton.
[caption id="attachment_417063" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Diana and Charles share a tender moment during their marriage[/caption]
People wanted to talk, the sine qua non of journalism. And the Irish public wanted to read. About the royal family.
The Irish public has always wanted to devour stuff about the royals. Only Sinn Féin, yet again showing its disconnect from the Republic, thinks otherwise. Happily, RTÉ had no truck with Belfast councillor Niall Ó Donnghaile’s criticisms last week of its broadcasting of the wedding.
Sinn Féin may huff and puff, but ironically it has been my experience that the more nationalist the belief system, the greater the interest in the British royals. My mother was a staunch nationalist from a border county. I grew up in Cork with a knowledge of the royal family tree from Queen Victoria down that astounded my friends.
How did I know so much about Princess Alice, Princess Marina –“the most beautiful of them all” according to my mother – Princess Alexandra and so on. The German side, the Greek side – “Prince Philip is more royal than any of them” – her interest knew no bounds. My friends soon shared the fascination. Thus at an early age I realised the Irish have an interest in the British royal family that borders on a fetish.
Nationalists and royals? The question is not “why?” but “why not?”. How could it be otherwise? Royalty is in our DNA.
We had a system of kings and kingship until Elizabeth I dismantled it in the early 17th century. We didn’t succumb to the philosophy of the French Revolution. Indeed at that time we longed for a return to monarchy, calling the great Liberator Daniel O’Connell, the uncrowned king of Ireland. We have always sought monarchs.
It was hardly surprising, then, that Princess Diana joined the cast of characters of the Keane Edge, the Sunday Independent’s social diary. The Keane Edge was a column people loved to hate: Fintan O’Toole captured its purpose in his phrase “delightful satire of Irish social life”. It spanned a decade neatly, chronicling the excesses of the 1990s, peopled with public faces who, a decade later, began to turn up in Nama or before Oireactas committees.
Diana was a natural fit with the developers and divas and, contrary to conventional wisdom and as with most Keane Edge stories, there were few legal difficulties.
One highly-placed libel lawyer to Queen Elizabeth II, Peter Carter-Ruck, who represented Prince Charles’s friend Tiggy Legge-Bourke, did complain once, not of an inaccuracy, but of a phrase. Unlike many of the highly sensitive silks in Ireland, he was happy with a story rectifying the issue.
[caption id="attachment_417064" align="alignright" width="264"] Wallis Simpson and Prince Edward at their 1937 wedding after his abdication[/caption]
The gist of the Diana saga was that she wanted out of her marriage, something the British press dared not mention. So accurate was our coverage that on the day the royal separation was announced, the BBC rang to interview Terry Keane as a journalist who had predicted it.
After that, between the announcement of the royal separation in December 1992 and her death in August 1997, all magazine editors were wise to the fact that a Diana cover story doubled the circulation, not merely because of her beauty but because she was one of “Us” not “Them”. As she took ownership of her own private soap opera, and held up for the British public a mirror of their own lives, the royal family were momentarily imperilled.
The most talkative celebrity in a confessional age, she was a victim of psychological abuse and her abusers were the royal family. In classic trajectory she turned it first inwards through bulimia and suicide attempts and then, on coming to terms with it, turned it outward to try to help others. She had a great five years, while the royal family looked on stunned.
Her death threatened the whole edifice. The royals showed no understanding of the nation’s grief. Tony Blair did, capturing the grief in the phrase “the people’s princess”. At her funeral in St Paul’s cathedral, Diana’s brother Charles Spencer’s term “the blood family,” seemed downright threatening.
It wasn’t the first time the royal family had fought back from the brink as afficionadoes of The Crown know. There was the time Princess Margaret was prevented from marrying the love of her life, Captain Peter Townsend. Her subsequent unsatisfactory life was a permanent rebuke to her family.
And of course there was the abdication scandal. Edward and Mrs Simpson may invite a superficial comparison with Harry and Meghan – she is after all American and divorced and he did once in a drunken escapade put on Nazi paraphernalia, but there the similarity ends.
Never was the chasm between myth and reality greater than the epic qualities projected onto Edward’s announcement that he could not “continue without the support of the woman I love”. Wallis Simpson absolutely did not want to marry Edward. She cried bitter tears on hearing the speech, but her fate was sealed. They went on to live extravagant lives of total misery. The only good thing to be said about it is that by being the catalyst for the abdication she saved Britain from having a Nazi appeaser as head of state.
Yesterday’s joyous nuptials show just how the royals have turned it all around in the two decades since Diana’s death. And much of the credit for that must surely go to the queen. Her decision to visit Grenfell Towers in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, while prime minister Theresa May seemed paralysed, shows empathy, not to mention savvy, of a high order: a 90-year-old woman still learning from the mistakes of the past.
The royal family misread the public mood once. Never again. This is why Meghan Markle is not merely accepted, she is clasped to the royal bosom with hoops of steel. She, an American, is a one-woman symbol of the contradictions of modern Britain.
She’s bi-racial (the great-great-great-granddaughter of a slave), in a country that has more mixed race relationships than any other country in Europe, yet treated its Windrush generation disgracefully. She comes from a broken home – has a deeply embarrassing father, a troubled extended family – but believes in the dream of family, the Royal family. And she brings popular culture in her slipstream like the wedding dress – although last week’s Coronation Street-style saga was definitely an unintended consequence. In short, by her very existence she shows how in touch with reality the royal family are.
She has her own contradictions too of course. She’s a feminist and an activist, but has got out of showbiz at the #MeToo moment – arguably activist feminists’ greatest challenge. In truth, perhaps all relationships have an element of escape for one protagonist and rescue fantasy for the other.
Why should we demand that they be superhuman? Is it not enough that they give us our escapist moment? For several shining hours yesterday, we could escape, even momentarily forget, cervical screening scandals, homelessness, the attritions of Repeal the Eighth.
Some turned on yesterday out of devotion to Diana and others for the sheer suspense of Megan Markle’s family drama. Voyeurism and escapism – the twin pathologies of our passion for all things royal – are the reason we crowded around television screens in our millions in homes and hubs, lunch parties and pubs.
Who doesn’t want to wallow in the pomp and circumstance, the fashion and the formality, the crowned heads and the celebrities? Besides, let’s face it, the sheer brilliance and relevance of Netflix’s The Crown has given even the intellectuals a cover for watching.
The reasons may be myriad, but personally I believe there’s one which underwrites it all. We want to believe in love and happiness.

Former Garda press officer loses his tongue during four-day grilling

Highlight: Extracting testimony from the Disclosures Tribunal’s most important witness, Superintendent Dave Taylor, proved a painful process 
Body


On several occasions, Superintendent Dave Taylor had to be asked to speak up. “I appreciate it’s not easy giving evidence and all the rest of it, but the microphone is now on full blast,” Justice Peter Charleton told the witness last Tuesday.
The chairman of the Disclosures Tribunal helpfully suggested that the former Garda press officer could maybe point the microphone up a bit or something. “But I mean, you have experience in these matters,” Charleton said.
“Yeah,” Taylor replied softly, on day two of an uncomfortable four-day stint testifying at Dublin Castle. While his answers tended towards brevity, it was still proving difficult to catch the evidence of arguably the Disclosures Tribunal’s most important witness.
After all, the inquiry was set up on the back of claims made by Taylor, in a protected disclosure in September 2016, that he had been instructed by former Garda commissioner Martin Callinan to conduct a smear campaign against whistleblower Maurice McCabe.
He alleges he was ordered to brief journalists that McCabe was driven by malice and revenge, and to link his motivation in highlighting penalty points irregularities to a previous child sex abuse allegation made by Ms D, the child of a Garda colleague, in Cavan in 2006.
The complaint was investigated and McCabe was exonerated. The Director of Public Prosecutions found the sergeant had no case to answer.
According to Taylor, the smear campaign started in mid-2013 and ended with Callinan’s shock resignation in March the following year. The tribunal heard that, while the negative briefings faded away under Callinan’s successor Nóirín O’Sullivan, she was fully aware of the moves to discredit the whistleblower, made prior to her promotion, while she was deputy commissioner.
On becoming commissioner, O’Sullivan, who Taylor said would not have been his first choice for the top job, transferred him from the press office to the traffic corps where he remains today.
The superintendent also claims he discussed Callinan’s instructions with the Garda’s civilian director of communications, Andrew McLindon. His allegations have been met with outright denials from Callinan, O’Sullivan and McLindon respectively.
Dave Taylor was promoted to the role of Garda press officer in 2012, having received about 50 minutes training from Carr Communications, the tribunal heard last Monday.
It was day one of his testimony. Despite his being a key protagonist in the tribunal, there were as few as 20 people in the public gallery.
Taylor explained that at the outset of his new job, he was instructed by Callinan to develop good relationships with the media and make sure to project the Garda Síochána in the best light. He engaged with his boss on a daily basis.
He told Diarmuid McGuinness, senior counsel for the tribunal, that by mid-2013 the then commissioner was becoming “deeply frustrated” that the penalty points issue raised by McCabe was reflecting badly on the force and showing no signs of abating.
“You have to understand, Mr McGuinness, that anything that reflects badly on senior Garda management is something that cannot, in their mind, be tolerated,” Taylor said.
[caption id="attachment_416909" align="alignleft" width="698"] Former Garda press officer Superintendent Dave Taylor Pic: Rollingnews[/caption]
He claimed that at this time he was given specific instructions by Callinan, in his office at Garda headquarters, to take every opportunity with the media to drop in the historic sexual allegation against McCabe in order to discredit him and suggest “there’s a backstory there”. He said Callinan’s instructions were always verbal.
Asked by counsel if he believed his instructions were improper, he replied that he took what Callinan said about McCabe as fact. He added that as the Garda is a “disciplined force” he was obliged to act on an order.
What allegedly followed were numerous opportunistic briefings with 11 reporters, either over the phone or at crime scenes. While Taylor nominated some of the best known crime journalists in the country – Mick O’Toole, Paul Williams, Paul Reynolds and Conor Lally among others – he struggled to recollect the specifics of any conversation or to pinpoint exact dates when they took place.
This “peculiar” inability to recall detail resulted in a lengthy grilling from the various legal teams.
According to Taylor, these journalists, deemed to be “sympathetic” to the view of Garda management, didn’t react. They simply took the information he supplied on board. He said Lally, of the Irish Times, was the only one to challenge his claims about McCabe.
Political journalists were in the frame too, including Juno McEnroe and Danny McConnell from the Examiner. Not one of them came forward to corroborate Taylor’s claims. Several reporters invoked journalistic privilege.
Others like Reynolds and fellow RTÉ journalist John Burke denied outright being on the receiving end of the smears. O’Toole from the Irish Daily Star did both.
Rossa Fanning SC, representing Paul Williams who interviewed Ms D in early 2014, put it to Taylor that his allegations were “inherently implausible and demonstrably false”.
Charleton, seemingly growing more incredulous, noted that it was very hard to find anything negative about McCabe in the media. He asked Taylor if his smear campaign had been something of a flop. The superintendent said he accepted that.
Taylor’s evidence raised other conflicts. Sergeant McCabe, Mick Clifford of the Irish Examiner and Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness all claim Taylor told them he had sent hundreds of text messages as part of the smear campaign. This was denied by Taylor, who later had a phone seized while under arrest.
The tribunal heard Taylor maintained good relations with Callinan right up to the commissioner’s premature departure in a haze of controversy. Taylor sent him the following message: “Commissioner, I feel so sorry for the way you have been treated. It’s despicable. You will always be the boss to me and I’m proud to have served under you and worked with you. You were inspirational to me.”
However, Taylor was later to have what was described by a lawyer for Garda management as an “epiphany” about his role in the alleged smear campaign.
On September 30, 2016, he made a protected disclosure while suspended from the force.
His suspension was due to a criminal investigation into media leaks regarding the taking into care of Roma children three years earlier. At the time of the disclosure, the probe had narrowed in on Taylor, who faced the very real prospect of being prosecuted.
Chief Supt Frank Clerkin had led the investigation into the disclosure of sensitive information, and had recommended to the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2015 that Taylor be prosecuted.
It had emerged in the course of the probe that in the four months after leaving the job of press officer, Taylor had 11,000 contacts with journalists, nearly a quarter of which were with Eavan Murray from the Irish Sun newspaper. There were accusations he had liked his old job so much he ran his own “private press office” from the traffic corps at Dublin Castle.
Last year, the DPP decided not to press charges and the superintendent returned to work in the traffic corps. He described his change of heart as an “evolution” that took place away from the “hothouse” atmosphere of the force, a realisation that what he was part of was wrong.
Ten days earlier he said he had met McCabe, essentially to confess what he had done. While he later met TD Clare Daly and journalist Mick Clifford, the tribunal heard he had not spoken to anybody prior to his disclosure, apart from his wife Michelle and a priest.
It was put to Taylor that he was fixated on O’Sullivan and her husband Chief Supt Jim McGowan, who was involved in the investigation against him. He denied “lashing out” with his protected disclosure.
“Gerald Kean, as we all know, is a very gregarious character,” the former Garda commissioner Martin Callinan told the inquiry last Friday.
He was explaining to tribunal barrister Patrick Marrinan why he had spent about an hour, over the course of several phone conversations, speaking to the well-known solicitor before and after Kean’s panel appearance on the Marian Finucane show in January 2014.
Allegedly based on his briefing with Callinan, Kean made controversial and incorrect on-air comments about the penalty points scandal to the effect that McCabe had breached the Data Protection Act and had not cooperated with an internal inquiry.
He “panicked” when McCabe contacted the show and then wrote to him threatening to sue him for defamation. He told the tribunal he felt he had been “used” by Callinan.
[caption id="attachment_416908" align="alignright" width="734"] Garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe[/caption]
Kean then privately sent Callinan a draft response to McCabe’s letter. The commissioner wrote up some notes to add to Kean’s letter which were conveyed in a meeting between Kean and Callinan’s private secretary Frank Walsh.
On the stand, the former commissioner, dressed in a sober navy suit, straightened his tie while he considered his answers about Kean. He had not made mention of this episode in his first statement to the tribunal because he said he had forgotten it had taken place.
But buried in the tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of disclosed documents, the tribunal team found the note in Callinan’s handwriting. Atypically, it had not been placed on the Garda’s correspondence register.
Callinan denied that he had asked Kean to keep their conversations about McCabe secret and insisted he had only passed on information that was already in the public domain.
He said Kean would not have got himself into difficulty on Marian Finucane if he had stuck to what he had told him in advance on the phone. “He certainly wasn’t a spokesman for An Garda Síochána,” he said.
While they had spoken in total for around an hour on the phone, much of it was social chat, Callinan maintained. Kean, who he had met once before, was telling him about VIPs he had met over the years.
“This man is an extensive talker. We were talking at great length about parties, guards in Cork. He was all over the place. I don’t mean disrespect. I have great time for the man.”
He agreed that moves to draft a response to McCabe’s threat of defamation for Kean were “wholly inappropriate”. McCabe was a serving Garda member, one of his own employees. It was not, he said, one of his best days. “Hindsight is wonderful,” he added.
Later in his evidence he denied claims by RTÉ journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes that he had described McCabe as a “troubled individual” with psychological issues who was motivated by a set of grievances. The conversation is alleged to have taken place in the RTÉ studios ahead of his appearance on the Crimecall programme in December 2013.
Callinan said he was a great admirer of Boucher-Hayes but he “absolutely” did not have that conversation.
Callinan told the tribunal he had felt he had a statutory obligation to inform the then justice minister Alan Shatter about McCabe’s historical allegation of inappropriate contact with a child.
He said Shatter specifically asked him if there was anything in McCabe’s background he should be aware of. He said they did not dwell on it.
Callinan told tribunal lawyers he could not say if the allegation might have been a motivating factor for McCabe’s subsequently blowing the whistle on the quashing of penalty points. “I wasn’t making the link, Chairman,” he said.
Nor was there a question of him trying to discredit McCabe, the tribunal heard. “Far from it,” the former commissioner said.
“I had no intention of bringing down Sergeant McCabe, nor would I have had the time to do so.” Callinan’s evidence continues this week.

Fruit business Keelings lobbied minister over migrant workers

David Keeling of Dublin fruit farm company Keelings lobbied the enterprise minister Heather Humphreys to loosen the restrictions on work permits for farm workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
The meeting between Keeling and Humphreys took place earlier this year at an event hosted by food producer Monaghan Mushrooms, according to a filing to the lobbying register.
A spokesperson for Keelings said the lobbying related to a proposed pilot scheme – announced last week by the minister – which would allow for work permits to be issued to farm workers from outside the EEA.
The spokesperson said that “Keelings, along with a number of other Irish agri-food companies, were involved in this process and welcome the announcement of a pilot scheme which will help such businesses”.
The changes, which will operate on a pilot basis initially, include an allowance for 500 permits for the horticulture sector, 250 for the meat industry and 50 for the dairy sector.
Humphreys said in a statement that, “As we approach full employment, labour shortages at the lower-skilled end of the jobs market are becoming apparent in some sectors.
This has the potential to constrict growth if these needs are not met. Parts of the agri-food sector are particularly affected in the immediate term.”
The rules will require a “minimum remuneration threshold of €22,000 . . . for these occupations” and will place “specific obligations on the employers around the welfare and prospects of the foreign nationals employed. This includes ensuring they have access to suitable accommodation and to training in areas such as language skills.”
Keelings relies heavily on seasonal workers. In 2016, as part of submissions to the Fingal County Council development plan, it asked the council to change the plan to increase the maximum number of seasonal workers a land holding could facilitate from 100 to 200.
This led to criticism from councillors, with Social Democrat councillor Cian O’Callaghan saying he was “flabbergasted” that a motion had come before the council to lower the standard of accommodation for seasonal workers.
Keelings has an annual turnover of around €330 million and employs 2,000 people at the peak of the season.

Gallagher outlines new €100m plan to develop sites around country

Clyde Real Estate, the property investment company backed by entrepreneurs Sean Gallagher and Colm Piercy, is working on a €100 million development plan for sites they own in Dublin, Cork, Dundalk and Carlow.
Gallagher, the chief executive of Clyde, told The Sunday Business Post that two of the biggest projects they were working on was advancing a masterplan for the well-known former Braun site in Carlow, as well as working on designs for 120,000 square feet of new offices in Mahon, Co Cork. “We are progressing well in terms of new developments,” he said.
Clyde has held pre-planning meetings to develop its 30-acre site in Carlow. “It is an iconic site in a great location,” Gallagher said. “We see that as a mixture of office and industrial.”
He said Clyde was also exploring building an executive-type hotel and convention centre space on the site. “We may look for some residential units too to create a blended work and live environment,” he added.
Gallagher said he believed companies looking to hire between 200 and 300 people wanted to be sure that their employees also had affordable housing nearby.
In Cork, he said, his firm had sold a building let by Voxpro in Loughmahon Technology Park to French investment firm Corum AM but retained an adjoining site. “We are looking at building a new 120,000 square foot building there or two buildings of 60,000 square foot each,” he said.
In Dublin, he said, Clyde was advancing plans to split the massive Clyde House building in Blanchardstown Business and Technology Park which sits on a 16-acre site into two. He said one of these buildings would be occupied by existing tenants while the other would be occupied by a new company.
Gallagher said Clyde’s decision to focus on investing in the regions and outside prime city centre locations was paying off. He warned, however, that Ireland needs to support its SMEs as well as international investors if it wants to grow sustainably.
“While I am a great supporter of multinationals, and we need more of them, the truth is that it is the SME community that will create jobs in areas and regions that multinationals never can,” Gallagher said.
“If we have learned anything from the downturn, it is an over-reliance on one sector or one group leaves you exposed. Before, it was the construction sector; now the danger is we could become over reliant on multinationals who can be hit by things outside our control, whether it is Brexit or US policy. We need to have a robust and expanding SME sector that is nurtured.”
Gallagher said Clyde was continuing to bid for new commercial buildings outside city centres and was also looking at sale-and-leaseback deals. He admitted Clyde had been an underbidder for the 195-acre Liffey Park Technology Campus in Co Kildare from US computer giant HP.
“That is the level we want to go to,” he said. “We want to build out greenfield sites as well as refurbish existing buildings. We will look at anything that is under-optimised.”
Gallagher said Clyde had funds of €200 million from Irish and international backers to support future deals. A former presidential candidate and Dragon on RTÉ’s Dragons’ Den, he recently published a new book called Secrets To Success (see panel), which tells Irish business success stories and the lessons they learned building their enterprises.
•	Nobody ever starts a big business. Martin Naughton the co-founder of Glen Dimplex said this. He told me nobody ever started a big business. Everyone starts small.
•	Nobody ever scales a business on their own. You need to build the right team and skill set. Scaling is about team and culture. Look at Voxpro, their culture was always think big.
•	Take a risk. We need to change our attitude to risk and failure. We teach our kids not to make mistakes. We brand people as failures. Failure is a part of the entrepreneur journey.

In late 2011, Sean Gallagher almost became president of Ireland, when his energetic and pro-entrepreneurial campaign appealed to large swathes of the country. Since his election loss, Gallagher has returned to his previous life as a businessman, building up a portfolio of industrial properties, and along with the telecoms tycoon Colm Piercy, is currently working on a €100 million development plan for sites they own in Dublin, Cork, Dundalk and Carlow.
However, Gallagher’s public profile has brought him into contact with a large number of indigenous Irish businesses across all sectors, and across all parts of the country. That is why his warning in today’s Sunday Business Post is so important.
In an interview, he argues that Ireland must give increased supports to SME as they will be the driver of job creation and industry in regional Ireland. Furthermore, he warns that Ireland is now running the risk of becoming overly exposed to multinationals.
“If we have learned anything from the downturn it is an over-reliance on one sector or one group leaves you exposed. Before it was the construction sector, now the danger is we could become over reliant on multinationals who can be hit be things outside our control whether it be Brexit or US policy,” he said.
Gallagher is not alone in his concerns. Speaking to the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight last week, the economist Seamus Coffey, the chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, said that a shock to the state’s corporation tax base is more or less inevitable. He said this would happen because corporation tax receipts were “inherently” volatile and highly concentrated around a small number of companies. “We should not be surprised, or taken by surprise, when this happens,” said Coffey.
While speaking from different perspectives, Gallagher and Coffey are essentially arguing two sides of the same coin. Gallagher believes Ireland must show more love to indigenous Irish business, while Coffey is warning of an over-reliance on multinationals.
Both are right. The industrial policy of assiduously courting multinationals has been highly successful since the days of Sean Lemass and TK Whitaker, but it needs to be recalibrated in a world of trade wars, tariffs, automation, artificial intelligence and, of course, Donald Trump and Brexit. That recalibration needs to focus more on developing the indigenous economy through a combination of enhanced supports, policy initiatives and political will.
Irish business has long lived in the shadow of multinationals when it comes to state backing – both in terms of financial backing and policy prescriptions.
Multinationals get the sort of access and tax incentives that Irish businesses can only dream of. Enterprise Ireland, meanwhile, has long been the poor relation of IDA Ireland.
This neds to change. Ireland has become too reliant on a small number of businesses, many of whom, in the case of Google and Facebook, have the capacity to drive rents and property prices in pockets of the Dublin real estate market.
To bring the economy to the next phase of its development, we need to develop a better mix of indigenous and multinational businesses. We need to heed the advice of Sean Gallagher.

Glass ceilings cracked, but changes not so crystal clear

Highlight: A pair of women were appointed to lead the CIA and Fox News last week, but gender doesn’t compensate for fundamental character flaws 
Body


Last week, history was made in the US. Twice. To paraphrase Hillary Clinton, two cracks appeared in two of the most resistant of glass ceilings. Women were appointed to lead both the CIA and Fox News, two US institutions that have proven uniquely resistant to providing level playing fields for women.
But are they cracks or cunning refractions of light?
Despite the predictable chorus of self-congratulation from both institutions – and the Trump administration that they serve - for their ‘forward-thinking approaches’ in appointing women bosses, close inspection shows little more than mirages in twin deserts of male dominance.
On Thursday, Fox News announced that Suzanne Scott, formerly its president of programming, would become its new chief executive, replacing Roger Ailes, the disgraced (and deceased) political powerbroker of the far right.
And on Friday, Gina Haspel became the first female director of the CIA after six Democrats joined 48 Republicans in a Senate confirmation vote which proved – lest any further evidence was necessary – that the Senate has lost its moral compass.
Fifty-four senators to 45 inexcusably – unless you count political expediency and moral cowardice as justification - ignored the fact that Gina Haspel oversaw a torture programme in a notorious CIA rendition site and destroyed evidence in defiance of a Congressional order.
That was then, her supporters say. Back when the white heat of fury after the 9/11 attacks exposed the fragility of democracy and the institutions that protect civil and human rights nationally and internationally. This is now – in other words another era where there is scant regard for truth, the integrity of institutions and individual morality is regarded more of a hindrance than an asset to anyone seeking employment in the Trump administration.
That Washington is fast reversing back to a circa-2003 neoconservative mindset of mendacity and belligerent paranoia is evidenced by the fact that during her questioning by a Senate Committee, Haspel refused to state that use of torture by the CIA was immoral.
Under sustained questioning, all that senators could extract from her was an acknowledgement that she had no problem with following the current CIA field manual which bans the use of torture. In other words, the would-be director of the CIA magnanimously agreed that, as CIA director, she has no objection to following the law.
Talk about meeting minimum standards.
[caption id="attachment_416955" align="alignleft" width="515"] Suzanne Scott: the new chief executive of Fox News[/caption]
There is a sizeable body of legal and political opinion that believes she should have been jailed for her acts in covering up the CIA torture programme. At a minimum, she should have been permanently demoted. As should any other CIA officials engaged in the cover-up of the programme. Male or female.
Arizona Senator John McCain, one of the few Republicans who has refused to move his moral goalposts to meet the miserly standards of the Trump administration, urged his fellow senators not to vote for Haspel. Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality was disqualifying, he said.
While she is an experienced and capable FBI veteran who worked her way to its upper ranks, she is a dissembler and someone who has willingly used torture to obtain information from suspects. On that she’s at one with Mike Pompeo, the current secretary of state, and John Bolton, the national security adviser. And president Donald Trump.
In fact, her responses very clearly semaphored to Trump that should he feel the inclination to bang out one of his executive orders allowing torture, she’d have no compunction about using it as an ‘interrogation tool’.
Haspel has shown herself to be a woman who’s prepared to ‘go along to get along’ in a male-dominated world, no matter how repugnant its rules may be. There are plenty of brilliant, capable women – and men - in the CIA who do not defend or equivocate over this shameful stain on the agency’s record. It’s nauseating to see the advancement of women being used as a fig leaf by Democratic and Republican senators who voted for her. Morality and integrity should be gender-blind.
Meanwhile over at Fox News, it seemed fitting that Roger Ailes, a bully and serial sexual harasser of Fox employees, should be replaced by a woman. The appointment of a capable, courageous female chief executive would be an important step in redressing the institutionalised misogyny in right-wing cable news.
If only. The appointment of Scott doesn’t mark the end of a chapter in the condoning of repugnant male behaviour at Fox. Rather it represents its continuum.
Ailes was ousted in 2016 amid numerous sexual harassment allegations that also ended the career of Bill O’Reilly, Fox News’s best-known pundit. Between them, the angry icons of Republican white male privilege cost the network upwards of $150 million in settlements with shareholders and female employees whom they sexually harassed.
Both men were omnipotent within the Fox News organisation for decades and were considered Trump’s most influential backers in 2016.
Their downfall was the mini-earthquake that launched the #MeToo and #TimesUp tsunami that swept away systems that protected male sexual predators at the pinnacle of the film, television, media and political arenas. Except for Donald Trump, an unreconstructed misogynist who has thus far proven immune to charges of financial, political or sexual impropriety.
According to court documents, Scott was complicit in the cover-up of dozens of allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault and bullying against Ailes and O’Reilly and countless other Fox News anchors and executives. She is named in many of the harassment claims against the network. Female producers and journalists this reporter spoke with who work or have worked at Fox News are dismayed by her promotion.
Female staffers who have sued Fox News name her as Ailes’s enabler and enforcer in creating a toxic workplace environment for women. From instituting his mini-skirt dress code for women to orchestrating an on-air retaliation campaign to discredit Gretchen Carlson and other female staffers who objected to Ailes and Fox anchor Bill O’Reilly’s sexual harassment, Scott was complicit in preserving and enabling a poisonous and humiliating work environment for women.
Carlson, a former anchor whose courage exposed the seamy underbelly of institutionalised predatory behaviour at Fox, eventually received a $20 million payout years after her career was derailed by Ailes for resisting his unwanted sexual advances.
Scott should have been fired for her role in the Roger Ailes cover-up, not promoted. Likewise, with Gina Haspel. In one sense, both Fox and the CIA have raced to the bottom to reach equality. They are applying the same moral standards for women and men - ie none.
Ivanka Trump likes to point to how her father promotes women. Nonsense. Her father promotes women who enable and flatter him. If they challenge him, they are besmirched as ugly, overweight or unattractive and castigated as liars.
In the same way, the elevation of Ivanka Trump from executive of a family property business and owner of a mid-market fashion and accessories line to top White House adviser who now holds forth on matters of global magnitude is not a victory for women. It is a victory for nepotism and for women who enable the worst excesses of their male counterparts and bosses - who are complicit in the mistreatment of other women.
The same goes for Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and the women who shamefully defended accused child molester Judge Roy Moore’s attempt to become the senator for Alabama.
[caption id="attachment_416954" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Senator John McCain urged his fellow senators not to vote for Haspel[/caption]
This is not about ideology. There are plenty of courageous, capable Republican women. Whether or not you agree with her political viewpoints, Nikki Haley is a great role model for young women. So is Susan Collins, the Maine senator. So are countless dozens more.
But gender doesn’t compensate for fundamental character flaws.
Michelle Wolf - the gutsy comedian whose roasting of the media and the political establishment at this year’s White House Correspondent’s dinner caused a phony uproar - acerbically cited White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders as an example of a female ‘Uncle Tom’ for white women who disappoint other white women.
Anyone who has seen Hulu’s acclaimed series The Handmaid’s Tale or read Margaret Atwood’s novel will have understood her withering reference to Aunt Lydia when castigating Sanders, who willingly acts as Trump’s attack dog and perpetrates his lies about his female critics.
But there are plenty of other Aunt Lydias in the Trump administration. And women shouldn’t seek to defend an act or utterance by a woman that if perpetrated by a man would lead to his castigation.

How the government’s unlucky 13 was halted
Sunday Business Post

Length: 1016 words
Byline: Mary Regan
Highlight: The plan to set the ‘digital age of consent’ at 13 followed a poor level of public engagement and concerns over the undue influence of tech companies on government policy 
Body


‘Céad mile fáilte” was written on white letterings against a pale blue backdrop at the Facebook headquarters in Silicon Valley last November. It was one of a number of posters carrying colourful niceties such as “be bold”, “listen as much as you speak” and “inclusion is within everyone’s ability.”
In front of the colourful wall, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar beamed with Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, who was announcing several hundred jobs and a multimillion-euro expansion at the Facebook headquarters in Dublin’s Silicon Docks. After the photo-op, they sat down for a private meeting. In response to a subsequent parliamentary question from Micheál Martin, the Taoiseach said they did not have “any substantive discussions on regulatory matters” during their chat.
The November meeting was not the first interaction between both men. When he became Taoiseach, Varadkar received a personal note from Zuckerberg describing its office in Dublin as “an important part of our global community” and thanking him for taking part in a photoshoot there to highlight the company’s parental leave policy.
When Varadkar became Taoiseach, Facebook and other social media sites also became an important client of the government. It spent €76,000 to promote Project Ireland 2040 across Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
The spend on social media to promote Bliain na Gaeilge was €1.35 million last year, for Healthy Ireland it was €5 million and its failed campaign to bring the Rugby World Cup to Ireland spent €6,500 on social media ads. This contrasts to 2016, before Varadkar became Taoiseach, when the government spent zero on social media advertising.
From Facebook, the government gets well-paid jobs in the capital, photo opportunities and a platform to market its work. From the government, Facebook gets a talented workforce, low tax and weak regulation for its European office base. Given their mutual reliance it is fair to raise questions about whether politicians can be honest brokers when it comes to policies that affect the bottom line of big tech.
For this reason, it is no wonder that suspicions were raised over the government’s plans to set the digital age of consent at 13, which was stopped in its tracks by a Dáil vote last week. The Dail defeat for the government - and victory for many working in the area of children’s rights - followed a less than adequate process of consultation and a poor level of understanding among the public about what was planned.
Put simply, the government tried to push laws through the Dáil that would allow tech companies to permanently own everything that a child, from the age of 13, puts up about themselves online. Companies like Facebook, or gaming sites, could permanently store all the photographs they put up, messages with their friends, records of their locations and movements. They could use this information to sell ads or push products on those children and, essentially, to make money.
Throughout this debate, there seemed to be a perception in public debate that the age of consent was about the age at which teenagers should be allowed online. But this has nothing at all to do with access to the internet. It is about what companies like Facebook do with the information that children share once they are online.
The government had significant cover for its proposal from organisations like the ISPCC and the Children’s Rights Alliance who had supported the proposal to set it at 13.
But at a closer look, the consultation process was far from thorough. For a start, it lasted just one month, meaning some organisations missed the deadline and had to follow up with the justice minister after the process was closed. The Children’s Rights Alliance represents more than one hundred organisations.
Following some probing by columnist and satirist Oliver Callan, the organisation conceded that it made the recommendation of 13 to the government even though the vast majority of its members did not take a position. One of its members, the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) wanted it set at 16, while another, the Teacher’s Union of Ireland (TUI) thought 13 was too low.
CARI - the organisation which is at the front line of providing counselling not only to children who are victims of abuse but those who are displaying risky sexual behaviour towards other children, recommended an age of 15. It said there was a “growing phenomenon” of children themselves posing a risk of abuse, because of the mixed messages about consent that they are getting online, and pornographic content being targeted at them.
An Garda Síochána also recommended that the age should be 16, but raised to 18 when the material related to sexual activity.
The Royal College of Physicians Faculty of Pediatrics missed the consultation and subsequently wrote to the Minister for Justice expressing concern that the age was being set at 13.
It said children and teenagers “may lack comprehension of the significant risks and consequences of sharing personal data, including photographs” and “may not have the judgement/maturity to understand the consequences of inappropriate disclosure of feelings and personal thoughts on the internet.” It said: “This behaviour may lead to significant feelings of regret, worry and anxiety.”
TDs and senators lived up to their legislative responsibility and listened to these concerns. The age of consent was debated at length in the Dáil, Seanad and in committee rooms of Leinster House. On Wednesday night, Labour and Fianna Fail joined forces to propose an amendment to set the age at 16. They were supported by Sinn Féin, and the government’s plan for 13 was defeated by 56 votes to 51.
This is the sort of legislative process we were promised when an inconclusive election result left us with what was known as “new politics” two years ago: Parties working across the divide to ensure that the Dáil was not merely a place to rubber stamp government decisions, where laws are made following careful consideration, consultation and compromise.
In this case, it is a law that will be in the long-term interest of children.

How Tom Murphy attacked the arrogance of power

Length: 1047 words
Byline: Tom McGurk
Highlight: The Tuam-born dramatist came out of a landscape devastated by the Famine and its legacy of mass emigration. His work raged, in his own words, ‘against the inequalities of life’ 
Body


When Tom Murphy, who died last week aged 83, began writing he immediately turned to the two major defining Irish subjects, the Great Famine and emigration, for his material and inspiration. Considering his earliest dramatic preoccupations, he could hardly have been born in a more significant locale. His native place, Tuam in Co Galway, was an historic famine hinterland and had been devastated by emigration. It continued to be so as he grew up.
From the outset, Murphy recognised his enormous personal sense of anger, if not betrayal, and it marked his work throughout his lifetime. He said in an interview once: “There is a rage in me which I think is a natural thing. It was in me when I was 24 or 25, scribbling with my stub of a pencil. And it’s still there in everything I do. Rage not against the unfairness of life – life is of course unfair – but against the inequalities, the arrogance of power.”
The youngest of ten children who, like their father, emigrated to work in England, Murphy was eventually left alone at home with his mother. It was 1950s Ireland, suffering under the final years of de Valera’s failing economic policy. For many, the independence revolution had achieved very little. Ireland seemed only to be a place where both cattle and people were transported to England. The Church ruled and imposed the strictest orthodoxies, even on the imagination.
Although it was just over a century on from the Great Famine, its complex legacy persisted in many ways. The Famine had been much more than a starvation crisis. While it had killed or exiled a great swathe of the population, its devastation also had immense societal, cultural and psychological implications for the entire nation.
It produced generations bowed down by guilt and fear and for many it even broke their connection with Mother Earth. A century later, despite having being for two generations a post colonial nation, Ireland still suffered a paralysis of self-esteem.
Emigration has been such a common experience for us Irish that it is probably now only in retrospect that we can begin to get some sense of the dimensions of its influence. Imagine one day saying goodbye to your children, bringing them to the train or the boat, with the real possibility of never seeing them again.
They became the living dead, the children who turned into mere letters home, or cards at Christmas time. We called them exiles. They inspired an entire culture of loss and longing as they tried to recreate their familiar habitats in Coventry, Chicago or Canberra. Their legacy of loss and anger moves through Murphy’s drama, their diminished lives and broken families, the children reared while their fathers worked overseas. Just as Murphy himself was.
In 1950s Ireland, when Murphy began writing, few publicly attacked the great defining orthodoxies of the day, except for a small band of writers who were in turn regularly censored. They included, in the beginning, Seán Ó Faoláin and Patrick Kavanagh and, later, Edna O’Brien and John McGahern. Murphy was soon to join their number.
Early in his career, the rejection by the Abbey Theatre of his play A Whistle in the Dark was to become emblematic of the cultural and civic civil war that was soon to consume him. Ironically it was rejected by Ernest Blythe who, many could argue, had been one of the leaders of the counter- revolution in his previous political life and then continued it into his cultural life when he secured the directorship of the Abbey as a sinecure.
Murphy’s play about an Irish immigrant family in Coventry portrayed significant levels of tribal violence. In his rejection letter, Blythe told Murphy that “no such people exist in Ireland”. Murphy was soon to make audiences very familiar with such people in Ireland.
Irish dramatic history was to be repeated when the play was premiered by Joan Littlewood at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East; some years earlier, Brendan Behan’s The Quare Fellow, also turned down by the Abbey, had had its London premiere there.
Throughout his writing life, Murphy’s drama continued to generate controversy and argument. In 1975, The Sanctuary Lamp premiered at the Abbey Theatre and it provoked an intense reaction, getting accused of being anti-Catholic. Murphy was deeply hurt and, for some time, seemed to be on the point of abandoning his craft entirely.
But in 1983 with The Gigli Concert and in 1985 with Bailegangaire, his great verbal masterpiece, he produced two great modern Irish dramas. There was still the great brooding darkness and the sense of expectation in his works, but beyond naturalism he began to experiment in form and content in the mythical and the surreal.
Deeply involved all his life with music, with plays like Bailegangaire Murphy’s drama began to sing, displaying his magnificent command of theatrical language. Like Beckett before him, as his oeuvre progressed, his theatrical language sounded almost as important as what it said.
Over the last 50 years, the Republic has been convulsed by a transition from a deeply conservative, religion-dominated state to become a secular province of the new European neo-liberal experiment. We are an ancient people with a complex cultural relationship with both the Irish and English languages giving our art its unique positioning.
It has all been a difficult and painful transition; we have seemingly spent aeons in debate about who and what we now are. Murphy’s dramaturgy has been a significant accompaniment to this process. As ever, art survives as a meditation on our life and times.
In this, Murphy followed a historic tradition. For a long time, drama has played a significant part in Irish public life and affairs. In the years before the revolution, especially in the prelude to 1916, drama exercised an important role in the national debate.
Murphy and Brian Friel were our most important post-war dramatists. Both were writers of enormous honesty, integrity and compassion. Both emerged in the 1960s social revolution. And both were the principal architects of magnificent theatrical achievements.
We were enormously lucky to have them document where we have come from and raise questions about where we are going. Once again, with Tom Murphy’s death, we are vividly reminded of the unique and defining role of art in our lives.

IDA widens net of companies it is targeting in Britain

The IDA is expanding the range of companies and industries it is targeting for relocation from Brexit Britain, a senior agency official has told The Sunday Business Post.
Denis Curran, who is head of financial services with the inward investment body, said: “We’re seeing Brexit opportunities across the entire IDA portfolio.
“Brexit . . . is opening up new opportunities that heretofore didn’t exist. It’s redefining the contestable market for us,” he said, pointing to pharmaceutical and broadcasting operations as major growth areas. “Anything that touches on a European regulatory service is coming into play as a potential mobile investment.”
He said that in addition to outfits seeking to leave London or diversify outside of Britain, inbound companies which previously would not have conducted due diligence on locations outside the British capital are now becoming realistic targets for the agency.
Within his own brief, financial services, the agency is now looking to attract players from beyond the traditional Irish industry strongholds.
“If you look at the portfolio of international financial services firms here, the companies fall into four or five categories. They’re either corporate investment banks, cross-border insurance, funds/asset management, fintech and payments; then you’ve got aircraft leasing,” he said.
“What we would see is things opening up from a new contestable market: trading, specific insurance products, rating agencies. Within our financial services sector, those are the trends we’re seeing at the moment.”
Curran admitted that many of the banks and other companies eyeing Ireland are concerned about the crisis in the housing market. “Everyone knows the current status of the housing situation,” he said.
“They’re very keen to know what are the plans to improve the supply of housing. They take comfort in the fact that it is a policy priority for government.”
He also praised the Central Bank, which has on occasion been criticised for its approach to new entrants who require regulation. Last year, this newspaper obtained minutes of a meeting between then-jobs minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor and Central Bank governor Philip Lane in which she twice said that the financial regulator was being blamed for blocking Brexit jobs, and there was an impression that the Central Bank was “closed for business”.
Late last year, the Irish Independent published a letter from financial services minister Michael D’Arcy to Lane which accused the bank of adopting an “unhelpful attitude”, and of “unclear processes” that often resulted in “lengthy delays” for firms considering relocation.
“What clients crave is knowledge, information and certainty around processes and timelines,” Curran said. “The [Central] Bank has been very forthcoming in sharing information around those.”
Curran said he expected more positive relocation news in the near term. “There are a number of entities who have confirmed to us they’ve chosen Ireland, they’re engaged in the regulatory processes at the moment and hopefully they’ll go public in the next couple of quarters.”

IPL’s flotation could be hit by plastics industry problems, investors say

Headwinds for the plastics industry could drag the price range for Irish-Canadian IPL’s initial public offering lower than many investors expect when it comes to the market next month.
Investors who spoke to The Sunday Business Post after green-lighting IPL’s plan to float on the Toronto exchange believe that the company could value its shares in a range between €2.10 and €2.25 when it makes clear its plans to shareholders next week.
However, the sector has been battered in recent months, leading some to believe that IPL’s management team will display caution and price the float below the level that many hope for.
Some analysts speculated that the IPO could value the company at a multiple of as much as nine times earnings, but others suggested a less ambitious target would be more likely.
“We have seen multiple compression in recent months in this sector,” said Cantor Fitzgerald research analyst William Heffernan.
“From a multiple perspective, we were seeing eight times Ebitda [earnings], and sometimes closer to nine times. That may have moved lower in recent months.”
“We get the general impression that management is approaching the IPO in a prudent manner, which is welcome.”
Market watchers said that a lower price point for the IPO would also potentially leave headroom for the company’s share price to expand rapidly upwards after the IPO is completed next month.
A spokesperson for the company said that it had no comment on its pricing for the IPO, which will be published and sent to shareholders next week.
Investors in the company - formerly known as One51 - of which there are more than 2,000, voted to approve its plans to list on the Toronto stock exchange last week.
Chief executive Alan Walsh said last Tuesday that he expects shareholders to decline to participate in a €50 million share buyback programme, with many in fact expressing interest in buying more shares when the company floats.
The company has undergone a major transformation under Walsh’s stewardship, transforming from a conglomerate with interests as diverse as ferry companies and metal recycling to a more streamlined plastics specialist.

Irish Times rejects pay restoration appeals

The Irish Times has rejected union appeals for full pay restoration, and has instead proposed offering staff a one-off payment and a voluntary redundancy scheme.
In a letter to Seamus Dooley, vice chair of the Dublin Printing Group of Unions, Majella Gallagher, human resources director at the Irish Times, said it noted the union’s continued aspiration for pay restoration following a meeting with the Irish Times Group of Unions on May 8.
“As advised at our meeting, it is not possible for us to accede to this request at this time. This is because it is not financially viable for us to do so due to the ongoing uncertainty in the media industry,” Gallagher said in the letter.
The Irish Times also rejected a suggestion of partial pay restoration as it said it did not believe it was “prudent to increase our cost base based on our revenue trends and the volatility of our industry”.
The company offered an alternative pay proposal which will include a 1.5 per cent one-off pensionable payment of annual base salary and an additional flat payment of about €1,600 per person.
According to the Irish Times, this allows for an increase ranging between 4.7 per cent and 6.2 per cent in gross remuneration paid to staff members in 2018.
It said the pay proposal was structured in a way that did not put it at risk of an ongoing increased cost base.
The Irish Times also proposed to review existing grading structures in editorial, technology and on clerical administrative grades, which it said would provide further opportunity for pay increments.
In the letter, Gallagher said a number of individuals had requested a voluntary parting package. It proposed to reopen the package, which would include four weeks per year of service, inclusive of statutory redundancy, with a cap of 104 weeks. It said applications would only be accepted if it was operationally feasible to do so and payback terms made business sense.
The proposal is currently being considered by union members.

The ISPCC said its €2 million partnership with Vodafone did not influence its decision to advocate to keep the digital age of consent at the age of 13.
The child protection charity received €400,000 from Vodafone last year as part of a five-year partnership which includes €2 million in direct funding as well as a commitment by the company to cover the cost of Childline phone services for ten years.
It was one of the organisations supporting the government’s position to keep the digital age of consent at 13. The proposal was voted down in the Dáil on Wednesday meaning the age from which companies can keep users’ data will be 16.
Asked if the Vodafone funding influenced its decision, a spokesperson for the ISPCC said: “Absolutely not. We take our policy positions from our experience, our child protection remit and what children say to us. None of our partnerships ever sought to influence our decisions, nor would we accept it if they did. We take our independence extremely seriously.”
The Children’s Rights Alliance (CRA), Barnardos and the Ombudsman for Children also supported setting the age at 13. The Garda, the child counselling service Cari, teachers’ unions and the professional body for paediatricians were among those who argued that age 13 was too low.
In a joint statement, Barnardos, the ISPCC and the CRA said the decision to set the age at 16 “will create significant risks to child safety, will not be enforceable and will remove the onus from industry to protect the children availing of their services”.
The groups have called on the government to appoint a digital safety commissioner with statutory powers.

Former taoiseach Enda Kenny has broken his silence to declare that Fianna Fáil has “no option” but to agree to a third budget with Fine Gael in October.
In his first public speech since resigning nearly a year ago, Kenny also called for the overhaul of the methods by which serious issues are reported to ministers.
He made the comments at a book launch in Dublin last week amid the ongoing furore over ministers not being made aware of issues with the CervicalCheck programme.
Kenny said at the event last Tuesday night that, “in due course, an election will be called or an election will be caused”.
He told an audience of mostly Fine Gael supporters: “I think the Fianna Fáil party has signed on for three budgets. I think they have no option but to go through with that in their own interest, and I think government – and Minister for Finance and Public Service is here, Paschal [Donohoe] – will obviously commit to working with the parties in the interests of the country.”
While stressing that he was not commenting on “any issue at the moment”, Kenny said he had always felt that where issues should be brought to the attention of ministers, they should be the subject of a direct memo from a department secretary general “so there wouldn’t be any issue of whether people were actually told at the very highest level or not”.
There has been criticism of the fact that neither Taoiseach Leo Varadkar nor Minister for Health Simon Harris were made aware by Department of Health officials of issues with the CervicalCheck programme prior to the scandal becoming public last month.
Kenny said: “It’s an easy thing to do, if there’s an issue that requires ministerial attention, that it be the subject of a memo to the secretary general and from the secretary general to minister x or y so that he or she is properly informed.”
The Mayo TD, who resigned as taoiseach last June and is retiring from the Dáil at the next election, was speaking at the launch of Secrets of the Ballot Box, a book about the Irish voting system written by long-time Fine Gael activist Brendan Heneghan.
Kenny also paid tribute to former tánaiste Eamon Gilmore, suggesting that when the Fine Gael-Labour government came into office there were just “six weeks left” before the country’s economic situation worsened.
“I just want to say publicly that what we had to do in dealing with the extent of debt and difficulty for this country in 2011 couldn’t have happened without Eamon Gilmore and his party. Because the fact that we had six weeks left before the situation – which Paschal Donohoe has now has inherited much to his credit – was very unpalatable and left us with really lousy decisions to be made. We had to get on with that and just do it.”

Multiple All-Ireland-winning Kerry footballer Darran O’Sullivan has issued legal proceedings against a number of newspapers owned by Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch, court records show.
The Glenbeigh-Glencar forward has filed an action against Times Newspapers Ltd, which publishes the Sun, as well as against News Group Newspapers Ltd, which publishes the Times daily edition and the Sunday Times. The case is believed to relate to a misidentification of O’Sullivan in a news story.
According to his LinkedIn page, O’Sullivan is currently the managing director of Rosspoint bar and restaurant, which is located on Rossbeigh beach on the Ring of Kerry.
O’Sullivan also spent nearly three years as an ‘athlete mentor’ for the Sky Sports Living for Sport initiative, which used high-profile athletes to teach sport and exercise to secondary school children. The programme ended in August 2017. Sky Sports is also owned by Murdoch.
O’Sullivan has been a member of the Kerry panel since 2005, and has won eight Munster titles in his career and four All-Irelands.
O’Sullivan could make his first appearance of this year’s championship next month, when Kerry line out in the Munster semi-final against either Clare or Limerick at Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney.
O’Sullivan is represented by Kerry solicitors’ firm Harrison O’Dwyer, one of whose partners is John O’Dwyer, the son of the legendary former Kerry football manager Mick O’Dwyer.

Kilkenny Group family feud:“Not one of my siblings reached out to me to find out what happened"

Highlight: As the bitter feud engulfing the Kilkenny Group dynasty edges towards a Commercial Court showdown, businessman Greg O’Gorman breaks his silence on his ‘humiliating’ dismissal
Body


For Greg O’Gorman, the nightmare began on Friday, July 8, 2016. The Kilkenny Group marketing manager was finishing up work at about half four or five in the evening when his father, Michael O’Gorman, phoned him from Dungarvan where he was playing a round of golf with friends.
His father, to whom he was close, wanted to know if his eldest son had received any post or had made it home yet that evening. When O’Gorman replied in the negative, his father told him that he had just got word that a letter had been sent to his house, dismissing him from his job at the family business.
In disbelief at the news, the 41-year-old drove to his home in Blarney and found the hand-delivered, “no-fault” dismissal letter waiting for him.
Signed by his mother, Marian O’Gorman, founder and chief executive of the Kilkenny Group, it terminated his 13 years of employment at the company with immediate effect. The terms offered him a two-year severance package with three months salary in lieu of notice.
[caption id="attachment_416985" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] The Kilkenny Shop on Nassau Street in Dublin[/caption]
For O’Gorman, who says he put in 80-hour weeks and at one stage believed he was being primed by his mother for the top job at the family firm, this “cold letter” came as a bolt from the blue.
“My wife was there. Her sister was there; she was down for the weekend. They were in shock. I left the house immediately, said I had to go. I went away and literally cried for about 30 minutes outside my children’s school in the car. I just couldn’t believe what was happening.”
O’Gorman is the grandson of the late Christy Kelleher, founder of the Blarney Woollen Mills Group, which acquired the flagship Kilkenny Design store opposite Trinity College on Nassau Street in Dublin when it was sold by the government.
In 1999, following a long-running boardroom dispute in the family business, Blarney was broken up into competing entities, with Marian O’Gorman taking the helm at the Kilkenny Group, which currently has an online business and 15 outlets, employing about 300 people.
Greg O’Gorman joined the business in 2003, working his way up to group marketing manager.
He claims that under his watch, from 2010 to 2016, turnover soared from €18 million to €30 million and profits increased fivefold to €1.5 million.
He alleges he worked tirelessly, below his due pay grade, all the while taking comfort in his mother’s repeated assertions that growth in the value of the company would be his ultimate reward.
When the immediate shock of being fired abated, O’Gorman took stock and sought redress.
He made a legal strike to try to stop his dismissal, and separately sought court affirmation that he has a quarter stake in Kilkenny which he has valued at €12.5 million. Both suits are ongoing.
O’Gorman, a father of three children all under the age of ten, has claimed in the proceedings that he and his young family have been left “financially destitute” by his mother’s actions.
He is currently unemployed, on social welfare and borrowing from friends. The one positive he has drawn from the experience is a newfound closeness to his children.
When I speak to O’Gorman about his dismissal, he says that in retrospect there were signs that all was not as it should have been in the flourishing retail business.
At an executive meeting just weeks before he was let go, Marian O’Gorman allegedly read a prepared statement to the effect that the company would no longer be run or referred to as a “family business”.
He says that, while legal proceedings block him from freely discussing some of the alleged disputes and boardroom tensions, his mother’s alleged actions were in flagrant breach of a signed family partnership agreement that the Kilkenny Group was being held in trust for him and his three younger siblings, Michelle, Melissa and Christopher.
Marian O’Gorman is expected to argue in court that the 2010 family agreement he relies on was an aspirational document without binding effect.
Greg O’Gorman’s siblings and his father, Michael, are notice parties to the acrimonious Commercial Court row which looks set to go to a full hearing after lengthy mediation and settlement talks failed. The parties are currently caught in a pre-trial wrangle over the discovery of various documents and company records.
Separately, at the time of his departure, O’Gorman claims the company was embroiled in various employment law disputes.
Reflecting on his dismissal, O’Gorman says he stood up to his mother, probably to the extent that he became a thorn in her side, and ultimately paid the price.
In court filings, he alleges he confronted Marian when his younger brother Christopher came to him upset in January 2016 having allegedly been told by her that he would no longer be receiving a family dividend from the company, as she had changed her mind.
[caption id="attachment_416986" align="alignleft" width="694"] Greg O’Gorman with his mother Marian in happier times[/caption]
O’Gorman says he let it be known that, as chief executive, his mother did not have the authority to make a unilateral decision without consulting the family partnership. He says a U-turn on the bonus was achieved with the help of his father.
He also claims he supported his sister Melissa when her mother moved her from her position as general manager from the Kilkenny Shop on Nassau Street in 2015.
His allegations were put to the Kilkenny Group, including family members, who declined to comment.
For him, it is the ultimate irony that he now finds himself the black sheep of the family when he believes he tried his best to have his siblings’ backs.
I suggest to Greg that his estrangement from the rest of his family might suggest that it is him and not his mother who has proved difficult or out of line to some degree.
“I can understand that might be the perception, but once I was fired not one of my siblings reached out to me to find out what happened or to ask: ‘What’s your side of the story?’,” he says.
He also refers back to the 1999 Blarney split between his mother and her three brothers, pointing out that the current fractious row is by no means the first in the family empire.
He says Kelleher, his late grandfather, would be “ashamed and appalled” at what is happening.
An especially bitter twist for O’Gorman is that his father, who he says was his closest ally, recently reconciled with Marian, leaving Greg even further out in the cold.
While he claims to have support from “some very good people”, he says his “no fault” dismissal has tarnished his reputation and led to unfounded rumours among locals and business associates.
His aim now is to “clear [his] name” and put this behind him.
Asked if he believes in a future family reconciliation, he replies that “time is a great healer”.
“I don’t see any chance of that happening while this is ongoing. But I do think when all of this is done and there is a line drawn, and people have some time to reflect and can move on with their lives, then anything is possible.”

The construction and fit-out company Mac Group, which counts Facebook, EY, and Hibernia Reit among its clients, will hire another 50 staff this year, bringing its total number of employees to 190.
The company has won contracts for a number of new projects include a €22 million greenfield logistics centre build for Mountpark in Baldonnell, Co Dublin; a €29 million, 110,000 square foot brownfield development in Dublin 2; and a £30 million hotel conversion comprising retail, offices and external works in Liverpool.
Its current fit-out projects include a €7 million contract on Molesworth Street for Barclay’s, a 13,400 square foot fit-out in Dublin Landings in the docklands and a £9 million refurbishment for international investor-developer Quadrum on London’s Dartmouth Street.
Tiffany Quinn, Mac Group’s marketing and communications director, said the company was established in 2002 as a specialist fit-out contractor, but it has evolved to also take on construction work.
It has two offices in Britain, one in Birmingham and one in London, as well as the HQ in Dublin.
Quinn said the company ensured that it was not over- reliant on the Dublin market or even the Irish one.
“We have a geographic spread throughout Ireland. We work in Limerick, Donegal, Galway, but we also have a lot of work in Britain now,” she said.
“We will go anywhere for a client. We have done work in Holland for AbbVie, in Munich for Intel, in Germany for Facebook.
“If we have a client here in Ireland and they want to do something in Europe or elsewhere we will do that for them.”

Marley prepares to declare personal insolvency

Highlight: Marley has debts of €9.6 million
Body


Philip Marley, the colourful businessman, has appointed accountants to advise him on making a proposal to creditors for a personal insolvency arrangement.
Marley had faced the threat of bankruptcy from Maven Capital Partners, one of his creditors, but his decision to appoint Dublin-based accountants Francis Brophy & Company to advise him may allow him to avoid this.
Documents prepared as part of this process show Marley has debts of €9.6 million owed to Nama, the former Anglo Irish Bank, Maven and others. Marley states he has property investments, including his principal private residence, worth a combined €580,000.
He also claims he has “prospective assets” worth €7 million. Documents state this €7 million asset is a “fintech start-up providing an application for tourists to reclaim Vat on purchases made across Europe. The valuation is based inward investment being handled by an independent accounting firm acting on behalf of the investor”.
Marley declined to comment on his personal insolvency arrangement or give any more detail on what is described as a €7 million asset.
Marley owes €1 million to Nama and €2.4 million to National Westminster Bank. Both of these debts are described as being on foot of a personal guarantee.
A British venture capital fund is listed as being owed €1 million. IBRC, the former Anglo Irish Bank, is listed as being owed €4 million on foot of a personal guarantee.
Permanent TSB is owed €400,000; Promontoria Finn, a Cerberus company, is owed €293,000 and Ulster Bank is owed €293,000.
Marley became a multimillionaire at the age of 33 when he floated his business Ely Property Group on the AIM stock exchange in London in 2005. After the crash, he became embroiled in various controversies. One of his creditors, Maven, complained about spending on trips to Las Vegas and tanning salons.
Marley has denied all wrongdoing in relation to his business affairs. In February he told The Sunday Business Post: “As you are well aware, I was actively involved in real estate from 2003 and was damaged like many others with the property crash of 2008.
“I am proud to say that I have managed to reduce €40 million of personal guarantees significantly to what is now circa €5.5 million.
“I have worked with creditors for ten years now and avoided bankruptcy, unlike most of my peers that were also in real estate.”

Adventurer Gregor McGuckin is seeking support from Irish businesses to become the first Irish person to sail non-stop around the world by completing the prestigious Golden Globe Race 2018.
Only one person, Robin Knox-Johnston, has ever completed this epic race, which has only been run once before in 1968. McGuckin is the second youngest of 18 sailors attempting the challenging race.
“It is going to take eight months to complete but the first battle is to get to the starting line by doing the right planning, training and fundraising,” McGuckin said. He said he was seeking financial support from Irish businesses to take on the race which he estimated would cost €200,000 to complete.
He said well-known businessmen Enda O’Coineen and Ulick McEvaddy had already signed up to support him in the race which starts on July 1 in France. Technology company Arkphire and educational group CJ Fallon are also among his sponsors.
“It will be tough. There will be eight months of solitude and the challenges of the sea in all conditions from the tropics to cold waves and strong winds of the southern ocean. There will undoubtedly be hairy conditions,” the 31-year-old said.
McGuckin said that all food used on the trip had to be carried on board to complete the 27,000-mile-long voyage.
O’Coineen, who recently completed his own solo circumnavigation of the globe in two goes, said you have to be very organised to survive and succeed. “People say we’re stone mad - but stones sink,” he said.
“Going to the edge is all about organisation, preparation, planning and of course the business side in getting the money to pay for it all. It’s brilliant to have the support of Malahide boat yard and its owner Ulick McEvaddy, a great business entrepreneur.”
McEvaddy is best known for founding Omega Air along with his brother Des which is a leader in commercial in-flight refuelling services.
McGuckin is being supported in his endeavours by Team Ireland run by EnCircle Ocean who are using their collective experience in fundraising and education to help him prepare for the race. He is also promoting Atlantic Youth Trust, a charity set up to connect Irish young people with the ocean.
McEvaddy said: “I thought I was a warrior until I met Gregor. We need to support him in his adventures and endeavours.”

Builder Paddy Byrne, whose company built the houses Millfield Manor in Kildare that burned down in 30 minutes, has been discharged from bankruptcy in Britain.
Byrne, who currently works for ambitious Dublin house builder Victoria Homes, applied for discharge from bankruptcy in March, which was granted by the court.
He remains bound by a bankruptcy restriction understanding, however, meaning he can still no longer act as a director in England or Wales until 2022.
He applied for bankruptcy in Britain in 2011 with debts of nearly €100 million. The British insolvency service extended his bankruptcy beyond the standard one-year duration, accusing him of not fully declaring all his assets.
In a statement at the time, the insolvency service said that Byrne had attempted to “cheat creditors”, in their characterisation, by making “several transfers from his personal account at the National Irish Bank to relatives or associates in informal and unwritten arrangements which, because of their undocumented nature, were impossible to prove”.
The insolvency service also claimed he had “failed to disclose a mortgage-free property in Holyhead, north Wales, worth approximately £76,000, of which he was the sole owner, claiming that this was an oversight”.
In the same period, Byrne was also restricted as a director in Ireland during the forced wind-up of a company called Future Structures, during which the liquidator sought court approval to restrict Byrne. That restriction ended in December 2017.
Byrne hit the headlines in 2015 when a row of six houses his company had built in Newbridge, Co Kildare, burned to the ground in approximately 30 minutes due to serious fire-safety deficiencies, which were later the subject of several investigations by Kildare County Council and the Department of Housing.
A recent report by the Department of Housing, seen by The Sunday Business Post, concluded that “the houses were not in compliance with the building regulations”, pointing to “poor workmanship and improper jointing of plasterboard to separating walls within the attic space”, “penetration of separating wall within attic with roof timbers”, “fire-stop missing at top of separating wall between cavity closer and roof felt”, missing cavity closers, missing cavity barriers, and the “stair enclosure in three-storey dwellings not carried up to underside of roof covering”.

Minister plans strategy to prepare IFSC for future technological disruption
Sunday Business Post
May 19, 2018

Minister of State for Finance Michael D’Arcy is drawing up new plans to future proof the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at a time of growing job threats from computer technology.
The current strategy is on track to deliver on its promise of creating 10,000 extra jobs in the IFSC in Dublin as well as regional centres in Limerick and Kilkenny by its 2020 deadline.
But there is a real risk that lower-end jobs in financial services could be lost due to the development of new computer software.
In an interview with The Sunday Business Post, D’Arcy said the new plan would be focused more on helping the IFSC adapt in the future to the challenges of new software technology, artificial intelligence and robots.
“We can’t ignore that technology is going to have a large impact. We’re really going to try to future proof this,” he said.
The hope is that the IFSC and other financial centres in the country can keep moving up the value chain, so that jobs are secured. Many financial sector workers are currently employed in managing funds collectively worth €4 trillion, but some of this work in future will be done by computers.
D’Arcy said one of the potential growth areas for the sector would be ‘sustainable green finance’, given that Ireland’s transition to a low carbon economy will require over €40 billion of new capital investment by 2050. He also said the sector could expand in areas such as regulating technology and cyber security.
“What we absolutely want to do is look down the road. We are going to talk to the major technology companies based here, like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, to see what their strategies are,” he said.
The current strategy had a target of increasing employment in financial services from 35,000 in 2015 to 45,000 by 2020. The most recent update on progress stated that the workforce was up to 42,000 already, so the jobs target will not only be achieved “but it may be surpassed”.
There are now 20 of the world’s top 25 financial services companies based here. And more than a dozen London-based firms have decided to move here so that they have guaranteed access to EU markets after Brexit.
D’Arcy got cabinet approval last week to start work on the new strategy for 2020-2025, with the aim of having a draft ready in the first quarter of next year. He said it would be ready well before the current plan expires in 2020.
“We’re going to do what we do really well, like fund administration and aviation finance. We’re going to make our offering even better than it is. But we will have add-ons in new areas like technology,” he said.

Motor Head: When the time came for me to buy a new car, Volkswagen’s doughty Touran people-carrier turned out to be just the job
Sunday Business Post

My family and I had no intention of buying a new car this year. Our 2009 Mazda5 MPV was well-suited to our needs, though we were vaguely planning on replacing it in the next couple of years for something better suited to life in Dublin city.
But then, the engine developed a very expensive and more or less terminal problem. The repair estimate was only a little less than the potential value of the car, so we had to look at our options carefully.
As it turned out, we were saved by the Volkswagen EcoGrant, as the Mazda, produced to Euro 4 emissions legislation, was eligible for the trade-in and scrap scheme (sadly now finished). Until we realised we could avail of it, we were at a crossroads, scratching our heads and wonder which direction to take.
I have three kids, two of them still on booster seats, so a people carrier works best for us, we’ve found. The sliding doors of the Mazda5 were great in tight parking spaces, especially when the kids were very small, but to get that in a new Volkswagen means the relatively expensive Sharan, which is larger than we need, in reality.
Hence, we decided that the Touran would perfectly fit the bill. It has three individual chairs in the middle row that can carry a child seat each, depending on their bulkiness. That means we have two extra seats out back for carrying friends or cousins when needs be, though most of the time they’re folded away and we have a huge boot to use.
As a bonus, I discovered that Frank Keane Volkswagen in Dublin had a car in the specification we wanted in stock, complete with integrated booster seats on the outer two chairs of the middle row. Parents, believe me: these are a game-changer. I can’t understand why more car makers don’t offer them on regular cars and not just MPVs.
Anyway, our next consideration was fuel type, though given the likely use of the car on a short daily commute (we’re shortly moving back to Dublin having been in a rural location for a year), it made sense to consider petrol power. Thankfully, the Touran can be had with a 1.2-litre TSI petrol engine, putting out 105hp.
Paired with a slick six-speed manual gearbox, it’s a smooth powertrain and noticeably quieter than the diesel alternative. Sure, it uses more fuel on a long motorway run (saying that, we’re averaging about 7.0 litres/100km – or 40mpg), but we expect lower long-term maintenance costs as we aim to do a lot less than 20,000 kilometres a year.
At the time of writing, we’re two months into ownership and very happy with the purchase. Our insurance premium has even been reduced. I’ve since sat down with a calculator and worked out that it would have been cheaper to buy a new car such as this on PCP finance, than to run our old one for the same length of time. That’s an eye-opening discovery, not one I would have expected. Worth considering if you find yourself at a car-buying crossroads any time soon.
Volvo was one of the first companies to declare its commitment to an electrified motoring future - and only last week confirmed that its next new car, the Volvo S60 saloon, will never feature a diesel engine - so it’s well on the path to offering a hybrid option in each of its model ranges.
I recently tested one of the newest on the Irish market, the XC60 T8. The XC60 is a high-quality and classy mid-sized SUV that competes with the likes of the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC, and I’m a fan of it with diesel power.
The plug-in hybrid T8 model feels even more lavish thanks to a high standard specification, but buyers pay for that, with a price north of €60,000 (including SEAI grant and VRT rebate). Included on the list of equipment is Volvo’s excellent air suspension, giving the XC60 a serene ride quality whether you’re on the motorway or dicing with city traffic on broken urban roads.
Actually, the latter scenario is this car’s forte, not because of its suspension, but because it’s a car that is only efficient if you regularly take the trouble to charge it up from an external source and then use it as an electric vehicle for as often as possible. That’s only doable for those that mostly cover short journeys, with time for charging in between. Which kind of makes the T8’s eye-opening 407hp and four-wheel-drive system surplus to requirements.
I used more fuel in this car in a week, including about 1,000 kilometres of fast motorway driving, than I would have done in the diesel version. Goes to show that buyers still need the choice of diesel power for some time to come, doesn’t it?

Beats Medical loses €120,000
Ciara Clancy’s Beats Medical made a loss of €120,880 in 2017, down from a loss of €218,953 in 2016, bringing its accumulated losses to €401,591.
Clancy - a chartered physiotherapist and former dancer - founded the company in 2012, aged 22, and it has developed an app that offers tailored treatments to people with Parkinson’s disease.
The company has raised funds from the likes of tech investor Sean Melly, David Crampton, Anthony Collins, and Dr Peter Boylan, the chairperson of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, as well as from Enterprise Ireland. Clancy was shortlisted for the EY Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2016.
The company behind George R R Martin’s Nightflyers series, which is being filmed in Troy Studios in Limerick, lobbied three government ministers over this year, writes Colette Sexton
NBCUniversal contacted Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe earlier this year. Culture minister Josepha Madigan and enterprise minister Heather Humphreys were copied in the correspondence.
The Lobbying Register shows that the aim of the correspondence was to update the ministers on the company’s investment in audiovisual production in Ireland; to highlight the potential contribution of the film and television sector to regional economic development and to suggest policy initiatives to encourage increased international investment in audiovisual production.
Ralph Lauren’s Irish arm saw its turnover drop by 5.75 per cent in 2017, but its income rose from €2.3 million to €3.3 million.
It pushed the company’s operating profit from €40,667 to €187,739, leaving it with accumulated profits of €606,570.
Its operating expenses rose by €745,103 - from €2.3 million to €3.1 million - in the same period, due to the opening of a new childrenswear store in Kildare Village. Its liabilities rose from €105,916 to €4.8 million, while it had €5.6 million in assets, €3 million of which was trade and other receivables. All of the company’s business is generated from its outlet store in Kildare Village, and the accounts state that its commission rates rose from 23 per cent to 34 per cent on its Irish sales. The company had 80 employees, up from 58 the year before, and a wage bill of €1.1 million.

No plans for DCC to offload health and technology divisions, says Murphy

DCC chief executive Donal Murphy has no plans to offload the company’s two smallest divisions - health and technology - as he aims to grow the firm even bigger over the next five years.
Murphy said that the company, which has already spent more than £670 million in acquisitions lately, with another £500 million in reserve for future deals, would in five years’ time “look broadly similar to the way it looks today, but hopefully a good bit bigger, growing organically and growing through acquisition”.
This means he is more likely to invest in his health and technology divisions rather than sell them off, as DCC did with its environmental business, which it sold for £219 million last year.
“When we look at the group, and this has been our philosophy for as long as we’ve existed and it is certainly top of my priorities, is to keep that diverse business model,” Murphy said.
“We just think there’s opportunities, really good opportunities, to grow and develop all four of our divisions,” pointing out that the healthcare and technology businesses contribute 14 per cent and 12 per cent of group profits respectively.
“There’s lots of opportunities to further deploy capital in the energy sector,” he conceded.
“But I also see the opportunities to deploy the capital in the healthcare tech sector and if lots more opportunities come along next year in tech and healthcare than they do in energy, it’ll be a bigger percentage.”
DCC has been going through a major phase of growth through acquisition lately. Last week, the company released its annual results, which showed it had grown its profits in the 12 months to March by 26.6 per cent to £316.4 million from £250 million.
Murphy told The Sunday Business Post that he was very pleased with the results, and that he expected next year’s results to show the real evidence of that expansion.
“It has been a record year from a capital deployment perspective,” he said.
“Six-hundred and seventy million pounds spent on acquisitions and a lot of those acquisitions were only completing at the end of the financial year.
“So we have the cost of them on our balance sheet, but we don’t have the profitability from them on our balance sheet yet - that will kick in in the current financial year.”
Murphy doesn’t believe the company will suffer any indigestion pains from the current rapid pace of deal-making in so many regions and across so many sectors.
“We’re pretty conservative when it comes to that. The last thing we’d want to do is to run too fast and trip ourselves up, so that’s very much a key part of our process and some businesses are are easier to acquire and absorb than other businesses.”

Highlight: By speaking from the heart, the Tánaiste and the Fianna Fáil leader have ended up taking the middle ground on the abortion debate 
Body


Simon Coveney has, in his own words, been “openly conflicted” about abortion. His very public jostling with his conscience at the start of the referendum campaign was treated with dismay by Yes campaigners and government colleagues who felt it put them on the back foot from the outset and played into the hands of the No side who argued that politicians were not be trusted to legislate on the issue.
But now some are realising that they should have listened to him sooner. As the campaign enters its final weeks, there is concern in government that this referendum might be too close for comfort. Their own research and feedback at the doorsteps is showing that a large cohort of voters are, in fact, in tune with Coveney’s way of thinking. That is, they are conflicted, they have reservations, but they are not resistant to change.
The Tánaiste, from being a liability, is now viewed as a useful asset in winning over the reluctant Yes vote. Securing the votes of this group will be essential to repealing the Eighth Amendment. With that in mind, Coveney is in demand.
He spoke at an event involving Doctors for Yes, which was also attended by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s partner Matt Barrett last week. He will appear at a rally with Varadkar in Athlone today and organisations advocating a Yes vote have been contacting him seeking his involvement in press conferences and other events in the final days of campaigning.
“I could have taken a very different path, I could have just said nothing or said to them: ‘This isn’t for me. I am pro-life and not pro-choice, I am doing my own thing’,” he told The Sunday Business Post.
[caption id="attachment_417038" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Simon Coveney: a hesitant campaigner for Yes Pic: Fergal Phillips[/caption]
Instead, in early February, the Tánaiste went on RTÉ Radio 1 and told Sean O’Rourke that he did not support the proposal to allow terminations without conditions up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, saying it was “not consistent with the state’s obligation to protect the unborn child”.
Just weeks later, he said he supported the government’s proposition but he believed future legislation on abortion should require a two-thirds Dáil majority - something that was slapped down by the Taoiseach as unconstitutional. Those around him realise that this call was an error of judgment. But on his public utterances about allowing terminations up to 12 weeks of a pregnancy, he has no regrets.
“I have not changed my position. I don’t accept that this is unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks,” he says. “We are not shifting to some kind of hyper-liberal, pro-choice position where we will have unrestricted access to terminations, which is what some people are suggesting is happening here. It is not. If it was, I would not be supporting this.”
Yet there is a sense of reticence about this support. Coveney is a hesitant Yes campaigner. He has not posed for pictures with anyone in a Repeal jumper. While he has canvassed door to door in his home county of Cork, he was not willing to have any journalists accompany him on the trip. He sees his position as a sensible and pragmatic one, but not as an ideological one.
“This was a real struggle for me,” he said. “But by being honest, by being open about being conflicted, by challenging myself, I hope that I will be able to give what I regard is still about 30 per cent of people who are undecided, the reassurance that they need to come out and vote for appropriate change by voting Yes.”
For Coveney, that reassurance centred around two issues. The first was that there would be no such thing as “unrestricted” abortion.
“After the Oireachtas committee report, I was uncomfortable with that recommendation around 12 weeks,” he says. The minister went about talking to doctors, to the health minister about the legislation and reassured himself that there were rules and protocols in place.
“There will be a requirement for both a woman and a doctor to sign a fully informed consent form or document, which would be ensuring that all the options have been outlined, all of the consequences of a termination have been talked through, if necessary counselling and support would be provided, if necessary a scan would be provided in terms of establishing the exact timelines of a pregnancy,” he says.
“Even after that period, if a woman wants to proceed with a termination, there would be a 72-hour delay period to ensure that [decision] has had full-time consideration and that nothing is rushed,” he says.
The second thing Coveney wanted to be sure of is something very personal to him. As the uncle of a niece with Down syndrome, he is fully satisfied that disability will not be allowed as grounds to terminate a pregnancy.
This is the reason why Coveney, during the course of the interview, consistently refers to ten weeks pregnant rather than 12 weeks gestation: “The term of the pregnancy is determined by the date of a woman’s last period. But the vast majority of pregnancies happen two weeks after this, that is when a woman is at her most fertile. So 12 weeks gestation in practical terms means ten weeks pregnant,” he says.
Coveney believes this is how it should be described in the legislation regulating terminations that will follow in the event of a Yes vote. “There are all sorts of reasons why this would be more appropriate, and Down Syndrome is one of them,” he says.
“One of the reasons I have made the distinction between ten weeks’ pregnancy versus 12 weeks’ gestation was for the very reason of not wanting to see a situation where people are looking for tests in advance of making a decision to terminate a pregnancy because of a diagnosis or a probability that a child may have Down syndrome.
He warns against the issue being exploited to “whip up” strong feelings. “This is a highly emotive issue for parents and families and I have very personal experience of that. So that is why this is something that I would be very conscious of trying to assure people on in the detail of the legislation,” he said.
“We need to try to deal with the Down syndrome issue in as comprehensive a way as we can in the legislation, and I am certainly committed to doing that.”
Another politician who came to the position of advocating for a Yes vote, following what he described as a “long and challenging” process of private deliberations, is the Fianna Fail leader and Coveney’s constituency colleague, Micheál Martin.
Any personal doubts he might have had have been cast aside. There were no signs of any reticence when he canvassed homes on the South Circular Road in Dublin city last Thursday morning enthusiastically advocating for Repeal of the Eighth Amendment.
In a departure from his previous position of being opposed to any change in the country’s abortion laws, Martin announced in the Dáil in January that he would advocate for Yes, something he says was primarily influenced by a meeting with four women who travelled to Britain for terminations after their babies were diagnosed with having no chance of life beyond birth.
Martin has joined Senator Catherine Ardagh on the Edwardian redbrick terrace of Raymond Street – a quiet and idyllic road just a stone’s throw from Dublin city centre, where older residents live alongside younger families in what is becoming one of the capital’s trendier neighbourhoods.
The issue of fatal foetal abnormalities is not one that comes up regularly on doorsteps, but is something the Fianna Fáil leader constantly reminds people of if they are unsure of what way they should vote.
“The main concern in our house is the 12 weeks,” says the first woman he encounters, a grandmother, who did not want to be named. “I always just thought No, but then again we’ve never really had to discuss it properly until now. It never comes up in conversation, but now we have to think about it, I’ve a lot of research to do.”
Martin describes his meeting with the women dealing with fatal foetal abnormalities, and tells her that a reluctant Yes is okay. This is something that he repeats throughout the day.
At the next house, another grandmother tells him that she is taking guidance from her 17-year-old granddaughter: “I am finding it very, very hard to make up my mind. I was definitely against it, and now I don’t know. I think the fairest thing to do would be to not vote at all. But then I think that might be a cop-out. I have to pray for guidance.”
“I don’t think the world is going to change. I don’t think you will see wholesale abortions,” Martin reassures her.
“Do you not think so? That’s what is worrying me,” she says.
Martin tells her it’s okay to “vote Yes with reservations”.
Martin’s position is at odds with the majority of his TDs and senators, but he believes the Fianna Fáil grassroots are split 50-50 on the issue. “There is no great antipathy,” he says when asked if there is a lot at stake for his leadership. “That is overestimated.
“Even within the parliamentary party, those who are voting No are quite comfortable with my position, and comfortable with the fact that there is freedom of conscience in the party.”
He is entirely comfortable with his own stance, and says it is one he can stand over: “In conscience I can’t stand over a law that forces women, particularly with fatal foetal abnormalities, to have to not only have to go through that trauma but to have the double trauma visited upon them by travelling to England. Likewise in cases of rape and incest. The more social workers I have spoken to, the more I have lived life, you realise these are not rare, these are not a few hard cases, there are quite a number of these cases out there.”
Martin has spent the past week in the capital canvassing for a Yes vote in Dublin South West with John Lahart, in Dublin Bay South with Jim O’Callaghan and with Catherine Ardagh in Dublin South Central. It is clear that his decision to declare his position early, ahead of other party leaders, is playing well in these areas.
On Raymond Street, he encounters Órla O’Donoghue, a young woman in a Repeal jumper who commends him for his “brave decision” to back a Yes vote. “I think he listened to women, and I admire him for that,” she says.
Another solid Yes voter, Barbara Dunne, also praised Martin’s Dáil speech. She is not sure it would make her vote for Fianna Fáil as a result, saying that the economic crash is still on her mind.
“I would vote based on political performance overall, and I still feel let down by Fianna Fáil. But his position on this issue makes me respect him more as a man,” she says.
Her words go to the heart of Martin’s gamble on backing a Repeal vote. People are unlikely to vote on the issue of abortion at the next election, and so he could reasonably calculate that his stance is unlikely to damage him among his party’s pro-life wing. But his decision has enhanced his appeal with young urbanites - a demographic where Fianna Fáil’s support is at its weakest.
Martin’s interactions with voters on the doorsteps of Raymond Street show why Fianna Fáil is unlikely to dump him as leader, even in the event of a No vote. He is a formidable campaigner and perhaps the party’s best asset.
The respective decisions by Martin and Coveney to speak from the heart mean that there will be a lot at stake for them politically in Friday’s vote. But they have shown themselves to be more in tune with the middle ground on abortion than many of their colleagues.

Only eleven tax schemes were declared in last eight years

Body


New figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that just 11 tax-avoidance schemes were notified by tax practitioners and planners in the last eight years since laws mandating them to do so were introduced.
The mandatory disclosure regime was introduced in the 2010 finance act, and requires ‘promoters’ of tax-based transactions to disclose details of them and the clients that have used them.
Seven notifications were received in 2011, one in 2012, two in 2014 and one in 2017. Four of the schemes related to employee benefit trusts, three to artificial loss schemes, two to share transactions and the final two related to assets and liabilities from a partnership to a limited company.
In some circumstances, the users of the scheme are also obliged to notify Revenue that they are using the scheme.
Elsewhere, the Revenue Commissioners is considering setting up a dedicated team to work offshore asset trawls based on massive recent inflows of international tax data.
Since 2015, Revenue has received increasing amounts of data from other jurisdictions under the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) programme, a global effort to help crack down on tax avoidance.
This data has enabled Revenue to detect Irish people with significant sources of income from overseas, such as salaries, director’s fees or income from pensions or property.
A note on the compliance approach to AEOI prepared for Revenue Commissioners chairman Niall Cody, which is partially redacted, notes that due to “the complexity of tax risks . . . and in order to ensure consistency of treatment across districts, Revenue may wish to create a specialist team - whether a dedicated unit or a small, full-time ‘virtual’ team - to work AEOI cases”.
Taxpayers who are found to have significant undeclared offshore assets can face serious penalties of up to 100 per cent of the liability if they are deemed not to have cooperated with the Revenue Commissioners.
The Revenue last year contacted almost half a million income tax payers, inviting them to make disclosures in relation to offshore matters. The initial Revenue analysis of the tax data indicated that the main risk areas for Irish taxpayers with overseas income were concentrated in those who had foreign pension income, according to the note, which finds that “there is a higher tax risk for Ireland with respect to foreign pensions when compared to foreign employment income”.

Phelan’s aesthetic clinics raise €1 million seed fund

SISU Clinic, a group of physician-led aesthetic clinics led by serial entrepreneur Pat Phelan, has raised a €1 million seed fund round from some of Ireland’s best-known technology founders.
SISU has acquired the assets of Visage Clinic, which has three outlets in Dublin, Cork and Killarney. Brothers Dr James Cotter and Dr Brian Cotter, who founded Visage, have co-founded SISU with Phelan.
Among the investors backing SISU are Liam Casey, the founder of PCH, Linda and Dan Kiely of Voxpro, Jonnie Kenny, region head of Blackhawk Network, entrepeneur Julianne McElligott and Barry O’Brien of Silicon Valley Bank.
“Our initial goal is between 30 and 100 stores across Ireland, Britain, mainland Europe and maybe an offshoot in Dubai or Moscow,” Phelan said.
Co-founder Dr James Cotter said SISU offered non-surgical aesthetic treatments that were only administered by doctors and provided with before and after care.
“As the global market for non-surgical aesthetic treatments grows, patients are becoming savvier and more demanding,” James Cotter said.
“When these treatments are done properly, people will not be able to tell whether you have had a medical treatment but they will notice you look more well rested,” he added. SISU offers a range of treatments including Botox, derma fillers, lip fillers and thread lifting.
“The most common thing when people come in is they say they are tired of looking tired. They just want to look like a fresher, less tired version of themselves and we can do that,” he added.
“The market we are in exists but is fragmented. What we want to do with SISU is create a brand that will effectively become the market. That is a big ambition but with the approach, the brand and the platform it is totally doable,” James Cotter added.
Phelan predicted that SISU could become bigger than Trustev, his online fraud fighting company, which he sold for $44 million to Transunion in 2015. Phelan continues to work for his old company one day a week with the rest of his time devoted to SISU where he is chief executive.
“I have always felt proud of the companies I have built but I have never felt that connection to a brand like SISU before,” Phelan said.
“I think this is infinitely scaleable. I think it can be three or four times the size of Trustev.
“The guys have built a large network of practitioners so I am not fighting Facebook or Google for the best engineers. We have access to the best doctors so that means we can scale quicker,” he continued.
Phelan said SISU was looking at opening a second clinic in Dublin as well as in the Galway region.
“We want to go international asap. I am already scouting locations in southeast England and northern England,” he added.
“This round of investment will supercharge our drive to add international links in SISU’s chains of next-level aesthetic beauty and patient care.”
In preparation for becoming chief executive, Phelan said he had lost five stone using strength and conditioning training - and that he had also availed of SISU’s products.
“Listen, it is fitness and weights from here down,” Phelan laughed, gesturing below his face. “But from here up, yes, I’ve used our services. My wife doesn’t know! She thinks I’m just looking better by using good face creams - but she will know now!”

Works by David O’Kane, Michael Cullen, Clare Cashman, Guggi and Veronica Dooley are among those that will be sold by the American businessman and philanthropist Tony Pilaro in a charity auction later this month.
Pilaro and his wife Linda have donated 42 pieces of work to the auction, which takes place at the RDS in Dublin on May 28. The proceeds will go towards developing the RDS Visual Art Awards.
All 42 pieces were completed by recipients of the CAP Foundation award. The Pilaros funded the award, which ran for ten years from 1998, and which each year helped two graduates of the National College of Art and Design in Dublin to make the transition from student to artist.
Pilaro, who received an honourary doctorate from UCD in 2008, has funded a number of other initiatives, including a scholarship programme for African-American students at his alma mater, the University of Virginia, and the foundation of the Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases (CRID) at UCD.
At the awarding of the honorary doctorate, Professor William Hall told guests that there was “no question that CRID would not exist today had it not been for Anthony Pilaro’s support and generosity”.
Pilaro, a tax lawyer by profession, is a close associate of Chuck Feeney, the Irish-American businessman whose Atlantic Philanthropies gave away billions to good causes before being wound down last year.

Pitch battle:Virgin expects to launch sports channel after Champions League coup

Virgin Media Ireland is expected to launch an exclusive sports channel as it continues to buy up sporting rights, a move that would intensify the battle for sports rights among Irish broadcasters. The company, which owns TV3, last week won exclusive rights to the lion’s share of Uefa Champions League and Europa League matches and the finals for the next three years.
While Virgin Media and TV3 have kept silent on their scheduling plans for the games, it is likely they will keep most of them on a free-to-air channel, said Nick Fletcher, director of media insight at Core.
“It is in TV3’s best interests to keep as much of the content free-to-air as it can,” he said. “The real game changer is that this opens the door for Virgin Media to launch a paid-for specific sports channel.”
John Trainor, founder of sports sponsorship company Onside, said Virgin Sports TV seems possible especially as TV3 and Virgin Media’s parent Liberty Global is constantly increasing its investment in sports.
Virgin Media is owned by John Malone’s Liberty Global which means TV3 could potentially use that relationship to get some of Liberty Global’s sports rights, for example, Formula One.
“TV3 would have to bid for these rights through the normal channels, but there is an existing relationship there which I am sure would help. It opens up huge doors for TV3 as a group,” Fletcher said.
Sports rights are often a loss leader. Those in the industry estimate that, in total, the Uefa Champions League and Europa League rights in Ireland were worth about €20 million between TV3 and RTE, with the greater amount paid by TV3.
It is unlikely the commercial broadcaster will make that investment back directly from the rights but Fletcher said it could provide a platform for TV3 and Virgin Media to grow their subscription base if they offer a new channel or if they offer exclusive content via the Virgin Media platform.
Trainor added that it also unlocks opportunities to sell sports programming bundles that might include a cross platform advertising pack including rugby and football – the crossover fans of both sports is close to two in three adults in Ireland according to Onside’s research.
“In terms of sponsorship revenues, as the broadcasts come already loaded with the tournament sponsors broadcast rights and stings, this income stream is restricted,” Trainor said.
“However, there are clearly lateral semi-direct income boosters. Big supporters of Champions League like Heineken and Nissan will undoubtedly see their relationship with TV3 go deeper as a result of this move.”
While many saw TV3’s win as a loss for RTÉ, Fletcher said that it might actually affect Eir Sport more than the national broadcaster.
“One of Eir’s big USPs was the fact that they have all the European football rights. They will continue to have the European football rights. They haven’t lost it because it is transmitted from Britain, but it might be easier for subscribers to get a Virgin Media package instead of an Eir Sport package,” Fletcher said.
“There is no question that it will put pressure on some of the subscribers to Eir Sports who just subscribe because of the European football.”
In fact, Trainor said that RTE acted shrewdly as it protected its medium term power play in football by securing exclusive free-to-air broadcast rights to Ireland’s competitive European qualifiers for Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup and, in a separate agreement, securing exclusive free-to-air broadcast rights in this country for the finals of Euro 2020.
RTÉ already holds rights to the European qualifiers and finals for this summer’s World Cup in Russia and the broadcast rights to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But with the Six Nations and the Uefa rights in its back pocket, there are many questions about what sports rights TV3 might go after next.
RTE’s heritage and back catalogue of GAA coverage is “a major strength in its armoury”, but the ever-changing media landscape means anyone could bid for GAA rights, according to Trainor.
As TV3 builds its expertise with coverage of world-class events like the Champions League and Six Nations, he said it will also increase its capability to raise the bar on GAA coverage. It is also likely that TV3 will try to win the biggest football rights of all: the 2026 World Cup.
“By then, anything is possible,” Trainor said.

Place your bets on Paddy Power’s ability to clear minor hurdles
Sunday Business Post

Length: 1144 words
Byline: Michael Murray
Highlight: Even with the ever-present spectre of regulatory interjection, the Irish-bred bookmaker has built a resilient tech-led business that’s worth a punt 
Body


Paddy Power Betfair’s last trading update six weeks ago was a disappointment, with revenues flat and operating profits down 9 per cent. But it is in the nature of a gambling company’s business to have unpredictable setbacks, rarely linked to macroeconomic issues but rather to other more specific events. In this instance the contributor to the poor performance in ‘wintery’ quarter one was the cancellation of racing fixtures – usually caused by hostile weather conditions and beyond the gambling company’s control.
But despite setbacks along the way and inevitably unpredictable results outcomes, few would dispute the success of the betting business over the long term.
I have not been a shareholder in Paddy Power for a decade or more. I recall originally buying shares in the company for around £5; last week they were £80 and the largest riser in the Ftse 100. Over the long term – two decades at least – shareholders have done spectacularly well out of the company if they have been patient.
Once a minnow, Paddy Power has a current stockmarket value almost four times that of the once-leading British bookmaker Ladbrokes, even after the latter’s merger with Coral. It is listed on the Ftse 100 with a market capitalisation of £7 billion, compared to £2.7 billion for William Hill, and is almost as far ahead of Ladbrokes Coral, neither of the latter two are now in the top indices.
Only a begrudger would doubt the ability of Paddy Power and its management team and the spectacular success they have achieved over the past two decades. Strategy, branding, diversification, and operational excellence have all contributed.
So, too, has the management’s ability to acquire judiciously, and integrate well. Undoubtedly one of Paddy Power’s great sources of competitive advantage has been the quality of its technology and its ability to leverage it to maximise operating efficiencies and (through data mining) to maximise sales opportunities.
Regulation has been, and will continue to be, a threat to the industry because of the perceived financial and social damage that any business in the gambling market can do to society and its customers, but we can say the same about tobacco and alcohol companies.
For them, as for Paddy Power, when one door closes through regulation another opens (e-cigarettes and emerging markets in the case of tobacco). In Paddy Power’s case, when sports betting was banned in many parts of the US, it developed fantasy sports in order to retain and grow its share of the sports gamblers’ wallet. It certainly worked.
Paddy’s first flush of success had its origins in its steadily improving brand position within the Irish market and the extension of betting beyond the racecourse, into politics and entertainment.
That success carried over into Britain, the US and Australia, where a big Irish ethnic segment of immigrants reside who clearly identify with the Paddy brand.
Brand development aside, the creation of first-class technological capability – with the recruitment of some of the best young graduates to whom the casually dressed environment in Paddy Power headquarters appeals – has been another pillar propping up the company, facilitating the company’s mastery of advanced analytics for effective customer segmentation and marketing. A series of strategically well-chosen acquisitions has been the third pillar of the group’s success.
Over the past two decades Paddy Power has grown at a pace unrivalled by any of its British competitors, with significant inroads made into the US and Australian markets. What is key is that the group can continue to leverage its technological capabilities at little additional unit cost per sale.
Technological capability is now probably its most important source of competitive advantage. This has not only facilitated the development of a significantly wider market than its bookies shops would have conferred, but the development of a formidable marketing tool.
These are particularly important from an investor’s perspective because of the potential they give the company to target specific audiences effectively and to minimise incremental costs as volumes rise.
That’s why I am optimistic about the recent news, specifically the loosening of regulations in the US on sports betting
It is impossible to speculate on the likely value to Paddy Power of this move. We must remember that when bans on sports betting were introduced in many US states, Paddy Power’s introduction of fantasy sport betting more than cushioned the blow for them. That said, the lifting of the ban is a positive, and the market has seen it as such with the leap in the share price following the announcement.
Given the low marginal cost of increased volume from on-line sports betting, the impact for Paddy Power and its competitors should be very worthwhile.
Regulation will always present risks for betting companies.
However, the sensitivity of it in most of the markets in which Paddy Power operates and the influence (and tax take) from betting activity that politicians love is likely to ensure that further regulatory intrusion will not be quick.
The question therefore is: after the run-up in the share price over the past week, is this the time to jump in? The quality of Paddy Power’s management, the strength of its brand, the power of its technology and the ability to leverage that power at a very low incremental unit cost has made it tempting for me as an investment even at last week’s elevated price. As the news broke last Thursday, however, of the curtailment of betting stakes through slot machines in the shops – while probably good from a societal point of view – I hesitated buying for fear that it may restrain Paddy’s gallop in the weeks ahead.
However, I will be keeping a close eye on this mooted regulatory development – and on innovations that may thwart its impact, as the fantasy games did – thus keeping Paddy at the top of the leader board in the gambling industry.
In the meantime, the company has plenty of financial flexibility with low leverage, good dividend cover, plenty of capacity to expand and innovate, and a technological capability that looks certain to keep customers engaged. It remains a quality business and the market leader now on these islands with more than a good strategic foothold in the US and Australia.
I don’t expect Paddy to be knocked off that perch and certainly, if I choose to bet on the gambling sector, it will be Paddy I will place my money on.
The current price to earnings ratio in its mid-to high 20s may not adequately reflect the discount that might get cooked in following the most recent news reducing maximum slot machine bet sizes, although there appeared to be little immediate negative impact on the price late last week.
In the coming days I am hoping for some pullback on last week’s elevated share price, whereupon I will certainly place a bet!

Poll analysis points to a narrow Yes victory

Length: 887 words
Byline: Richard Colwell
Highlight: Taking into account the fact that the majority of undecided voters are likely to vote No in the upcoming referendum, but may be unwilling to say so, we asked voters what they thought the outcome would be. The result: a narrow 56 per cent vote for Yes 
Body


The difficulties in predicting many referendums over the last number of years has led Red C to investigate different ways to predict the outcome. The problems with predicting a referendum are twofold.
First, the subject in question is often contentious and divides the population, meaning people are less likely to want to share their views. The idea of ‘shy’ voters has been long examined in election campaigns, by a number of academics and pollsters. The theory is that sometimes a position or party becomes so against the general views of the media and society that people become embarrassed to express the view that they support the said party or position.
In this campaign the No side have not been as strongly represented in the media, with little political party support on the side of the No camp, and the media firmly in the Yes camp. So it wouldn’t be a surprise if voters were shy about telling us they plan to vote No. This is why, in our view, it is safer to assume that those claiming to be undecided are more likely to vote No.
Secondly, there is the issue of the ‘status quo’ effect. A large part of the population is often not as interested in referendums as we may imagine, and often don’t really understand the reasons behind any change to the constitution. When you don’t fully understand why change is suggested, and don’t feel the need to engage with an issue, why would you change the constitution? It is far easier to leave the constitution as it is. This ‘status quo’ effect has been registered in many Irish referendums of the past. The main impact on any polling analysis is that a much larger proportion of undecided voters tend to end up voting No than might be expected. Voting No keeps the status quo of the current situation and removes any danger from a change that could impact on you personally.
These two factors make correctly predicting a referendum through standard claimed recall very difficult, particularly when 20 per cent of the population remain undecided or won’t tell you how they will vote.
One of the tools we use to try and uncover shy undecided voters is called the ‘wisdom of crowds’. As well as asking how our representative sample of voters claim they will vote themselves, we also asked them to predict what they thought the final result might be. This aims to take into account the conversations that voters are having with family and friends about the topic, and how they see people voting on election day. It means we collect information on what proportion of their friends and family are saying to each other they will vote No, even if they won’t tell us directly.
The wisdom of crowds approach works best when families and friends are talking about a topic in detail, because that means our crowd is very well informed about how their friends and family might vote. So it worked very well in predicting the marriage equality referendum result, with 100 per cent accuracy. But not so well at the last general election, when it appears that few people had worthwhile discussions with each other about how they might vote. Based on the level of conversations people are likely to have had already in the run up to the abortion referendum, the approach should also work well in this referendum.
When we ask people in our final pre-election poll how they will vote, 56 per cent say they will vote Yes, quite a lot higher than seen in other face-to-face polls. While 27 per cent say they will vote No, 14 per cent say they remain undecided and 3 per cent refuse to tell us how they will vote. Compared to the last poll it appears that those undecided voters making up their minds in the past month are distributing to the same proportion as those who were already decided.
If you were simply to remove the undecided voters and assume they will vote the same as those that tell us, you would end up with 67 per cent Yes vs 33 per cent No. However, we know from previous referendums that just reallocating the undecided voters in this way simply isn’t an accurate way of doing things. The undecided voters that are left are far more likely to vote No due to the status quo and shy voter effects, and our analysis of their underlying attitudes to abortion suggests this will be the case again. In fact, our analysis suggests that 80-90 per cent of undecided voters that go and vote, could vote No on the day.
We therefore look to our wisdom of crowds analysis to help us understand the real dynamic behind claimed voter intention. The crowd predictions suggest a Yes vote of 56 per cent and a No vote of 44 per cent . This is potentially a much closer result than suggested by the claimed vote intention, with a 11 per cent swing from yes to No. That tells us that, despite our target suggesting they will vote Yes in greater numbers, they are very conscious that many of their friends and family will vote No. It gives further credence to our decision to allocate at least 80-90 per cent of the undecided voters to the No camp.
Overall then we expect the Yes vote to be in and around 56 per cent to 58 per cent at this stage and, barring any major interventions in the campaign over the next week, that is the most likely result. Still enough for the Yes camp to win the referendum, but closer than top line vote intentions suggest.

Profile Jürgen Klopp: The romance of the Klopp

Highlight: Hugh O'Connell profiles the Liverpool manager ahead of his Champions League final against Spanish giants Real Madrid this Saturday.
Body


Factfile
Age: 50
Appearance: tall, bespectacled, unshaven and unmistakably German
Newsworthiness: he leads Liverpool into the Champions League final against Spanish giants Real Madrid this Saturday.
On the day he became Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp told the club’s expectant supporters: “We have to change from doubters to believers.” It wasn’t just the fans that had to change, it was the whole mentality of the club too. At Liverpool’s Melwood training ground, at the manager’s behest, the walls around its indoor artificial training pitch now carry images celebrating the club’s former glories as a way of inspiring the current crop of players to reach those heady heights.
For nearly three decades, a succession of managers and players have felt the heavy burden of those former glories. Liverpool have not been able to match the sustained success of the 1970s and 1980s, when they won the league so often some fans got bored of it. Instead, there have been only fleeting moments of success like the miraculous 2005 Champions League win in Istanbul, followed by dramatic declines. Eight years ago, the club nearly went into administration after a disastrous takeover by two US businessmen.
But under another set of American owners, Fenway Sports Group, these are better days for Liverpool supporters (full disclosure: this writer is one of them). Klopp has got the doubters believing again. Last weekend, Liverpool secured a second consecutive season of Champions League football for 2018-19. But, far more importantly, the club stands on the brink of winning that competition outright after a series of stunning displays against Porto, Roma and Manchester City.
This Saturday, tens of thousands of Liverpool fans will descend on the Ukrainian capital Kiev, believing that Klopp’s stylish brand of relentless attacking football, led by the goalscoring exploits of Egyptian striker Mo Salah, can defeat Spanish giants Real Madrid and deliver a sixth European Cup win.
In the affluent Liverpool suburb of Formby, the has-beens and could’ve-beens who make up the teams competing in Sunday football leagues are sometimes surprised to see an instantly recognisable face on the sparsely populated touchline. Local resident Klopp has been spotted more than once stopping to watch whatever mediocre football match is taking place.
“He thinks about football all the time, he watches football all the time, he talks about football all the time,” said German football writer Raphael Honigstein. “He is a genuine football obsessive.”
Born in Stuttgart, Klopp grew up in the sleepy Black Forest village of Glatten along with two older sisters. By his own admission he was an average footballer, starting out as a striker before ending his career as a defender. For almost all of his professional career he was at lowly Mainz, where he played nearly 400 games, scoring 52 goals. In his own words: “I never succeeded in bringing to the field what was going on in my brain.”
Klopp was more suited to being a student of the game. In his book Klopp: Bring the Noise, Honigstein writes about how Klopp was inspired by Wolfgang Frank, his former manager at Mainz. Frank championed the concept of defending narrowly in certain areas of the pitch by flooding it with players in order to pressure the opposition into losing the ball.
This was the genesis of a footballing style Klopp has pioneered: ‘gegenpressing’. It’s a tactical concept which involves a team, upon losing the ball, immediately attempting to win it back by hounding the individual who has possession rather than falling back to regroup as many others do. It is built on the principle that an opposition player is at their most vulnerable immediately after they have won the ball.
It sounds like common sense, but its successful application is dependent on your team having enormous fitness levels, being able to apply pressure at the right times and in the right areas of the pitch. “This is someone who has had this epiphany as a player that a system and an idea can bridge the gap between a good team and a bad team,” Honigstein told The Sunday Business Post.
Such tactical nuances - discussed endlessly by football fans and pundits on internet forums, blogs, Twitter, radio phone-ins and so on - jar somewhat with the widespread perception of Klopp as the chest-thumping motivator. He manically prowls the touchline during each game, celebrating every goal wildly, and delivers entertaining and insightful post-match interviews.
But there is another side to him. For a start, he is not always in a great mood when he has to fulfil his contractual obligation to do dozens of interviews pre- and post-match. He is prone to lashing out at journalists. In one particularly spiky exchange last year, he sarcastically laughed at an interviewer and told him: “I only want to talk to people who have a little bit of understanding of football.”
Within coaching circles there is some scepticism about Klopp, some seeing him as more of a motivator than a details man. “They feel he’s maybe not quite precise enough,” football writer Jonathan Wilson told The Football Republic. “Clearly motivation is a huge part of what he does, but I think there is a sense - and I’m not saying I agree with it - that he’s not quite as sophisticated as a Guardiola, as a Mourinho.”
It’s not a view shared by Honigstein, who said Klopp and his backroom team put enormous preparation into each game. “Motivation is part of that because you can’t get them to play in a high energy style unless they believe in that,” he said.
“But the other part is a gameplan. It might not always come off, but there is a really detailed gameplan going on all the time. He finds it almost a little bit showy to talk about that side of stuff.”
Before Liverpool, Klopp managed Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in his homeland. His track record at those clubs was one extraordinary success before things went awry in the final few years at both clubs. He became Mainz manager in 2001, the same year he retired from playing, and within three seasons had led them to their first promotion to the top-flight in four decades. But three seasons later they were back in the second division.
Klopp departed for Dortmund where he was tasked with waking a sleeping giant of German football. For years, Die Schwarzgelben (the Black and Yellows) lived in the shadows of their richer and more successful rivals Bayern Munich, but Klopp delivered two consecutive Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, he led them to the Champions League final at Wembley, where they were beaten by Bayern in the last minute.
But Klopp’s record in finals is a worrying one for Liverpool fans. He’s lost his last five, including two in his first season at Anfield.
Despite Dortmund declining in his final two years there, Klopp was hot property in managerial circles. There were offers from Manchester United, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. But for Klopp, it had to be Liverpool, a club rich in history and folklore that supporters revel in (and that others dismiss as maudlin sentimentality). When he joined, he confided to club insiders that Liverpool were the team he wanted to manage above all others, because it was one that needed change and, more importantly, could be changed.
At Melwood, he has transformed the staff and player canteen from what was considered a dull, lifeless environment into a hub that is often full with people from different club departments. Players mix freely with back office staff and Klopp is in among them too. He takes a great interest in all aspects of the club, buzzing off the fact that Liverpool’s official website is the most visited club site in Europe. Before his first Merseyside derby against Everton, he was quizzing club staff who are from Liverpool about what the game meant to the city.
“He gets it,” Gareth Roberts from The Anfield Wrap podcast said. “From day one he has embraced what he has walked into and attempted to harness the power of the fans and of Anfield. That he wants supporters to play an active part has been recognised and appreciated by those paying big money to watch this team home and away.”
Klopp also recently waded in on the Brexit debate, raising eyebrows by calling for a second referendum. “Let’s think about it again and let’s vote again with the right information - not with the information you’ve got around the Brexit campaign. They were obviously not right, not all of them. It makes no sense at all,” he told the Guardian in April.
The intervention was a long time coming, according to Honigstein, whose book documents Klopp’s left-wing political views. “He has been biting his tongue for quite a while and looking for a way to talk about this. He does see this as a big mistake, as a folly - as most UK-based Europeans would do. He wanted to get it off his chest. It’s a genuine reflection of his beliefs and he is the kind of guy that will talk about it.”
On the pitch, Klopp has adapted his tactics to suit the English game with the relentless pressing game giving way to a more measured approach in comparison to his time at Dortmund, according to Honigstein. “He is trying to maximise opportunities. When you have three forwards you don’t want to run them into the ground,” he said, a reference to the attacking triumvirate of Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané and Mo Salah who have scored 90 goals between them this season.
Salah’s remarkable transformation from creative winger to devastating goalscorer has seen records smashed and individual awards a plenty. Klopp’s man-management is party responsible for this, according to Roberts: “Klopp has undoubtedly been key to his positioning, his play, and his link-up with team-mates.”
Klopp has also been able to re-energise the careers of several Liverpool players who had had indifferent Anfield careers before he arrived. Club vice-captain James Milner is playing the best football of his career, breaking the Champions League record for assists on Liverpool’s run to the final. Klopp has also nurtured precocious talents like teenage full back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was named in the England World Cup squad last week. “For Liverpool it was hugely attractive because they weren’t in a situation to spend loads of money on the squad, but wanted somebody who was prepared to maximise the natural resources as it were and then look to strengthen,” Honigstein said.
This owes partly to Klopp’s loyalty and perseverance with certain players although this has had drawbacks, with many fans feeling he has given too many chances to error-prone defenders Dejan Lovren and Alberto Moreno and, until recently, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. “You can perhaps level the accusation that he sometimes has too much faith in individuals and their ability to improve,” Roberts said.
His volcanic temper has not always served him well. There are numerous YouTube compilations of him angrily confronting players, referees and in one instance, kicking an ad hoarding.
He is said to have mellowed in recent years, but there has been much discussion in football circles about the recent mysterious departure of his assistant Željko Buvač with whom he worked closely with for nearly two decades. “They have had numerous loud, aggressive disagreements, real shouting matches, but always found a way to come together again,” Honigstein said of the pair’s sometimes tempestuous relationship.
It’s unclear if Buvač’s temporary leave of absence will become permanent. Klopp has invited a number of his old friends from his Mainz days to Kiev next weekend. It will be the biggest game of his managerial career to date, but it’s unclear if Buvac will be there too.
Thousands of Liverpool fans will be there, however. They are no longer doubters, and believe Klopp can bring back the glory days.

PTSB in plan to sell off 2,000 properties

Highlight: Homes voluntarily surrendered to bank in return for debt deals 
Body


Permanent TSB has taken possession of 2,000 homes from customers who fell deep into arrears on their loans.
The bank announced last year that it would write off residual debt for buy-to-let borrowers who handed back their keys to their property in an effort to cleans its balance sheet of long-term arrears.
The voluntary surrender scheme has resulted in 1,500 homes being handed back to PTSB.
The bank intends to sell these homes on the market with the tenants in place as it steps up its plans to reduce its overall level of bad debts.
It is under pressure from regulators to cut its non-performing loan levels from about a quarter of its loan book to single digits over the next year.
Last week, PTSB scaled back the size of the portfolio of loans it is selling from €3.7 billion to €2.2 billion, removing more than 6,000 loans from the sale.
Included in this figure are 4,300 so-called split mortgages, which are likely to be securitised.
The remaining loans are likely to be restructured and voluntary surrender will form part of how it works through the arrears problem. The bank has already restructured 14,000 mortgages.
The bank has faced opposition from political parties and debt advocates to the sale of Project Glas, with Fianna Fail tabling a private members’ bill to regulate vulture funds, who are the most likely buyers of the loans.
PTSB’s chief executive, Jeremy Masding, said last week that the bank must complete the sale of Project Glas despite the opposition to it.
“We can’t contribute to the real growth of the Irish economy with a 26 per cent non-performing loan ratio. You can’t decouple [a] 26 NPL ratio with mortgage pricing in Ireland,” Masding said after the bank’s annual general meeting.
The bank has had significant interest in the portfolio, and some analysts were disappointed that it reduced the size of it given the level of demand from investors to acquire Irish loan assets.
Masding said that the deal is likely to be completed later this year.
In addition to Project Glas, a number of other loan portfolios are currently up for sale, with Ulster Bank offloading more than 6,000 primary homes and buy-to-let properties with a face value of €1.6 billion.

Highlight: In order for Permanent TSB to have any future, it must offload Project Glas - and soon 
Body


Robert Elliott is not a banker. As he told shareholders of Permanent TSB last Wednesday morning, his background is in the legal profession.
His considerable legal skills, honed over many years, were on display as he held the podium for more than two hours, answering questions that had very little to do with the performance of the bank and a lot to do with individual customer complaints.
It was an assured performance for his first agm as chairman.
Elliott did, however, during the meeting, explain the bank’s dilemma when it came to dealing with bad loans.
As difficult as the decision to sell off home loans is, Elliott said Permanent TSB needed to clean up its balance sheet from the last financial crisis so that it could help the “next generation of customers to achieve their ambitions of buying their own homes”.
There’s also the not-so-small matter of regulators in Dublin and Frankfurt leaning heavily on the bank to slash its level of non-performing loans as a percentage of its overall loan book from 26 per cent to the European average of 5 per cent.
It’s a huge ask for the bank, and the most unenviable of tasks for any board. Hence the decision last February to create Project Glas, a portfolio of 14,000 loans linked to family homes and a further 4,000 buy-to-let mortgages, with a face value of €3.7 billion. Selling the book will transform PTSB’s non-performing loan levels and deliver some confidence to its investors that the bank is becoming normal once again.
But since that announcement, Permanent TSB has been under siege to reverse the decision.
Fianna Fáil has proposed a bill giving the Central Bank extra powers to regulate investment funds that acquire loan books (even though the bank is comfortable with the existing safeguards in place).
The sale of Project Glas has not had the desired effect on PTSB’s share price.
Instead of rising at the prospect of the bank clearing out its balance sheet and being focused on new lending, the share price has been steadily declining. That suggests investors are either not confident the sale will happen at all, or believe that the price the bank eventually achieves for the portfolio will be greatly lowered to reflect any conditions attached to the sale.
Those investors who bet that something would prevent the bank executing Project Glas have proven correct. Last week, the bank pulled 4,300 so-called split mortgages (where part of the loan is warehoused for a number of years) from the portfolio, as well as several thousands of other loans. In total Project Glas now contains the 4,000 buy-to-lets and about 7,200 family home loans.
Speaking to the media after the agm, the bank said it could do a transaction to take some of these loans off its balance sheet – effectively it would package them up and securitise the book with investors. But the bank would still have day-to-day management of the loans. The remaining mortgages it now intends to keep will undergo restructuring.
Jeremy Masding, the bank’s chief executive, told me the decision was taken by the board independently and there was no leaning on the bank by government. However, instead of getting kudos for the move, the bank has got it in the neck from all sides.
The political heat is still there, however. Not long after PTSB’s news, Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman Michael McGrath tweeted: “These 4,300 split mortgages should never have been included in PTSB’s Project Glas.
“Their removal is to be welcomed. Meanwhile three more ‘vulture funds’ refuse to come before the Oireachtas finance committee, yet our Central Bank doesn’t want to regulate them.”
It has also disappointed investors. A number of analysts, while recognising the political imperative for the bank to cool the tensions down, believe it would end up ultimately damaging itself.
The likely buyers, vulture funds, want chunky portfolios. And if the size of the sale can change once, can it change again? Certainty, above all else, is what is craved by buyers.
The bank insisted last week that it has had plenty of interest in Project Glas. The number of parties signing non-disclosure agreements to get access to data on the loans is into double-digit figures right now, and the bank is working towards closing the transaction later this year.
As Elliott pointed out in his opening remarks to the agm, PTSB has been extraordinarily generous to borrowers in arrears, but it has to clean up the legacy mess of the last banking crisis.
Permanent TSB cannot afford to row back now on this sale. It has to happen for the bank to have any future.

Public bodies have ignored a shortlist of public relations companies approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when hiring for new contracts.
Only one competition has run under the framework for government public relations contracts developed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), an office within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, last year. The framework agreement for the provision of public relations/communications services has been available for public bodies since October 2017.
More than 40 competitions involving public relations services, public relations management services and public relations consultancy services have been put out to tender since October, according to the Etenders website, the government’s electronic tendering platform.
The department said it did not hold information on tenders that may have taken place outside of the framework.
In a statement, the department said: “Updated user documentation for the framework was published on the OGP website last month and further advice about the framework has circulated to procurement officers recently. It is hoped that this will lead to increased usage of these arrangements by public sector bodies.”
Several of Ireland’s largest public relations companies including Edelman, DHR, Fleishman Hillard, Elevate, The Communications Clinic, Q4PR and Unique Media were not shortlisted for the framework, and thus should be excluded from tendering for government contracts worth more than €25,000.

Sabongi plans rollout of concept seafood chain ‘Crazy’ rents in capital offer ‘no business value’

Dublin restaurateur Niall Sabongi plans to open the first in a chain of small fishmongers and seafood cafés in the capital next February. Sabongi said the idea behind the Urban Monger was to appeal to shoppers who wanted to take fish home, as well as those who wanted it cooked in front of them.
The owner of Klaw, Klaw Poké and the Seafood Café had originally planned to open the first Urban Monger in a premises on South Great George’s Street which would have also included a large restaurant, a cookery school and a roof garden.
But he pulled out of the project after realising it would take up a disproportionate amount of his time.
“I didn’t want to get to the point where I didn’t have time to do any cooking myself,” he said. “I’ll focus on the existing businesses this year, then roll out the Urban Monger next year. My plan is to have five or six small units spread out around the city.”
In an interview with today’s Sunday Business Post Magazine, Sabongi and Gaz Smith of Michael’s restaurant in Mount Merrion – both of whom have championed the use of Irish fish and seafood – raise concerns about the increasing cost of operating restaurants in the capital.
Smith, whose restaurant won four categories at last week’s Restaurant Association of Ireland (RAI) annual awards, said he had turned down the offer of two premises over the past six months.
“There is no value in Dublin any more. It’s all gone crazy again in terms of rents and key money,” he said. “This is a family business, and it doesn’t make sense to us to pay out huge money for another premises in a city that is being flooded with new restaurants. Our plan is to sit back for 18 months or so and reassess things then.”

Screen test

Highlight: The cancer screening controversy has parallels with a crisis that rocked the British NHS 17 years ago – but it is being handled very differently 
Body


In 2001, Britain’s health service was rocked by a crisis in its screening programme for cervical cancer. It came under intense public, media and political scrutiny.
That episode had many parallels with the omnishambles that is now engulfing the cervical screening programme in Ireland, but the way it was handled was very different.
Leicester Royal Infirmary, a large hospital in England, carried out an audit, and reviewed the smear history, of 403 women who developed invasive cervical cancer between 1993 and 2000.
It was a retrospective audit similar to the one carried out by CervicalCheck, which has generated extensive controversy and criticism.
The Leicester audit found that 324 of the women concerned – or 80 per cent – had a cervical smear before diagnosis and their test results were re-examined.
In the cases of 84 women, a false negative report (a test result which wrongly indicates that a particular condition or attribute is absent) had been issued; in 38 women, the cytological abnormality had been undergraded.
The consequences of these misinterpretations were serious and, in some cases, fatal.
Twenty of these 122 women died, diagnostic delay being an important factor in 14 deaths. The same diagnostic delay led to 64 women having more radical treatment than would have been otherwise required.
[caption id="attachment_416976" align="alignleft" width="226"] Vicky Phelan’s legal action brought the cervical cancer screening scandal to light[/caption]
In 2003, the British Journal of Gynaecology described how there had been an “internal debate” among top managers and clinicians about how to handle the sensitive information.
“Eventually, advice was sought from the Department of Health. A decision was made at ministerial level to release these data at a press conference and to tell the women or their bereaved relatives the results of individual reviews of previous cytological examinations,” the medical journal reported.
In Ireland, the communications strategy for relaying the audit results to women was slow, cavalier and substandard. Many women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer were not told that the health service had initiated an audit into their screening history (after their cervical cancer diagnosis).
When the review discovered 209 false negative test results, most of these women (80 per cent) were not told.
The only reason why many women, and families of deceased women, learned about their screening history was because Vicky Phelan took a legal action and refused to sign a confidentiality clause. Phelan has been told that her cancer is terminal, and was recently awarded a €2.5 million settlement from the US lab that failed to detect abnormalities in her smear test.
We know that 19 women (out of the 209) have died, although it has yet to be confirmed that all of those deaths were from cervical cancer. We do not know how many of the rest now have terminal cancer, nor do we know the number who have been successfully treated.
While the failure to tell women affected did not have a material effect on their care (the reviews/audits were initiated after they were diagnosed with cervical cancer), they were denied important information.
It is hard to put it more succinctly than Phelan herself. “As women, we have the right to know information about own bodies and our own care,” she said last week.
The communications process between the two jurisdictions was markedly different, but the understandable public anxiety and financial liability were similar.
Speaking at that press conference in Leicester back in 2001, the British government’s cancer czar, Mike Richards, said it was tragic that women had died and offered his condolences to bereaved relatives.
He stressed that Leicester Royal Infirmary was not failing, stating that “no screening test can ever be 100 per cent accurate. It is not an exact science. That is why the audit was undertaken in the first place, to learn and then improve the service. Leicester is not failing, it performs well on all qualitative assurance measures and death rates from cervical cancer are falling in line with national trends”.
Newspaper headlines in England featured the words ‘blunder’, ‘scandal’ and ‘devastating’. The British audit drew the fallibility of cervical smear tests to the public’s attention.
The hospital advised women and their relatives that they might choose to seek legal advice, and identified a firm of solicitors who could offer such advice. This move caused serious concern among medical groups.
“This linkage of the results of a medical audit to medico-legal liability is fraught with difficulty. A message that perfection is the only acceptable standard and anything less should be compensated changes the professional compact between employer and clinician. A false negative smear is not necessarily evidence of negligence,” the medical journal warned.
Some years previously, the Department of Health in Britain had lost an important case in the court of appeal over three women who had developed cervical cancer in spite of regular smear tests.
The appeal was brought by the East Kent health authority, which has already settled more than 50 negligence claims following a cervical smear scandal at the Kent and Canterbury hospital which came to light in 1996. The three women had to have hysterectomies after they were found to be suffering from advanced cervical cancer.
They had adenocarcinomas – an aggressive sort of cervical cancer more difficult to detect through screening.
The health authority argued that their cancers were particularly difficult to spot and could not have been picked up by the screening process.
[caption id="attachment_416978" align="alignright" width="187"] Tony Holohan, chief medical officer at the Dept of Health[/caption]
East Kent’s action was backed by the NHS screening programme and the Department of Health, which were alarmed at the possible implications of the earlier verdict that the screeners should have spotted the pre-cancerous cells.
Julietta Patnick, head of the screening programme, warned that if the judge’s ruling went unchallenged, the NHS would have to raise its standards to the point where virtually every abnormality would be picked up, or face a compensation claim. Patnick said this would mean women being recalled for unnecessary investigations.
The British Medical Journal covered the story extensively and raised serious concerns about the legal decision.
“Did the judge really understand how reliably or unreliably the smear test ‘performs’ in day to day conditions? Did he realise that any time 90,000 slides are reviewed, several hundred will be reallocated to a new category? Was he familiar with the relevant medical literature? Did he know that borderlines and inadequates are not included in the sets of slides used in UK Quality Assurance because they cannot be agreed upon?” the publication asked.
“In many published studies of smear test reproducibility, inter-observer agreement even for experts is rarely better than 80 per cent, and poorer for milder abnormalities. Consent forms and disclaimers in the US say that 5 to 15 per cent of abnormal slides maybe deemed normal. Could the judge have given due weight to the concept of non-negligent false negative tests?”
Irene Regan, vice-president of the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science, said further details about each of the 209 cases as well as “error rates” from the laboratories would be hugely important when determining the diagnostic accuracy of the labs used by CervicalCheck.
If the cases were distributed across all laboratories, it could be seen as a limitation of the cytology test. However, if the false negatives were concentrated in one laboratory, then this required further investigation, she said.
Regan noted the fact that the HSE had not provided data showing the negative predictive value of tests.
Negative predictive value is the probability that subjects with a negative screening truly do not have the disease, while positive predictive value is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease.
“We have only seen data for the positive predictive value [at the labs being used],” Regan said. “There will be some [precancers] that should have been picked up if present on a cytology slide [although there is an acceptable error rate]. In general, higher grade precancers should be picked up. We don’t know how many of those there were.”
Many doctors are concerned at the potential financial liability that will arise for CervicalCheck – and its future implications for healthcare and screening.
The Pap test, or cervical smear, involves subjective interpretation of thousands of cells that are present in each sample. The process is subjective, but subjectivity is reduced when two independent qualified expert scientists examine the slide.
Various studies and organisations – including the American Society of Cytopathology (ASC) – state that experience indicates an irreducible false-negative rate of around 5 per cent.
“Although rescreening can reduce the false-negative rate, zero-error performance cannot currently be attained. Many factors, including the subjectivity involved in interpreting difficult cases and sampling problems with specimen collection, prevent zero-error performance,” states the ASC.
“The finding of a false-negative sample is not necessarily evidence of practice below the standard of care.
“The decision as to whether a false-negative GYN cytology sample is the result of negligence should be made not only on the basis of evaluation of a single sample but should also include an evaluation of patient’s past clinical history and previous GYN cytology results. The test results should also be viewed in the context of the accredited laboratory’s overall performance on GYN cytology samples.”
A leading cancer specialist said: “We need to know if our preventable false negatives are more common than those reported by other leading countries. Even if they are not, underwriting a policy of routine redress for screening failure could be more expensive than the screening programmes themselves.”
The specialist said that international studies suggest there will be 50 false negatives or interval cancers for every 100,000 cervical smear tests that are read. CervicalCheck does about 300,000 smears a year.
The cancer specialist said this meant that there will be about 150 false negatives each year. “We know that about half of these will be deemed avoidable – with about two thirds being minor mistakes and one third being bad mistakes.”
That means 75 women could seek financial redress each year.

Donal Brennan, a professor of gynaecological oncology and consultant obstetrician, said he was concerned about the potential impact of the CervicalCheck crisis on screening and quality assurance.
Brennan said false negatives only came to light because of an audit process, which exists to improve the system.
He said the fallout could “stop a lot of quality assurance and audit in future. In the long-term that could lead to standards falling.”
Brennan said the potential damage was not just limited to screening, but also other parts of the health service such as radiology.
“The international [medical] community is watching what is going on here and is really concerned. They worry this could bring a halt to screening,” he said. “We need to put a lot of thought into the redress process.”
The legal position is likely to differ from that of healthcare providers.

Six ministers are among nearly a quarter of the Fine Gael parliamentary party who have declined to declare a position on the Eighth Amendment ahead of Friday’s referendum.
Cabinet minister Michael Ring and junior ministers Catherine Byrne, Damien English, David Stanton, Pat Breen and Paul Kehoe have not declared publicly whether they are advocating a Yes or No vote in the referendum.
They are among 19 Fine Gael TDs and senators who have not said publicly what their position is. The undeclared stance of this many Fine Gael parliamentarians is in contrast to the vast majority of Fianna Fáil TDs and senators who have indicated their stance.
Both parties have a free vote on the issue although many of their TDs and senators, even those who have declared their position, are not actively canvassing during the referendum campaign.
In total, The Sunday Business Post has established that 42 out of the 70-strong Fine Gael parliamentary party are advocating a Yes vote, while nine are calling for a No vote.
Contacted by this newspaper in recent weeks, a number of Fine Gael TDs who have not declared publicly said they would be voting Yes. These include Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, party chairman Martin Heydon, and junior finance minister Michael D’Arcy. D’Arcy is understood to have told a Fine Gael AGM in Wexford that he was voting Yes last Monday night.
A spokesman for Creed said: “Minister Creed is advocating for a Yes vote on May 25 and has been campaigning accordingly.
The minister has expressed concerns regarding the 12-week proposal.
However, he is focused on ensuring that the referendum is passed.”
A spokesman for Minister for Rural Affairs Michael Ring said “no comment” when asked if the minister was for or against repeal of the Eighth Amendment.
A spokeswoman for the Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said she is not campaigning on the issue, but is advocating for a Yes vote.
“This is a sensitive and personal issue and the minister is urging people to arm themselves with the facts,” she said.
Seven Fine Gael TDs and six senators did not respond when contacted by phone, email and text about their position on the referendum.
The seven TDs include former taoiseach Enda Kenny, former ministers Michael Noonan and Dara Murphy, as well as backbenchers Joe Carey, John Deasy, Pat Deering and Peter Burke. The six senators include Frank Feighan, Kieran O’Donnell, Maria Byrne, Michelle Mulherin, Paddy Burke and former minister Paudie Coffey.
Recently-elected senator Tony Lawlor said he would be voting Yes and pointed to his support for the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act five years ago.

Smurfit’s GAN under starters’ orders

Length: 1068 words

Highlight: Dermot Smurfit jr’s GAN  looks set to strike gold, now that the US Supreme Court has given betting the green light 
Body


‘Let’s just rehash, will we?” Dermot Smurfit jr, chief executive of GAN, formerly Game Account Network, has seen some twists and turns in the last five years.
He got another one last week after – of all things – a US Supreme Court ruling, but first he wants to give a summary of the journey.
GAN’s journey goes back a while. The company was founded in 2002, as Game Account Network, heavily backed by Smurfit family members and Dermot Desmond, but it was hardly an overnight success, struggling uphill in a fairly challenging regulatory environment.
In 2015, drinking a triple-espresso during a lengthy an interview with The Sunday Business Post, he likened himself to the main character in the movie There Will Be Blood.
Even after 13 years of waiting, with a stock exchange flotation along the way and millions more in investment from family members and others, his enthusiasm was undimmed.
“I feel like there’s oil bubbling from the ground in the US, and we’re way ahead,” he said at the time, but it was a slow slog and the company had to find other markets to keep itself going while it waited for regulation.
It would take another three years for the first significant move – the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down a 26-year-old federal law that largely prohibited sports betting in the United States – thus allowing individual states to legislate for sports betting.
That decision has given Smurfit a chance to take a little look back: to re-hash.
“We went in 2013 to launch internet casino gaming for Betfair in New Jersey. Six months after we went public we realised that the simulated gaming business was fantastic and we needed to do as much of it as we could. Now it’s nearly half of all our revenues; 45 per cent, we’ve finally disclosed how big simulated gaming was for us in our accounts. In fact, simulated gaming has, if you like, been the only rationale for continuing in America through this desert of regulation. We’ve had to crawl through the desert in order to reach that oasis. That was Pennsylvania regulating.”
“It’s been hard yards. This has been an epic marathon. We all thought it would be a sprint.”
And now, after being forced to carve out new business channels to keep them afloat as the legalising of gambling in the US took its sweet time, it seems like it’s finally happening.
So just how big is the market for sports betting?
“We think that if you look at the total casino market, which is $70 billion a year, the sports betting opportunity in the retail channel isn’t that big – it’s $5 billion to $7 billion. That’s still huge, but not relative to the size of the casino market.”
That’s the retail channel, though, with individual gamblers going to a betting establishment like a casino and laying a bet. That’s not where Smurfit is looking.
“As we know from Europe, through mobile principally, sports betting online is absolutely huge,” he said. “Literally, sports betting online doubles the market. Literally.”
He’s not exaggerating (and GAN’s share price has almost doubled as well, from 36 pence before the news to almost 62 pence at the end of this week). Some analysts believe that the market in illegal betting is already worth around $150 billion in the US.
The tricky bit is quantifying it though, since it is up to each state to actually make the laws that will fulfil those market projections – and some may decide not to.
Smurfit has spent his time plotting out how regulation will roll, now that the ball has started.
“We think over the course of the next three years we can see 12 states regulating online sports betting and online casino,” he said. “Six will pop over the next six months.”
When it happens, Smurfit and GAN will be ready.
“Basically, what happened is in the fourth quarter of last year we had a strategic review for what we were going to do in 2018, and what we were going to get ready to do,” he said. “The biggest obvious thing was: what if sports betting regulates? If it does, we need to make sure as a provider to our clients that we can switch on sports – literally just add a sports betting section.”
“So, over the last six months, we’ve been busy technically working to integrate not just one but two different sports betting options and now they’re available to our clients, with a third sports betting option nearly ready.”
Core to their ability to take advantage of this growing market is their relationship with Paddy Power Betfair, which started with Betfair long before the merger. And Paddy Power Betfair is set to get bigger with the news that it has bid for online fantasy sports business Fan Duel – just a few weeks after GAN renewed its contract with Paddy Power for its gaming operations in New Jersey, where betting is already legal.
As Paddy Power grows – and its sports offering will accelerate that – so will GAN.
Then there are his existing relationships with a number of casinos, all of which are likely to be looking for sports betting software.
Smurfit is coy about just who else he’s talking to, though.
“We’ve been talking to a lot of different people continuously for the last six months. One of the critical issues is that people just don’t have the tech resources to deliver all the demand in the market.”
GAN could do with the boost. Though its gross income rose from £31.7 million to £41.1 million in 2017 – a 30 per cent increase – its pre-tax losses fell only slightly, from £5.1 million to £4.2 million.
Which perhaps explains why Smurfit won’t be abandoning the simulated gaming business just because of the Supreme Court’s decision.
“Simulated gaming is absolutely a key part of our market strategy. Because we develop relationships with casinos in states before these states regulate, so it’s still an incredibly important strategy for increasing our market share,” he said. “We’re taking market share before regulation arrives.”
In the meantime, Smurfit has shown he can be patient. This week’s Supreme Court decision has proved that the rewards are there.
“As chief executive, I have the most information on what GAN is doing and what we expect to do over the balance of the year. All the conversations we’re having on simulated gaming and real money gaming, all the conversations we’re having in the other parts of the universe, they’re all coming together and I can see absolutely how the market has had a wake-up call on GAN,” he said.
“If we hadn’t taken that bet and started the journey, we wouldn’t be where we are now.”

The high cost of ignoring IoT security
Sunday Business Post

Length: 822 words
Byline: Quinton O'Reilly
Highlight: To add security measures would cause IoT devices to cost far more - which is why no one is doing it, leaving businesses with a host of unknown vulnerabilities, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body


No matter in which direction the Internet of Things (IoT) goes, security will continue to be a significant issue and figuring out how to deal with this new landscape is a big challenge.
Talk about the subject of IoT and eventually the conversation will fall on the topic of security.
One of the biggest concerns with IoT devices is how security can be an afterthought, if thought of at all.
“One of the biggest challenges that we have, and everybody is in agreement with this, is IoT and the cost of IoT,” said Steve Mulhearn, director of enhanced technologies UKI & DACH at Fortinet. “Forget about the security, it’s all down to cost and a lot of these devices are relatively low-cost to manufacture, therefore to add security to them would increase the costs of them dramatically.”
There are two reasons for this, said Mulhearn. First is that technical knowledge is expensive while the other more worrying element is that none of these devices are built from the ground up with security in mind.
If you take a headless device - one that has no screen, keyboard or method of input - they tend to use freeware or open-source software to run, as they’re free. All of these factors combined means you have devices that are full of vulnerabilities.
“Even to patch the operating system is an overhead for them so they just don’t do it, said Mulhearn. “It’s somebody else’s problem, as far as they’re concerned, whether you connect it up.
[caption id="attachment_416794" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Steve Mulhearn, director of enhanced technologies UKI & DACH at Fortinet[/caption]
“That’s fine until it lands on your doorstep as a business or industry or consumer because it’s then your problem, but very few people are realising the security implications that a lot of these devices have.
“A lot of them have backdoors, and default passwords, all different things that would never be normally allowed, but because there are commercial drivers connecting these devices and applications, people are allowing them to be connected to networks that they would never allow to be connected to.
“If someone was to come to you and say you have a server, I just want to plug it into your network, but it’s never been patched, it’s got a whole heap of vulnerabilities and I know it’s insecure, but that’s okay, you’d never let it happen.”
Since IoT devices tend to have no interface, many people may think they’re dumb devices, only carrying out the task they’re made for, but operating systems can be hijacked by nefarious actors and owners may not be aware it happened. As the next wave of IoT devices emerges, this is going to be a problem that businesses will need to think about.
Mulhearn recommends that businesses as a whole look at acceptable risk to help improve the situation. There’s no software that you can instal and it will keep your devices safe, but you can work around the idea that these devices aren’t secure and develop countermeasures around that.
He states that this can be quite a challenge as it involves segmenting parts of a business’s network and accepting that said devices are going to be compromised. At least through segmentation, you limit how much damage it can cause.
“You almost want to have different zones within a network . . . that effectively have different levels or acceptable levels of security,” he said. “[If] I have a basic IoT device, it’s never been tested, it’s riddled with vulnerabilities, but you know what, it can connect out to the internet and will accept connections with certain clients, but that is it, it’s not allowed to go anywhere else.
“It’s not the devices themselves that are the problem; it’s when that device is used as a stepping stone for something else.
“That’s what you’ve got to remember. It is really tough, it’s not easy for companies, but they have to be looking at classifying these devices as the risk that they pose to the business and as they say, we have a security device, if you have a firewall, that’s level one. That’s one of the more secure devices you’ll ever get because it’s tested at an end level because of what it does.”
The processes that businesses follow to protect traditional devices like smartphones and PCs will be different to how IoT should be approached. The three steps Fortinet follows with IoT, ‘learn, segment and protect’, will be ones that businesses will have to follow if they start embracing the IoT space.
“[It’s] very different and it’s not like I can buy software to protect these devices,” he said.
“I can’t, so I have to use some form of segmentation. We do a lot of research into IoT and vulnerability and all the rest of it so we can stop specifics, but the problem that you have is the number of IoT devices out there in other words . . . it makes it really tough because we can’t test every single product, we go for the majority of operating systems. We’ll stop well-known vulnerabilities being accessed, but we can’t guarantee all of them.”

The Magnificent X7

Highlight: BMW readies its seventh SUV, with seven seats – and we’re in seventh heaven after driving a prototype 
Body


Next year, it will be the 20th anniversary of BMW’s brave decision to enter, for the first time, the world of the sports utility vehicle – or the SUV. The original entrant to the SUV fold, wearing a blue-and-white propeller badge, was the X5 and it has gone on to be a huge commercial success for BMW. Both it, and the X6 that is derived from it (and which launched in 2008), have sold in excess of two million units worldwide in just shy of two decades.
When the X5 was first announced, it was a daring move by BMW that upset fans of the marque. Built to capitalise on a growth in SUV sales in the 1990s, and to also address a yawning gap in the 4x4 market – between the ‘worthy’ Japanese machines of the day that made up the affordable end of the market and the sole luxury SUV offering – the long-serving Range Rover, it nevertheless abandoned BMW’s traditional heartland of sporty cars, which at the time were all rear-wheel drive saloons, estates, roadsters or coupes.
There was a brief backlash against SUVs in the 2000s, which perhaps slowed BMW’s X-line expansion plans, but a resurgence in demand for high-riding vehicles in the 2010s has seen the X range grow. Today there are six model groups: the X3 joined the X5 first, then the aforementioned X6 was introduced, before the X1, X4 and X2 completed the picture.
[caption id="attachment_416895" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] The X7 is a world-beating piece of engineering[/caption]
However, despite their expense and desirability factor, in some global markets there is a belief that the X5 and X6 are not quite large enough machines; specifically, in terms of their seating capacity. The X5, in particular, is about to transition from the Mk3 to the Mk4 and both generations offer a seven-seat option, but that is more of what is called a ‘5+2’ arrangement, where the third row of seats are semi-occasional items for smaller children only.
Thus, the next SUV that will join the X-family is the X7. Imagined as an analogue to the current BMW flagship, the 7 Series limousine, the X7 is a 5.1 metre-long, 2.3-tonne SUV with seven full-sized seats aboard.
It will be in huge demand in the likes of the US and Middle East, for slightly different reasons. In the States, it will be bought for its practicality and capaciousness, but in the Middle East, it will be more of a status symbol as the ultimate BMW SUV, and, of course, other countries around the world will enjoy its particular charms.
At the moment, the X7 is still in the developmental stage, around ‘80 per cent’ complete according to the design and engineering team behind it. The on-sale launch is slated for early 2019. The vehicle’s main aim, beyond offering seven seats as standard, with a six-seat ‘luxury’ layout an option, is to provide the most opulent and comfortable experience possible in any BMW SUV; it is, put it most simply, a taller 7 Series with a bigger boot.
To that end, all X7s will come as standard with twin-axle adaptive air suspension, an eight-speed automatic transmission, faster-reacting xDrive all-wheel drive, the latest iDrive 7 infotainment system on a 12.3-inch TFT screen, a new design of digital instrument cluster in front of the driver, Gesture Control, a revised design of digital climate controls, and knurled metal features throughout the dashboard.
Options will include a Swarovski crystal gear lever, active anti-roll stabilisation, Integral Active Steering, an Off-Road Package of protective under-body items and a rear-axle limited-slip differential, and a Sport exhaust system.
Power will come from a variety of muscular turbocharged six- and eight-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, with four variants to choose from at launch, split between the two fuels. Selections on the petrol side include the 3.0-litre biturbo straight-six in the xDrive40i (c.340hp/500Nm) or the 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 of the xDrive50i (c.462hp/650Nm), while the diesels are made up of the single-turbo 3.0-litre straight-six unit in the xDrive30d (c.265hp/620Nm) or the same capacity engine but augmented by no fewer than four turbochargers. This performance-oriented version will bear the M50d nomenclature and likely have around 400hp and 760Nm. It’s not clear yet which variants will come to Ireland, but it’s unlikely we’ll get either the V8 petrol or the M50d.
Having driven a wide spread of the launch models in pre-production prototype form, it’s apparent BMW has hit its design brief target square in the middle. On its air suspension and packed with masses of sound-deadening material, plus acoustic windows for most of the glasshouse, the X7 is a serene cruiser.
It floats along, diffusing the worst lumps and bumps of the tarmac flowing beneath its up-to-22 inch alloy wheels with a graceful, easy effortlessness, while exterior noise contributors are totally excluded from entering the passenger compartment.
All of the engines are more than capable of hauling the big SUV along at decent speeds, with the xDrive40i proving the most impressive of all, given it has the least amount of torque to play with. The standard-fit eight-speed automatic transmission is as seamless and slick here, as it is in every other BMW application, while a series of well-judged, light controls make placing the X7 on the road both simple and stress-free. In truth, despite its sheer physical presence, the X7 never feels overly massive when trying to manoeuvre it about urban streets.
And although BMW says the X7 is a cruiser before it is a sporty vehicle with sharp handling, the chassis nevertheless deserves praise. The X7 continues its trick of shrinking itself around its driver on curvier roads, proving sure-footed and dependable during faster cornering.
Models without the active anti-roll bars do lean more noticeably than the ones with the equipment, but not by so much as to make the X7 ever feel like it is wallowing or that it has loose body control on its air springs. The xDrive all-wheel-traction system also works well at shuffling torque between the axles in an unobtrusive manner, while fitting Integral Active Steer (BMW’s name for four-wheel steering) does make the rear end feel more mobile and the whole car nimbler.
We also tried the X7 off-road and, while the course wasn’t exactly easy, neither was it hugely challenging, but it did prove that the BMW SUV is precisely as capable off the tarmac as owners are ever going to require of it.
With another half-and-a-year or so of development, it’s already plain to see that the X7 SUV is going to be a class-leading vehicle when it launches. BMW will build its largest and grandest product at the Spartanburg plant in the US, which is where most of the X3 to X6 ranges are constructed for worldwide markets. And with SUVs being so lucrative right now, the US factory is obviously a crucial part of BMW’s future success.
So we’ve come a long way since the X5 of 1999, with BMW’s magnificent seventh SUV proving to be a winner. All that remains now is for the German company to round everything out neatly by adding in an X8 and completing its SUV set. It would, like the forthcoming X7, no doubt prove to be a world-beating piece of engineering.
Model: BMW X7 xDrive40i (pre-production prototype)
Engine: 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged six-cylinder petrol
Power: c.340hp
Torque: c.500Nm
Likes: exceptional refinement, impressive handling, interior space, technology levels
Dislikes: likely to be expensive to buy and run

The precariat: who’s in it and who isn’t?

Highlight: The genuine concerns of workers trapped in the insecure platform economy can be addressed without us all worrying about a looming dystopia 
Body


‘The battle for decent work,” said President Michael D Higgins last week, “will be one of the defining struggles of the coming decades.” And on the front lines of that battle are “the precariat”, those whose work is characterised by job insecurity, unpredictable hours, low wages and few rights.
“Precariat” is a neologism, drawn from “precarious” and “proletariat”, coined by French sociologists in the 1980s to describe temporary or seasonal workers and popularised by Guy Standing, the British economist.
Standing identifies the precariat as an emerging new class, characterised by a “distinctive bundle of insecurities” related to their quality of work. If these insecurities are not addressed, he says, this new class could be dangerous. They already experience “the four As – anger, anomie, anxiety and alienation”, he writes, in his bestseller The Precariat.
“They are floating, rudderless and potentially angry, capable of veering to the extreme right or extreme left politically and backing populist demagoguery that plays on their fears or phobias.” Standing wrote this five years before Brexit and Donald Trump’s election.
Standing estimates that a quarter of the adult population of many countries is in the precariat. The Great British Class Survey used Standing’s work: it estimated that the precariat consisted of 15 per cent of British society, making up the bottom rung of a new, seven-step class ladder.
According to an Irish Congress of Trade Unions study, cited by President Higgins, there are 160,000 people in precarious work in Ireland. The three key metrics are part-time work, temporary work and self-employment.
A recent report, Living With Uncertainty, by the think-tank TASC, said the share of part-time work (as a proportion of all work) soared during the recession from 17 per cent to 24 per cent, but has since fallen back to 21.5 per cent.
Temporary employment has fallen from a peak of 10 per cent in 2012 to 7 per cent. And the rate of self-employment has been steady for 20 years, at 19 per cent.
That might suggest the problem is overstated – or, at least, that it is not getting worse. But drill into those figures and they tell another story.
Within each category, the proportion of those who work that way out of necessity, not choice, is rising. Research by Ciarán Nugent of the think-tank NERI has shown that the proportion of those who are involuntarily on temporary contracts has grown considerably; for those under 30, this has grown more dramatically still.
The proportion of those who are involuntarily part-time has also grown: most temporary workers now want to be permanent, and most part-time workers want to be full-time. The proportion of the self-employed who have no employees (which is taken as a very rough indicator of the presence of “bogus” self-employment) has also grown, though marginally.
Relative stability at the macro level also masks dramatic instability at the sectoral level. The construction sector is riven with bogus self-employment. Pre-school staff are prey to short-hour contracts and overwork. Retail and hospitality staff are plagued by “if and when” contracts.
This is a very different scenario to that described by Guy Standing; though his label is vivid, it may be unhelpful.
In the popular understanding, the term “precariat” conflates two distinct things: those who are working in low-paid, low-status insecure jobs because they have no choice, and those whose professions are relatively high-status but have been disrupted by technological change (or have traditionally not been rewarded by the market – artists, for example), leaving them economically vulnerable.
These people make up the gig economy. I’m one of them. I balance a newspaper column with occasional contract media work and my own artistic work. I trade income security for practical and creative freedom.
Where these two phenomena blur into each other is in the platform economy: the use of online platforms to connect worker/seller and consumer, without an employer as middleman. A DJ may do some daytime hours on Deliveroo or Uber to help meet the rent, and cross paths with someone using the platforms full-time for less than minimum wage; that doesn’t mean that their life expectations or outcomes are always comparable.
Standing, and many others, are worried about a coming dystopia when automation will aggravate existing trends and dump us all into the precariat. But there is a twofold danger here: that we reject the extraordinary efficiencies that can be gained from technology in a bid to protect traditional employment that is no longer sustainable, and that we allow the scale of the looming threat to overwhelm us and lose sight of the immediate threat we can tackle now.
The unions, thus, may be both problem and solution. In defending privileges and practices that technology may render obsolete, they risk increasing the cost differential between unionised and precarious workers and exacerbating the dynamics they attempt to fight, as well as further undermining general support for trade unionism. (This is, admittedly, a catch-22: they exist to defend their members.) Yet a close look at the precariat in Ireland suggests that the unions have a crucial role to play.
What is needed is a close, sectoral focus. The problems of workers in the retail, hospitality, pre-school and construction sectors can be addressed without us having to worry about a looming dystopia, and without jeopardising our tech-heavy enterprise policy and culture.
I may have suffered from technological disruption of the media industry but the average consumer-citizen has gained (with caveats). There is much to be gained from other professions moving into the platform economy: I look forward in particular to the coming disruption of the legal sector.
The fact that freelance journalists and lawyers will protest and call themselves the new precariat because they can’t afford to live in south Dublin should not distract from the more urgent problems facing those whose work and lives are genuinely precarious.

Ticket seller Coras seals Ryanair deal Edge-backed firm hits funding of €2.7m

Coras, where investors include U2’s The Edge and a number of leading business people, is ramping up a lucrative partnership with Ryanair across Europe as it seeks to disrupt the stranglehold that players like Ticketmaster have on the market.
It has also set its sights on entering the US market in 2019 and has added investment.
It now has funding of €2.7 million, most recently adding almost three-quarters of a million euro from Elkstone, the wealth manager that looks after the money of model Elle MacPherson and venture capital investor Nicole Junkermann, and investment from Enterprise Ireland.
Adrian Turner, who formerly ran John and Bernie Gallagher’s Crownway Capital, has joined the board of Coras and helps advise on strategy. Coras runs Ryanair’s tickets page, where it sells tickets for West End shows such as the Lion King, or comedy gigs like Bill Bailey and music gigs like the Kaiser Chiefs.
[caption id="attachment_416968" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Mark McLaughlin of Coras[/caption]
Ryanair, which has a customer base of 129 million people, wants to ramp up both the variety of events it offers tickets for in theatre, music and sporting events across Europe and the markets it offers them in, so Coras is powering ahead with driving this.
Coras’s software sits behind companies’ websites and runs the ticket-buying technology for them - and co-founder Mark McLaughlin, a son of stockbroker Kyran McLaughlin, sees this way of buying tickets as the future.
“Consumers are moving towards a model where if they use a website for something they’ll buy tickets there as well. It’s a convenience thing - your credit card details are saved, it’s a lot more seamless. It’s a natural progression: you’re going somewhere, you book a flight, then you book a ticket for a show or a match or a tourist attraction.”
Listed deals giant Priceline bought tours and attractions booker FareHarbor and Tripadvisor acquired a tours and activities tech provider called Bokun in April, while travel site Expedia is increasingly focusing on events and activities.
In Ryanair’s case it’s a major growth area.
“Ryanair is now one of the biggest e-commerce companies in Europe,” said McLaughlin. “Their ancillary revenue sales are something like €1.8 billion - it’s a big part of their business.”
It makes its money by taking a small percentage clip of each ticket that comes through the system and is building up its relationships with music promoters, top sports clubs and entertainment giants such as Kilimanjaro Live, one of the biggest music promoters in Britain and exhibition operator NEC.

Highlight: The rise of nationalism and populism across Europe poses a threat to the area’s economic market 
Body


Two events last week have brought the risk of a political populism revival back onto the front pages of the European press. One: the Italian political establishment finally surrendered to the prospect of the two nationalist parties, left and right, the Five Star Movement and the League, forming a ruling coalition. Two: months after the move to direct rule from Madrid, the Spanish region of Catalonia finally got a new regional government, once again led by a pro-independence president. Both developments underscore a simple and troubling fact: the tide of Euroscepticism, nationalism and populism, the product of economic crises, remains a threat to the eurozone’s economic and financial stability, and the future of its reforms.
Italy has been without a functioning government since December 2016 when the then-prime minister, Matteo Renzi, lost the parliamentary reforms referendum. The bickering across the major establishment parties lasted 15 months and led to a general election on March 4, 2018 marked by bitter and divisive campaigns.
As they went to the polls, a majority of Italians were painfully aware that at the end of 2017, the country’s nominal per capita income stood only two percentage points above the 2000 level, and their real (inflation-adjusted) incomes have been stagnant since the mid-1990s. The country has experienced decades-long stagnation, now exacerbated by the 11 per cent official unemployment rate, higher than at the peak of the eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis in 2012.
[caption id="attachment_416873" align="alignleft" width="411"] Matteo Salvini of the League[/caption]
The Five Star Movement (M5S) ended up winning 227 of 630 lower chamber seats in the March election, 119 more seats than in the 2013 election, thereby becoming the largest party in the parliament. The League came in second place with 125 seats (an increase of 109 on 2013). Similar gains were made by both parties in the senate.
Last Sunday, the M5S and the League announced that they had reached an agreement on a joint program, opening the way to the formation of a coalition government. Then the two spent the rest of the week arguing about the key modalities of their policies.
Both the League and the Five Star Movement historically have deep Eurosceptic roots, although both have substantially moderated their views in recent years. The far-right League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, has been more outspoken on the need for Italy to gain more autonomy from Brussels than his M5S counterpart, Luigi Di Maio. The two parties are close in their positions when it comes to opposing the EU-imposed fiscal austerity and banking regulations, as well as their staunch resistance to the common migration rules and policies.
Put succinctly, at the end of this week, the eurozone’s third-largest economy is to be taken over by the coalition, whose platform is incompatible with the European drift toward greater fiscal and political integration.
 
 
Things are no better in the eurozone’s fourth-largest economy. The new political crisis in Spain started back in October, after the referendum in Catalonia triggered a declaration of the region’s intention to seek full breakaway from the Spanish state. A violent response from Madrid followed, with the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, imposing emergency powers to take control over the region.
Another election on December 21 gave a narrow mandate to three pro-independence parties that claimed 70 out of 135 seats in the regional parliament. After months of negotiations, this week, the legislators finally voted in a new regional president, Quim Torra, by a narrow 66-65 vote. Torra wasted no time in declaring that the new government will “implement the [pro-independence] mandate from the October referendum . . . to build an independent state in the form of a republic”.
Catalan’s independence bid is also rooted in economics. The region is by far the wealthiest in Spain, accounting for more than one-fifth of Spain’s GDP with GDP per capita over $39,000. The region’s unemployment rate, having risen in Q4 2017 on foot of a stand-off with Madrid, remains below Spain’s 16 per cent.
Yet growth in the highly competitive region has been held back by the shocks of the 2008-2013 crises, exacerbated by the negative spillovers from Spain. While Catalonia weathered the crises better than the rest of the country, the Spanish banking sector’s collapse has triggered significant calls on the region’s resources, while post-crises austerity policies from Madrid aggravated an already open wound.
The Catalan independence movement is sustained by the broader rise of left-wing populism in Spain. Meanwhile, Italy’s political drift towards the extreme is also anchored in the pro-populist voters’ sentiment. These trends are not unique to the two southern EU states.
According to the TIMBRO Authoritarian Populism Index 2017, published in January this year, in some EU member states such as Cyprus, Italy and Spain, “left-wing anti-establishment parties have now a vote share of 25.7, 28.2 and 21.2 per cent respectively. In Greece, the radical left has a vote share of 45.1 per cent, up from 12.3 per cent in 1980.
Right-wing populist parties have seen their vote share constantly increase between 1980 and today. Their vote share moved upwards, from a record low of 1 per cent in 1982 to an historical high of 12.3 per cent in 2016. However, in 2017, their vote share has stabilised at 12.1 percent.”
More current data from TIMBRO shows that Europe-wide, the average share of votes cast for populist parties currently stands at 19.7 per cent (data as of May 17, 2018), compared to less than 12 per cent in 2000. More importantly, the latest cycle of increasing voter support for populism dates back to the year 2000, accelerating at the start of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, and again in 2014.
All of which spells trouble for the eurozone from monetary and fiscal perspectives.
The M5S-League coalition plans, released earlier this week, call for a renegotiation of the eurozone’s financial and fiscal rules, the creation of an opt-out mechanism for member states to exit the euro, and a sizable increase in Italian deficits to fund a universal basic income scheme, tax cuts, and a generous pensions reform.
All of these proposals largely dovetail with the policies positions of the Spanish Left as well as the Catalan – and French –populists. In simple terms, all hopes for fiscal and monetary reforms in the eurozone have now been put on ice.
This week’s developments also present an unresolvable monetary policy dilemma. Both Spanish and Italian banks and other systemically important financial intermediaries are heavily vested into government debt. Rising yields on these assets will exact a toll on the financial system and economic growth in the region.
Thus, with the latest developments in Italy and Spain, the ECB is faced with an ugly choice.
Option A: retain independence by normalising the monetary policy as planned at the year end, risking the collapse of Italian economy and banking system, while further fuelling Spanish and French political discontent.
Option B: keep monetary policy loose to help Rome and Madrid finance their debts and political ‘normalisation’ processes, while undermining the credibility of the euro and reducing the policy room for tackling future shocks.
Both alternatives present a challenge for Ireland.
In the case of the first option, the decoupling of credit yields across the eurozone will put pressure on Irish banks and borrowers through increasing the cost of interbank credit. The ECB lifting the base rates in time will also add to the household and corporate credit squeeze.
A recession in three of Europe’s four largest economies will threaten to trigger a significant decrease in the aggregate demand for Irish exports. On the other hand, with the second option, the extension of accommodative monetary policies to suit the needs of Italy and Spain will further inflate Irish house prices and could increase the risk concentration on the banks’ balance sheets, leading to greater risks in the longer term.
Either choice is an ugly one. And this dilemma, just like the surge of populist politics in Europe, can be traced back to the lack of structural reforms that was exposed by the global financial crisis and the eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2008-2013.

Highlight: As the US finally opens itself up to gambling, Britain’s outlook is much gloomier 
Body


It was a hugely significant week for the betting industry, starting with a monumental announcement on Monday from across the Atlantic.
The United States Supreme Court belatedly ended a 26-year ban on betting on professional and college sports. The court’s decision permits state officials to pass laws permitting books to open on sports. It seems astonishing that it has taken this long – but then we are talking about a country that elected Donald Trump as its leader.
The land that pioneered privatised prisons, allows one to carry an unconcealed firearm in public, and buy cigarettes in the pharmacy, finally will no longer be able to stop you having ten dollars on the Giants to win the SuperBowl – at least legally.
I conversed with a cousin about it all in New York. “Huge,” he said, “but I still feel the local bookmaker who extends credit will thrive.” Those who had shares in Paddy Power – its stock has risen around 20 per cent since the announcement – are thriving too.
Less of a bombshell was Thursday’s development across the Irish Sea, which seems to have had minimal effect on the Paddy Power share quote but will certainly have its main rivals fretting. The British government will slash the maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) to £2 from £100 to reduce the risk of “gambling-related harm”. It said the move will cut the risk of potentially large financial losses from the controversial machines as well as harm to both players and wider communities.
The British bookmaking giants are deeply concerned about the future of shops and they have every reason to be. There are roughly 9,000 betting shops in Britain and each shop has four FOBTs generating an average of just under £1,000 in profit per week.
Anyone who visits a bookies over there is likely to note how busy the machines are, while the staff behind the window screen alleviate boredom by texting their mates. Online killed the betting shop star, and retail must greet an uncertain future, with some shop closures inevitable.
Racing, which has long been entirely self-serving when it comes to the ethics of how it is funded, will be worrying too – so it was encouraging to hear the words of Nick Rust, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, after Thursday’s news.
“British racing has a strong social conscience and we support measures announced by the government today to reduce the harm caused by problem gambling. We are also an industry that generates significant employment, provides education and training and funds charitable work, particularly in rural areas,” he said, adding that it was “too early” to speculate as to how racing’s finances would be harmed from all of this. “Our estimates before today’s decision ranged from £40 million to £60 million per year, once the impact of the changes has filtered through into racing.”
It was easy to forget about all these things at Ballydoyle on Monday, when Investec invited what seemed like every racing journalist in Britain – and a few local hacks – to Aidan O’Brien’s yard to officially launch the Derby, which takes place on June 2.
Having access to a relatively unguarded O’Brien was a novelty the visiting media were intent on taking advantage of, the great man interrogated like never before. Questions were wide, wild and varied, from the prospects of Saxon Warrior winning the Triple Crown to whether or not he went to bed at night saying prayers for his horses.
It was comical stuff at times, O’Brien’s regard for Saxon Warrior nevertheless impossible to get away from. The easy Guineas winner is odds-on for the Derby and seemingly bound for the Leger after that as he bids to emulate Nijinsky, the last Triple Crown winner (1970).
Saxon Warrior’s dam, Maybe, failed to stay the Derby distance and neither did his full sister Pavlenko, so to assume that he will is probably foolish. Stamina is no concern for Young Rascal, who won a Newbury maiden on his reappearance in the style of a star and whose ready win in his Chester trial was all the more laudable given that he encountered serious traffic problems.

US healthcare provider to probe smear test scandal lab

The lab at the centre of Ireland’s cervical cancer crisis is being reviewed by a large healthcare provider in the United States.
Baylor College of Medicine, a designated cancer centre in Texas, confirmed it had initiated a review of the accuracy of Pap smears at Clinical Pathology Laboratories (CPL).
Clinical Pathology Laboratories is the same lab that processed the sample from Vicky Phelan.
It settled Phelan’s legal action for €2.5 million after it did not detect abnormalities on her cervical smear sample.
Dr Thomas Wheeler, chief of pathology at Baylor, told this newspaper that the review had been triggered by negative media coverage of events in Ireland.
Wheeler said this had alarmed some members of the public in Texas and that Baylor had initiated the review to reassure the public.
“We had and still have a lot of confidence in CPL. We have done some preliminary analysis and we are very satisfied,” Wheeler said.
He said laboratories in the United States were “highly regulated”.
Doctors in Ireland have expressed concern at the potential financial liability that could arise for CervicalCheck and the impact this crisis will have on healthcare and screening into the future.
Various studies and organisations – including the American Society of Cytopathology – state that experience indicates an irreducible false negative rate of around 5 per cent.
A leading cancer specialist said: “We need to know if our preventable false negatives are more common than those reported by other leading countries.
“Even if they are not, underwriting a policy of routine redress for screening failure could be more expensive than the screening programmes themselves.”
Donal Brennan, a professor of gynaecological oncology and consultant obstetrician, said he was concerned about the potential impact of the CervicalCheck crisis on screening and quality assurance.
Brennan said false negatives had only come to light because of an audit process, which was initiated to improve the screening service.
He said the fallout could “stop a lot of quality assurance and audit in future. In the long term that could lead to standards falling”.

We often call him politically naive, but it is more fitting to say that he was way ahead of his time; Ireland of the 1940s and 1950s was not ready for Noël Browne. By doing what he felt was right, he sacrificed his career.

Highlight: Noël Browne – doctor, politician and one-time health minister – knew a thing or two about getting stuff done 
Body


Seanad Éireann as it is at present constituted should be abolished. These are not my words, but those of Dr Noël Browne TD, who in November 1957 tabled a Dáil motion calling for the abolition of the Seanad.
Tired as I am of waiting for the implementation of Seanad reform, if Dr Browne were to appear and advocate its abolition today I might be minded to support him. On this issue, my faith in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for his apparent energy and freshness of approach seems to have been misplaced; his singular contribution to Seanad reform has been to commission yet another report. For radicalism and delivery, it seems that we need to look elsewhere.
Noël Browne – doctor, politician and one-time health minister – knew a thing or two about getting stuff done.
Tomorrow marks 21 years since his death. His life is charted in two excellent books: his autobiography Against the Tide, which has sold more than 80,000 copies, and a biography by Professor John Horgan entitled Noël Browne: Passionate Outsider.
Academics also have the benefit of his papers, which are deposited in the library in Trinity College. Having cajoled him onto the Stardust committee in the 1980s, I came to know and admire Browne. While in political terms we were at the opposite ends of the spectrum, we never let mere politics get in the way.
Like all of us, he had his failings: his stubbornness, his seeming inability to toe the party line (which saw him serve in five political parties through his career), and the bitterness he seemed to harbour towards some of his political opponents. But in spite of his failings, people in business as well as politics could learn much from Browne and how he went about securing some groundbreaking achievements during his career.
In 1948, he ran for the Dáil in Dublin South East – then a newly formed constituency which has since been the stomping ground of Garret FitzGerald, Michael McDowell, Ruairí Quinn and Lucinda Creighton. He succeeded on his first outing and was appointed minister for health on his first day in the Dáil, aged 33, in the interparty government led by Fine Gael Taoiseach John A Costello. It was a time when the Catholic Church was a dominant force in all aspects of the state and politicians who stepped out of line were prone to a ‘belt of the crozier’.
His approach to his ministry was coloured with a high degree of suspicion towards his civil servants, who he feared might wish to curtail his crusader tendencies. He was very much the man in charge. As health minister he mastered his brief, not merely in the sense of being adept at reading briefs and robotically regurgitating their content, but in being deeply knowledgeable of the ins and outs of the topic at hand.
In the early decades of the new state, tuberculosis claimed the lives of thousands of Irish people. Having lost his parents and two siblings to TB, and having suffered from the disease himself, Browne brought to his ministry a determination to do all he could to eradicate it.
On taking office, he recalls having “the Department of Health . . . transformed into a battle headquarters”, focused on tackling the TB epidemic. This almost militaristic approach extended even to the point of arranging for the installation in his office of a wall chart which detailed the construction status of every proposed sanatorium and hospital.
Ever the innovator, he was able to circumvent the Department of Finance’s tight grip of the purse strings by commandeering funding from the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes. Aided by the development of new drugs and vaccines, he embarked on a sustained drive to build additional hospitals and sanatoriums in the battle against the disease.
By July 1950 he had delivered 2,000 extra beds for TB patients with a result that the death rate from TB fell from 123 per 100,000 in 1947 to 73 per 100,000 in 1955: a remarkable achievement by any measure.
His other achievements include the establishment of the national blood transfusion service and the introduction of the BCG vaccine for newborn children. He was one of the first politicians to question and criticise corporal punishment, which was regularly meted out to students in school. He was a vocal opponent of capital punishment. He fought for those detained as involuntary patients in the state’s mental institutions. However, none of his political projects was more controversial, and ultimately more damaging to him, than the ill-fated Mother and Child scheme.
As minister, Browne sought to implement this scheme, which had been put forward by the previous Fianna Fáil government in the Health Act 1947. The Mother and Child Scheme was intended to tackle the high rates of child mortality by providing free medical care for mothers and children under the age of 16 without a means test. The plan caused great angst among the Catholic hierarchy who viewed it as a communist-leaning policy and feared that it would lead to the introduction of contraceptives.
Browne was summoned by Archbishop John Charles McQuaid to be told in no uncertain terms that his new law would “constitute a ready-made instrument for future totalitarian aggression”.
He also had to face down the vested interests of the medical profession who saw the plan as a threat to their incomes, and there was strong opposition to it from within Cabinet itself. In spite of having taken advice from a trusted theologian, and attempting to compromise in order to accommodate the demands of the Church, his determination to press ahead with the scheme led to his resignation in April 1951.
The debacle also exposed a faultline in the interparty government which collapsed soon afterwards.
Looking back on this sorry saga now, we can see that Ireland of the past was indeed another country. When the government introduced free GP visits for children under six in 2015, no one batted an eyelid. In so many ways we have progressed, but in other ways less so. The sad reality, of course, is that while the Catholic hierarchy were getting exercised about aspects of the Mother and Child scheme, their attention and ire really ought to have been directed at the clerics who, in that age of deference, preyed on the most vulnerable in society.
After many years as a backbencher and years spent in retirement at his home in the west of Ireland, Browne died in Galway in 1997, aged 81.
Robert Ballagh painted an iconic full-length portrait of Browne, which hangs in the National Gallery of Ireland. It depicts him standing on a pebble beach in Connemara. The work is in the shape of a cross and some have said that it recalls Browne’s battles with the Church.
However, the truth as told by Ballagh himself is somewhat less dramatic. When Ballagh set about preparing to paint the picture, he said he had felt overwhelmed by the amount of painting of natural details that would be involved, so he reduced the shape of the canvas and eventually the cruciform design emerged. Pebbles spill out at the foot of the picture and beside them are inscribed the names of Samuel Beckett and Karl Marx – a gesture which points towards Browne’s thinking and ideology.
A strong socialist philosophy was a driving force for Browne. While he and I would not have agreed on many things, it is difficult to not be in awe of the strength of character he showed in taking on the TB epidemic and his determination to deliver on the Mother and Child scheme. With the benefit of hindsight we call him politically naive, but it seems more fitting to say that he was a man who was way ahead of his time;
Ireland of the 1940s and 1950s was not ready for Noël Browne. In trying to do what he felt was right by the people, he sacrificed his career.
We live in a time when our mainstream politicians cast a finger in the air to tell which way public opinion is heading and they go with it. Never one to court popularity, Browne was a fiercely dedicated public servant who shunned the option of setting up a lucrative private practice on the basis that “I could not consider the need to take money from a patient for any help which I might have given to them”. So he dedicated his medical career and ministerial career to the treatment and betterment of the poor and the sick.
One of the poignant lessons of his career is that a political outsider who takes office and is not in thrall to the establishment can make a real difference, even in a relatively short time.
We would do well to remember him: his staunchly principled approach, the strength of character he showed in his battles, but most of all his achievements.

Highlight: After a hugely successful career in Saudi Arabia, Maurice O’Gorman came back to Ireland to help set up the now thriving Galway City Innovation District

Role: chair of the Galway City Innovation District
Age: 52
Family: married with three children
Just finished reading: Deep Work by Carl Newport

A converted shed beside a train station in Galway feels like a lifetime away from Maurice O’Gorman’s previous workplace in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh. After 25 years in the Middle East, O’Gorman was drawn back to Ireland in search of a new challenge.
That challenge came about through conversations with NUIG academic John Breslin and Altocloud founder Barry O’Sullivan, who asked him to get involved with the fledgling Galway City Innovation District (GCID).
“We wanted to show that Galway was a great place to build companies from,” says O’Gorman. “We did some work on an economic development plan and the stats weren’t great. We started doing events in pubs and were getting really big crowds, so we saw there was a lot of demand.”
They decided to find a permanent home for GCID, and found it in the Portershed. The site had a lot going for it, including the fact that it was right off Eyre Square in the heart of the city.
“It was a CIE building that had been unused for a very long time, and we managed to negotiate a 15-year lease before going around knocking on doors to raise the money to refurbish it. More or less, since day one it’s been full,” he says.
Getting the site to be more than just a place of work has been a core objective from the start: a group of transition-year school students are coming in to design transport routes for the city on the day I speak to O’Gorman. He wants the building to act as a place to get people thinking about making Galway better.
“We hold about four events a week, varying from quite small to hundreds of people. That’s drawing people into the Portershed from a much wider community. We’re becoming the evangelists for entrepreneurship in Galway,” he says.
“When foreign direct investment companies are looking at the region, we bring them in, give them a free desk and introduce them to suppliers and academia. We’ve had 28 international delegations in the two years since we opened.”
In the five years since O’Gorman came to settle in Galway, an awful lot has changed.
He first bought a house there with his wife Jacinta at the start of his time in Saudi Arabia, having grown up in Middlesbrough with Irish parents. The son of emigrants, he knew the well-trodden path and sees a change in how young people are treating life in Galway today.
“The old story of people graduating and leaving is gone. Graduates are seeing that they can try their hand at something in Galway. That’s key to what we are trying to do, to show them they can grow a global business from here.”
Ensuring there is enough room for these ideas is a different matter. With the Portershed having been at capacity for most its two years on the go, space is at a premium for businesses at all stages in the city.
“We’re ploughing ahead with our plans for Portershed 2. It’s desperately needed. Look at the Altocloud team. They started with three people and have grown to 26. There’s nowhere for them to go. We want to either do it ourselves or do it in partnership,” says O’Gorman.
“A lot of stuff that has been built in Galway didn’t have entrepreneurship in mind. A lot of money went into hotels and shopping not into office space, particularly flexible office space.”
Having a network in the city offers some relief in terms of space. Bank of Ireland has its Workbench and Startlab sites but Superpixel, which was across the road from the train station, has shut down its co-working space to focus on its core business.
“If someone comes in tomorrow morning and we can’t accommodate them, the first thing we do is phone around everyone else and see if they can help. The demand in town is something else. It’s really sad to have to turn people away and we would love to be able to say we could accommodate everyone.
“The reality is there’s not enough space. That’s a real issue for the IDA. They bring in great companies, but it always gets to that point where the company asks where it could set up with plans to grow to 300.”
The questions O’Gorman is trying to answer today would never have crossed his mind in his previous life. He started out in the London Stock Exchange in the insider dealing group, which investigated criminal offences.
“We built an artificial intelligence engine that was giving us the leads to work on. It was a great experience through the late 1980s and early 1990s,” he says.
While he was working in London, his career took a dramatic turn. He was sent to Saudi Arabia to examine its trading set-up and report back.
“I went out to provide support and found a store where they sold sheep and shares. There were lots of people trading shares but no actual exchanges,” he says.
O’Gorman prepared a report and was offered the chance to implement it. This led to him setting up Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange along with its regulatory body, all before his 30th birthday. The vigour of youth meant he wanted to aim big and move fast.
“It was the world’s first fully electronic stock exchange. As a young person, to be given the opportunity where they say: ‘Here’s the budget, go and make this happen’ was incredibly exciting,” he says.
“That’s the great thing about being young. There’s probably some mathematical equation that shows you can have more failures when you are young and fewer as you get older. My attitude was that we weren’t going to fail.”
At the time, what O’Gorman’s team was doing was unheard of. Everything in the exchange was memory-resident, meaning it existed in the cloud before the cloud even existed.
From there he went on to help set up NCB Capital Investment before eventually deciding to treat Galway as where he lived rather than where he had a house. By then he and his wife had three children, which gave him an appreciation for not needing everything to happen instantly.
“In my old life, by 7.30am I’d know how the Dow did, how the Asian markets were performing, and what was happening in London. Now I don’t look at the markets, because it’s just not relevant,” he says.
“It’s about working out how to build up the Portershed, how to build up enterprise space, how to develop Galway harbour, looking at housing issues – they are all longer term issues that require more planning.”
More than any words from O’Sullivan or Breslin, it was the practical desire to build a family home that changed O’Gorman’s outlook.
“I knew when I came back that I’d take time off. We wanted to build our new house and Jacinta said it would never get done if I kept working the way I was, being in six different countries in a week. She said if we were going to build the house then I’d need to do something different,” he says.
That led to him looking at ways he could help the city in a voluntary capacity. He saw his experience in building projects from the ground up as a natural point to make an impact. Having witnessed the speed of Riyadh’s development, O’Gorman feels there’s an advantage for businesses in growing somewhere more relaxed like Galway.
“You can be on this merry go round where it’s always fast-paced, but you need to sit down at times and really focus on things. Galway gives you that breathing space. You can’t solve big problems when you are in constant motion.”
Despite the calming benefits of the city, he still wants to do more to prepare Galway for the next step in its growth, and he wants the government to think hard about what it wants from the western capital.
“I’d like a more coordinated approach under Project 2040 as to how we build up cities with a spatial plan, an economic plan, a plan around healthcare.
“There needs to be an overall plan for Galway. For somewhere like Galway to be complementary to Dublin, there needs to be a coordinated approach. The big thing that’s missing is an overall master plan.
“Ultimately it’s government who owns this. I thought the planning framework for Galway was underwhelming. You need that overall masterplan because you need to think about how you move people around, how people are going to get into and out of the city in the future. The motorway is fantastic, but once you get to the end of it, there’s an absolute bottleneck.”
It’s that need for a plan that draws O’Gorman’s thoughts back to Riyadh, where a project that began before he was a father is now blossoming. He wants the same kind of forward planning for his new home.
“One of the projects I worked on for the Saudi government was the development of the King Abdullah Financial District,” he says. “We set out a plan that was to be rolled out over ten years, but we extended it to look 25 years down the line. That plan is still there today, for a city that is much bigger than Galway, and it is being followed. What’s going in now is the metro system. That was planned to go in once a certain scale of people was reached.

Highlight: The stakes are still high as Together for Yes and Save the 8th prepare for battle in the last week of the campaign 
Body


The result of the referendum on the Eighth Amendment will be heard around the world. For weeks now, international broadcasters have been preparing for live feeds from the national results centre in Dublin Castle.
And as one of them told me recently, the story they are coming for is a simple one. The end of old Catholic Ireland, as the country joins other EU states in liberalising its abortion laws. The black and white footage of the bishops presiding over state events and the colour footage of Pope John Paul II saying mass for one million people in the Phoenix Park in 1979 is being lined up in anticipation.
On the face of it, the latest Sunday Business Post/Red C poll suggests that the momentum is with the Yes side that as the campaign enters its final week, those international broadcasters will not be disappointed.
The Yes side has managed to increase its lead with 56 per cent in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment, which gives equal protection to the life of the mother and the unborn. This is a three point increase on last month’s poll, while the No side is up by just one point to 27 per cent.
But a deeper analysis by Red C, using its ‘wisdom of crowds’ technique suggests that it is not that simple. The company’s researchers asked voters what they thought the result of the referendum would be, based on the conversations they had had on the subject with friends and family and on what they had heard so far during the campaign. The end result was 56 per cent Yes and 44 per cent No.
So there are still high stakes in the last week of the campaign, which is why there will be another big canvassing push from Together for Yes on one side and the Save the 8th campaign on the other.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who has upped his activity in the past week, will be in Tullamore in Offaly today with Minister for Health Simon Harris.
But to some extent, both of them have had their role in the Yes campaign diminished by the need to respond to the cervical check scandal. Both sides have claimed privately that this will work to their advantage. Those on the Yes side say that it shows that women’s health continues to be a problem in Ireland, and that the Eighth Amendment is part of that. Those on the No side say that the state’s failure to inform women about incorrect smear tests will only reinforce their message that it cannot be trusted to introduce safe abortions here either.
The latest Red C poll suggests that the referendum result will also renew the debate about the urban-rural divide. Or more accurately, the difference in attitudes between Dublin and the rest of the country.
When undecided voters are reallocated, the predicted Yes vote in Dublin is 72 per cent versus 29 per cent for No. But the gap is much closer in the rest of Leinster, where the Yes vote is on 55 per cent verus 45 per cent. In Munster, the Yes vote is 51 per cent versus 49 per cent No. And in Connacht/Ulster, the No side are in the ascendancy on 51 per cent versus 49 per cent for No.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has gone against the majority of his own parliamentary party by advocating a Yes vote. In doing so, he is in tune with the majority of voters in Dublin where his party desperately needs to regain seats. But he does risk alienating older Fianna Fáil supporters in rural areas.
However, former Fianna Fáil minister Máire Geoghegan Quinn, who served as European Commissioner, said she was very proud of Martin’s stance.
“I think it took enormous courage for him to take the line that he has taken on this referendum. Regardless of how conservative he might be, and his own personal feelings, he has put the issue above his own personal conviction,” she said.
But if the referendum were to be defeated, Martin would face a severe backlash from those in his party who are already ill-disposed towards his leadership. To avoid a potential leadership heave, he might be forced to seek an early general election despite his own wishes to pass a third budget under the confidence and supply deal with Fine Gael.
The stakes are also high for Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who has played a prominent role in the Yes campaign. There is less division in the Sinn Féin parliamentary party with just two TDs – Peadar Toibín and Carole Nolan- opposing her stance. But the party still has to hold its annual Ard Fheis in the Waterfront Hall in Belfast in June to vote on whether or not to support the proposed legislation for abortion up to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
This is a referendum campaign where there is still a significant chunk of voters who are afraid of revealing their intentions. The subject of abortion is intensely personal, especially given the oft-quoted statistic that over 180,000 Irish women have travelled to Britain for abortions since the Eighth Amendment was put into the constitution in 1983.
The plight of women who have to travel abroad for abortion – or to take abortion pills here ordered over the internet - has been emphasised by the Yes side throughout the campaign. The argument is that abortion is a reality in Ireland. They have also used the ‘hard cases’ of how the Eighth Amendment prevents women from having abortions in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, rape or incest.
However, the No side have focused heavily on displaying pictures of unborn babies in the womb and emphasising their humanity. They have put their own hard cases on posters, such as the statistic that 90 per cent of unborn children diagnosed with Down’s Syndrome are aborted in Britain.
The Catholic Primate of All Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, has warned that repealing the Eighth Amendment would lead to a ‘very liberal abortion regime in Ireland’. In a video sent while on pilgrimage to Lourdes, he said that the referendum was about compassion for two lives – the mother and the unborn child.
“That little unborn child in the ultrasound scan is the same baby, that if given a chance, will be born and grow further through infancy to adolescence to adulthood and to old age,” he said.
There has been an intense debate during the campaign about the legislation that will follow if the Eighth Amendment is repealed. The Red C poll shows that support for allowing abortion without restriction in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy – as recommended by the special Oireachtas committee – has remained steady during the four Sunday Business Post/Red C polls. It was at 51 per cent back in January and it is at 52 per cent now. Those opposed have increased from 27 per cent in January to 34 per cent now.
But again, when the undecided voters are allocated largely to the No side based on past experience, the gap is much tighter. The support for the 12 weeks proposal is around the same level, at 53 per cent but those opposed to it rise to 47 per cent.
There will be a Primetime debate on RTE on Tuesday featuring Minister for Health Simon Harris on the Yes side and Sinn Féin TD Peadar Toibín on the No side. At this point, there is very little time left for the No side to close the gap.
But the turnout for the referendum on Friday could be well in excess of the 60.5 per cent turnout for the same sex marriage referendum. Around eight in ten of those polled by Red C said they would ‘definitely vote’. If younger voters turn out like thet did in 2015, then the clear advantage is with the Yes side. Around 65 per cent of 18-34 year olds are Yes voters.
Even though the No campaign has a lead amongst older voters, it is not as decisive with 54 per cent in favour of No.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that the campaign so far has been respectful ‘by and large’. There have of course been posters torn down and the usual abuse being flung around by the extremes on both sides on social media. But it has been a very emotional and personal campaign for all concerned. There is a hard fall awaiting whoever comes out on the losing side when counting finishes on Saturday.
Yes: 56% No 27% Don’t know 14%
**RED C interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults aged 18+ by telephone between Thursday May 10 and Wednesday May 16. A random digit dial (RDD) method is used to ensure a random selection process of households to be included – this also ensures that ex-directory households are covered. Half of the sample are interviewed using an RDD landline sample, with the other half conducted using an RDD mobile phone sample, this ensures 98 per cent coverage of the population reaching landline only households, mobile only households and those with both a landline and a mobile. Three per cent refused to answer.
In this poll, Red C used the ‘wisdom of crowds’ technique to get a more accurate picture of people’s voting intentions. The question asked people, “as a bit of fun”, to try and estimate what they thought the result of the referendum would be, based on what they had heard so far during the campaign and the conversations they had had on the subject with friends and family.
When Red C used this technique in advance of the same-sex marriage referendum in 2015, it predicted the exact outcome – which was 62 per cent Yes to 38 per cent.

The final Sunday Business Post/Red C poll on the Eighth Amendment referendum suggests a tightening of the race, with just five days to go until polling day.
On the face of it, the Yes side has managed to increase its lead, with 56 per cent in favour of repealing the eighth amendment, which gives equal protection to the life of the mother and the unborn. This is a three-point increase on its showing in last month’s poll, while the No side is up by one point to 27 per cent.
But a deeper analysis of voter intentions by Red C, using the “wisdom of crowds” approach, has suggested that the final result will be much tighter.
Voters were asked which side they believed would win, and the result was 56 per cent for Yes and 44 per cent for No.
When Red C used this technique in advance of the same sex marriage referendum in 2015, it predicted the exact outcome – which was 62 per cent Yes to 38 per cent No. It is aimed at discovering the intention of those who say they “don’t know” when asked about their voting intentions.
Based on previous polling experience, there are a significant number of voters in the “don’t know” category who will turn out to be “shy No” voters on polling day. When Red C reallocated most of these undecided voters to the ‘No’ side, the Yes vote remained at 56 per cent, while the No vote increased significantly to 44 per cent.
The poll of more than 1,000 adults was taken between Thursday, May 10 and Wednesday, May 16. During that period, there was a high-profile referendum debate on the current affairs show Claire Byrne Live on RTE One, as well as intensive canvassing by both sides.

Youth club has not recieved Uefa cash from Bray Wanderers

More than €40,000 in funding intended for children’s and youth soccer has not yet been given over by Bray Wanderers Football Club to its nursery club, St Joseph’s, The Sunday Business Post has learned.
This is one of several financial issues the Seagulls are tackling at present, including tax arrears and an outstanding financial penalty imposed by the Department of Sport.
The monies owed to schoolboy club St Joseph’s AFC is from a Uefa solidarity fund dispersed to League of Ireland clubs by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).
Sources told The Sunday Business Post that these funds must then be passed on to the intended nursery clubs within ten days, but the South Dublin club affectionately known as Joey’s, which has 80 young soccer hopefuls playing in the national league, has not received these funds to date.
Bray and Joey’s have a 20-year relationship and Joey’s has supplied many Bray Wanderers players.
This is one of several pressing matters at Bray Wanderers.
The Revenue Commissioners wrote to the club last week seeking payment within seven days of €11,340 in respect of tax arrears for the first quarter of this year, advising that failure to pay it may lead to court proceedings or a referral to the sheriff or an attachment order.
Some €32,360 relating to a penalty imposed by the Department of Sport for a serious breach in relation to sports capital programme funding is outstanding. The department has advised the club that in order for the club to apply for critically needed fresh sports capital funding by the closing date of June 30, this penalty money must be paid in full.
Receiving a club licence for next season requires all League of Ireland clubs to be tax-compliant and have their financial affairs in order. As part of this the FAI has insisted that Bray maintain a €100,000 escrow account to meet expenses like player salaries.
The accounts of two companies connected with Bray Wanderers, Milway Dawn Ltd and Bray Wanderers Ltd, are not filed up to date at the Companies Registration Office.
“The FAI has been in contact with Bray Wanderers throughout the season and will continue to monitor the situation at the club,” its spokesman said.
Of the monies owed to St Joseph’s the FAI said this was a private matter between the two clubs and Uefa said it was a matter for the FAI.

Investors may be interested in an attractive pre-63 multi-family investment with high reversionary potential at 67 Mountjoy Square in Dublin 1.
Ross Fogarty of Knight Frank is marketing this property at a price in excess of €1.5 million, reflecting a gross initial yield of 6.69 per cent when standard acquisition costs of 4.46 per cent are deducted.
Its central location provides residents with every amenity and service the city centre has to offer, from restaurants, universities, cinemas, offices and shopping, to theatre, museums and medical care.
The property has been sub-divided into 11 residential units and comprises seven one-bed units, two two-bed units, a three-bed unit and one one-bed studio apartment, which cumulatively generate a current rent in the order of €104,760 per annum.
The Georgian building is a protected structure and each unit has individual kitchen and bathroom facilities. The house contains many of its original features including cornicing and sliding sash windows, and has a small, enclosed yard at the rear.
No 67 is situated on the western side of Mountjoy Square close to its junction with Gardiner Place. Mountjoy Square is one of five Georgian squares in Dublin, it was planned and developed in the late 18th century by Luke Gardiner, the 1st Viscount Mountjoy.
It was surrounded on all sides by terraced, red-brick Georgian houses.
The square is close to the centre of Dublin City and is served by almost ten frequent Dublin Bus routes and is within a short walk of the newly extended Luas line linking the north and south of the city.
The passing rent of €104,760 is relatively low with market rent estimated to be in the region of €137,520 per annum.

Highlight: Mountainstown House, a Georgian mansion which sits 120 acres of paddocks, fields and woodlands outside Navan, is on the market for the first time in 250 years 
Body


There are few surviving Irish properties that can claim as long a proprietorship as Mountainstown House in Co Meath. The 18th-century residence is the historic seat of the Pollock family, who have been stationed here for some two and a half centuries. Originally built for Samuel Gibbons, the Queen Anne-style house was subsequently sold to John Pollock, a solicitor and agent for the Marquess of Downshire, who had been renting the estate.
Pollock, who also maintained a residence on Mountjoy Square in Dublin, was “a determined and intelligent supporter of the Protestant ascendancy”, partaking in “the secret war against the United Irishmen” during the 1790s, according to the historian Thomas Bartlett. As clerk of the crown for Leinster, he also amassed considerable earnings, allowing him to add a two-storey wing to the rear of his country house, and a kitchen extension to the side.
Mountainstown today remains in the hands of that same clan, having been inherited by Arthur and Atalanta Pollock in 2004. The family have since rewired, replumbed and reroofed the property, created a sunken patio garden, and planted many new trees and flowers. With the couple looking to downsize, the house was placed on the market back in 2015 for €4.15 million. The asking price was cut a year later to €3.5 million and has now been revised down again to the current figure of €2.75 million.
Sitting on 120 acres of paddocks, fields and woodlands outside Navan, Mountainstown is approached by an avenue that passes through parkland before reaching a gravel forecourt with space for several cars. The house covers three floors over basement, extending to a whopping 1,103 square metres, according to selling agent Savills. Its grounds also hold a two-storey Georgian cottage, which has had a new roof and windows installed in recent years.
Stone steps flanked by balustrades lead up to the front entrance of the main residence, behind which is an elegant hall with ceiling details including, unusually, a mould of original owner Samuel Gibbons’ face. To the left are four interconnecting reception rooms with south-facing aspects. The library features gilded carvings of the Pollock family crest, depicting an arrow piercing a boar, and an original oxblood-coloured leather wall covering. Three bay windows are the focal point in the drawing room, which has garden access through double french doors. A large and small dining room are also found on this side of the house.
To the right of the main entrance is a study, playroom and kitchen with a shelved pantry. A more modern space, the kitchen has a central island, oil-fired Aga cooker, integrated Neff appliances and Scavolini units, plus a big skylight. The back hall provides access to a laundry room and linen room. The basement holds another fitted kitchen, as well a gym, billiard room and sitting room leading out into the sunken garden. There are several more entertainment rooms on this level, including a vaulted former servants’ hall, as well as two wine cellars.
On the first floor are seven bedrooms, four en suites and a main bathroom with a roll-top bath. The master bedroom has large south-facing bay windows overlooking the formal gardens. Three more bedrooms are located on the second level, along with a sitting room, bathroom and separate WC.
The formal gardens outside make a centrepiece of a sundial commissioned by John Pollock. The grounds also hold a variety of outbuildings, including a yard with an old cobbled carriage washing area, stone-built barn, stables and tack rooms. A stone well on the site remains in working order, according to the selling agent, Savills.
Mountainstown House is within walking distance of the small village of Castletown-Kilpatrick, and about a 15-minute drive from Navan. Dublin Airport is just over 60 kilometres away. Local amenities include the Navan Racecourse, Castletown Pitch and Putt Club, and Royal Tara Golf Club, and there are a number of hunting packs and shoots in the area.
The nearby River Boyne and its tributaries are good for fishing of salmon, eel and wild brown and rainbow trout. Trout fishing is also available on the lakes near Fore and Collinstown. For more details, contact Savills at 01-6634300.

A high-flying feminist call to arms, but also a flawed drama

I See You
By Amy de Bhrún
Theatre Upstairs @ Lanigan’s Bar, Eden Quay, Dublin
Rating: ***
Runs until May 26
Any play that begins with its author and co-lead actor handing you a lemon sherbet is obviously beyond criticism. “Do not be fooled by my glamorous exterior,” declares Lady Mary Heath (Amy de Bhrún) after she has passed her bag of boiled sweets around the theatre, “for my skills are by no means inferior.” What follows is a passionate plea for female self-empowerment, delivered with tremendous energy and conviction, but also sorely lacking in dramatic tension.
The real-life Lady Mary would certainly be flattered. Barely remembered today, this fearless Limerick-born aviator was world-famous in the 1920s as an Irish precursor of Amelia Earhart. Among her many achievements, she successfully lobbied for women’s athletics to be included in the Olympic Games, and became the first female to perform a parachute jump and the first person of either gender to fly solo from South Africa to London.
Although Lady Mary celebrated her femininity by wearing fur coats and high heels in the sky, she was also a victim of what we would call “toxic masculinity”. As a baby she saw her father beat her mother to death, while later in life the International Commission for Aviation labelled her menstrual cycles a “disability”. She was physically abused by the first of her three husbands, developed a serious drink problem and died aged 42 after falling downstairs on a London tram.
Lady Mary’s turbulent biography would clearly make for an interesting play in itself. Instead, de Bhrún has written a rather creaky ghost story in which the late thrill-seeker sends supportive messages to her 21st-century fictional namesake. Modern Mary (Roxanna Nic Liam) has no great claim to fame, but she is struggling with the twin challenges of an unplanned pregnancy and a violent partner who seems intent on breaking her spirit.
The plot unfolds through alternating monologues, occasionally broken up by the two women delivering earnest poetic raps in unison. “I am a queen lost in the walls of history,” runs one typical example, “destined for this misery, the lonely ladies’ club of those left behind.” De Bhrún’s underlying point is that female oppression goes in cycles, and young girls today deserve better role models than the ones served up by our trashy celebrity culture.
It’s a noble endeavour with one major flaw. Modern Mary’s predicament is simply too generic and lacking in colour, which means that her anguished speeches fail to make the emotional impact they should. Nor does director Helena Browne add much in the way of eye-catching stagecraft, apart from one neat touch of having Lady Mary scribble her communications on paper aeroplanes dangling from the ceiling
As a traditional drama, I See You struggles to achieve any real altitude. As a feminist call to arms, however, it pulsates with righteous anger – and deserves praise for giving a voice to people who have been silenced for far too long already.

“A Hamlet for our times.” This was the bold claim of director Yaël Farber last Monday when announcing that Oscar-nominated Irish actor Ruth Negga will play the great Dane in next September’s Dublin Theatre Festival.
An even more radical take on Shakespeare’s iconic tragedy, meanwhile, can be seen at the Abbey Theatre next week. First performed in 2010, The Rehearsal: Playing the Dane is the brainchild of experimental theatre company Pan Pan and based on the postmodernist idea that “what we play is more important than what we are”.
Just like Hamlet itself, this show also contains a play within a play. It begins with three thespians auditioning for the central role, exposing the indignities of their profession and giving new meaning to the line “To be or not to be.” After audience members have made their choice, the successful candidate will spearhead a production that promises to “not so much update or deconstruct the play as explode it”.
Directed by Gavin Quinn, The Rehearsal: Playing The Dane runs at the Abbey Theatre, May 23-26.

Body


History books in time will look very unfavourably upon the 2011 decision to disband the board of the HSE.
As the national health system faces an existential crisis with public confidence at its lowest ebb in decades, it is clear that this decision has impacted on the ability of the HSE to deliver an effective service in a structure where accountability, performance and the highest standard of ethics are the norm.
Since 2011, the reporting of the HSE chief executive and executive team to the Minister for Health, Department of Health and the Dáil health sub-committee, has been a poor substitute for a proper board of directors.
While the outgoing chief executive and executive team need to accept their fair share of responsibility for the crises, scandals and poor performance of the organisation, I believe they missed the support of a strong board, bringing consistent independent oversight, to help address challenges like A&E overcrowding.
A fundamental recommendation in the recent Sláintecare report was the re-establishment of a HSE Board.
The board will need to create an ethical and patient-centric culture and underpinned by its own performance. Modern, progressive boards act as high-performing teams, where independent non-executive directors partner with chief executives and executive teams.
The new HSE board should comprise outstanding non- executive directors drawn from:
•	The best and brightest minds in our broader Irish medical ecosystem, who have a deep understanding of the Irish health system. Whether this experience is in a private hospital, the Department of Health, or GP/consultancy, is a secondary matter.
What is critical here is that the board must have a subset of members who have a genuine understanding of how we have arrived at this point. Open progressive mindsets and a deep commitment to challenge the status quo and bring their own independent thinking to the table, is crucial.
•	Private sector heavyweights with proven executive experience. In particular, those in organisations with complex service delivery chains, distributed teams and large transformational project delivery.
The HSE’s track record in adopting modern technology to streamline information management and service delivery processes has been poor.
•	International leaders from other national health systems who could bring valuable independent views of best practices in other national health systems.
•	A strong non-executive board member who will have a patient advocacy role in addition to making a strong overall contribution at the board table.
The Public Appointments Service will have a pivotal role in identifying candidates for the new HSE board, who have the intellectual firepower, organisational and executive track record, skillset, courage and commitment needed.
This is absolutely not the time to play it safe. We need a board which will rise to the enormous challenge of turning around a broken ship, which will not hesitate to make the tough decisions and which will work with the new chief executive and existing executive team to stabilise and build the foundation for sustainable improvement in the HSE performance over the coming years.
The selection of the chair will be crucial. A critical first step for them will be to instil a new culture accountability across the organisation, beginning at chief executive and executive team level and to every employee and partner of the HSE.
The Cervical Check scandal demonstrated the acceptance of behaviours employed to protect the “integrity” of a dysfunctional system.
Excellence is not the default position of a board of directors. Outstanding boards are forged from:
•	a high-calibre chair setting a high bar for board effectiveness and performance;
•	diverse non-executive directors bringing challenge, oversight and strategic thinking to the board;
•	a chief executive and executive team engaging in a highly open and accountable manner, all integrated into a genuine board team with a passionate commitment to excel on behalf of shareholders and stakeholders.
This is a time for real leadership, fundamental transformation and the commitment needed to underpin the efficient patient-centric health service our citizens deserve.

A rich legacy of female innovation

Highlight: It is thanks to a young 19th-century French widow that Champagne was developed into the world-class, sparkling drink that it is today 
Body


The impact of a long line of brilliant female owners and innovators in Champagne made it a beacon of enlightened business practice and anti-patriarchal thinking in the wine world, and beyond.
The pioneering women in Champagne not only broke moulds and social norms, they also invented vital new techniques, pioneered new creations and completely altered the path of the business of wine.
From Louise Pommery of Champagne Pommery who gave the world the Brut, dry style at the end of the 1890s, to Sophie Larmandier of Champagne Larmandier-Bernier today advancing biodynamic and sustainable production, it is a story that continues.
But the single greatest innovator probably remains Madame Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin, who took the control of the Champagne house, later called Champagne Veuve, or widow, Clicquot from her recently deceased husband, François Clicquot.
The year was 1805, and women were all but excluded from both property ownership and business. Across Europe, women were excluded from banking, taking out loans, entering into binding contracts and on marriage a women effectively lost all property rights to her husband. One tiny exception in France at that time was widowhood, where the widow could assume the helm of her husband’s business.
Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin was just 27 when her husband died in 1805. She would go on to run the Champagne house for 62 years. During that time, she did not simply own the Champagne house: she built it from a tiny peripheral company into one of the largest and most important Champagne houses in the world.
Perhaps most importantly, Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin developed a systematic and successful method of making Champagne appear crystal clear in colour. Without her breakthrough, Champagne today would be as it was in the 18th century: quite opaque, like cloudy apple juice.
Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin displayed brilliance at a macro and a micro level. While evolving new markets in the US and Russia, she worked hard on the problem of making Champagne better to look at, more like the pure brilliant colours of Burgundy than a sparkling cloudy apple juice.
Cloudy Champagne occurs because the cloud, called lees, which is a mix of yeast, grape skin and grape pulp, is added into the base wine for Champagne, which is still. The yeasty lees starts a fermentation in the sealed bottle creating a by-product, CO2 gas. The gas cannot escape and so becomes infused in the wine, making the wine effervescent, giving us the bubbles we love.
[caption id="attachment_416636" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Madame Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin[/caption]
The dead yeast and skins deteriorate further, giving a toasty, creamy, bready taste to the best of Champagnes. Unfortunately, after this and a process called autolysis, the cloudy material is still inside the bottle.
Madame Clicquot worked on this problem and eventually evolved a solution. She had angled holes cut in a kitchen table and put the bottle necks down in the holes, gently agitating them every few days until eventually the wine cleared and the detritus of skins and yeast was now all in top of the bottle neck.
She then froze the plug of icy waste. On opening the bottle, the icy waste shot out; a new cork and some top-up liquid were quickly inserted; and clear, sparkling Champagne was created.
It may seem obvious and simple today, but two centuries of (male) owners had not figured out how to do this successfully. Madame Clicquot’s basic idea is still used today.
In 1818, the 40-year-old Madame Clicquot had become a devotee of one of the rarities of Champagne, red still wine from around the village of Bouzy. Ever-restless, Madame Clicquot began experimental blending of red Bouzy to her Champagne, bringing a suitably gorgeous colour and a little berry complexity to the palate. Today, most Champagne rosé wines are still made in blending this way, and rosé Champagne is the most expensive wine the Champagne producer makes. Another gift of Madame Clicquot, which this year marks its 200th anniversary.
Having made the innovations of dazzling clear Champagnes and established loyal and wealthy overseas markets, Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin was not about to let imposters steal her work. From 1811 onwards, she had the corks in her bottles marked with a star, for Halley’s Comet, and her initials, VCP. Famously, she also had a clear yellow coloured label pasted on every bottle. Again, no one else was doing this kind of branding effectively at the time.

Artist’s collaboration with Mother Nature

Highlight: TJ Maher gave up painting for two decades to create a gorgeous haven for people, plants and pollinators 
Body


As a child, painter TJ Maher spent his days wandering the fields and fishing near his home in Golden, Co Tipperary. This instilled in him a love of nature that is clear to see in his Co Wicklow garden, Patthana.
Patthana, he tells me, is a term he came across in a book on meditation meaning ‘to be present’. It was his partner Simon’s mum who found the house for them, in the quiet village of Kiltegan, and encouraged them to buy it. About an hour from Dublin, Patthana is a haven for people, plants and pollinators as well as all other types of wildlife.
“Some people just love flowers; for me it’s more than that. The whole purpose of a flower is to attract a pollinator. Without the insects and the birds I wouldn’t really have an interest in the plants on their own. I love looking at them and seeing what insect is on what plant; it’s the interconnection between the plants and animals that I love.”
But he also wants the garden to be pleasing to the eye. As an artist he is drawn to colour and shapes. Most of the planting consists of spikes and umbels, not heavy blocks of planting. Colour is visually very stimulating but Maher also likes muted, quiet areas where the eye can rest.
[caption id="attachment_416758" align="alignright" width="512"] TJ Maher in Patthana garden[/caption]
In a small garden the plants should be carefully chosen for maximum effect. “You want colour for as long as possible. I grow a lot of plants that flower for a very long season, such as plants that are sterile and don’t produce seed so they just keep on flowering.” Geum ‘Totally Tangerine’ is an example of one of these sterile plants that flowers for months on end. He also grows many colourful summer flowering plants like dahlias, cosmos, Nicotiana and Salvia (sages) and adds to them with foliage plants such as Canna, Plectranthus and coleus.
On entering the garden you are welcomed into a small stone-walled courtyard with planting in greens, creams and whites. A group of elegant white ‘Tres Chic’ tulips divides wooden lounge chairs from the entrance area. Hardy geraniums, Salvia, Dutch iris and Plectranthus argentatus will take over here when the tulips have finished.
In the corner is the excellent maple Acer aconitifolium which has spectacular colour in the autumn, and a Fatsia polycarpa underplanted with a hairy leaved Bergenia and white Ranunculus. Prunus ‘Kojo-no-mai’ (dwarf flowering cherry), a white bleeding heart and Saxifraga Kinky which has purple tinges to the leaves, fill another corner here while white foxgloves, ferns and pots of hostas, spider plants and Hakonechloa brighten up the shady meditation area. From the patio, two sets of steps lead up to a lawn through beds burgeoning with all sorts of plants punctuated with tulips.
The lawn reflects the curve of the perimeter of the garden. Maher didn’t want to break it up by running a path across it so the solution was a set of granite pavers, inspired by the keys of a piano, along one side. The stone relates nicely to the cut granite stone of the house. The island bed appeared after he ran out of planting space, but when it fills with plants in the summer it gives the impression of being a continuous part of the border behind.
Plants that are good for pollinators are also high on the list of top plants in this garden: Eupatorium, Veronicastrum, Sanguisorba ‘Lilac Squirrel’, Achillea Terracotta, verbascums, heleniums, single dahlias, Knautia macedonica, Thalictrum ‘Splendide’, Verbena bonariensis, Helenium ‘Moerheim Beauty’, and sedums for the butterflies. In the furthest corner of the garden, there is a bench surrounded by ferns and clouds of pink cow parsley with hellebores, alliums, Geranium palmatum, and the amazing dark red lily, ‘Claude Shride’.
Maher is attracted to all things Mediterranean such as olives but in this corner of Wicklow it’s too cold for them. He does however have a 14-year-old Mediterranean tortoise living in the garden during the summer (which hibernates in a shoebox in the fridge during the winter months).
In a small garden, the choice of trees and shrubs is critical. Trees are chosen for a long season of interest: scent, flowers, berries and colour. CercidIphyllum ‘Heronswood Globe’, one of Maher’s favourites, is a dwarf tree with lovely coppery foliage in spring and good autumn colour. A native Euonymus with its pink seed capsules with orange seeds is another favourite. There is a row of Sorbus down one side of the garden and young Kalopanax are chosen for their fingered leaves that stand out against the sky.
Maher took a 20-year break from painting while renovating the house and working on the garden but started painting again five years ago. “Art is a head thing; gardening is very tactile,” he said. “Painting is much more of an inner journey, it can be very intense. I go to the studio in the morning and I garden in the afternoon. Gardening is a lovely grounding experience – it’s lovely coming out of my head after painting. Since I started painting again I’m looking at the garden more critically.”
He says opening the gardening to the public pushes him creatively as he had to get it up to a certain level. But it is a challenge he loves.
“People race around the garden and they come back and I always say to them ‘Go and do it all again’, and they always see something they didn’t see the first time and are amazed by that. A lot of gardens don’t have enough seating; that’s important to me here. If you sit down, you’re in a different zone, on a different time scale. You are stationary like the plants and you get to see more. People are going all the time, moving and on their phone and flying through images all the time. It’s important to stop.”
Patthana garden is open every Sunday until the first Sunday in October from 12pm to 6pm. Entry is €5. Open to groups by appointment at other times. See facebook.com/Patthanagardenkiltegan/

A well-presented, three-bedroom home of 140 square metres in walk-in condition (with a Foxrock address), 20 Brighton Court in Dublin 18 is bound to attract high interest. Family buyers will also particularly appreciate the south-facing garden.
On the market at €825,000 with Sherry FitzGerald, the pretty terraced home on a cul-de-sac in a quiet residential enclave overlooks a green area and Carrickmines lawn tennis club and has been tastefully decorated throughout.
Laid over three levels, it has a bright hall, a living room to the front with fitted storage, timber floors, a modern fireplace and overlooks the green through a bay window.
At the rear of the hall is a contemporary Newcastle Design white kitchen, with a Miller Brothers white veined marble countertop and integrated appliances, including a Britannia gas range and access to a utility room at the rear. The kitchen/dining room spans the width of the property and opens to the south facing garden. A guest WC and understairs storage complete the ground floor space. On the first floor is a family room with full height windows overlooking the communal green. The master bedroom is also at this level and has built-in wardrobes and a modern shower room. There are two more double bedrooms and a family bathroom at second floor level. All of the bedrooms have fitted, louvred shutters.
Outside, the private rear garden has an Indian sandstone patio area bordered by flower beds with gravel steps leading to a New England styled garden room which has multiple uses. There’s off-street parking at the front of the house.
Foxrock and Cabinteely Villages are both close by and have bijou shops and trendy eateries. The N11 with QBC, Air Coach and M50 are convenient, as is the Luas. The area is host to a choice of prestigious schools, sports clubs and facilities and recreational amenities.

Charting the boom in flexible office space

Savills Ireland has released a report about a new trend in work spaces, revealing a growing uptake in the flexible officer sector in Ireland. According to the agent, some 12,446 square metres of flexible office space have been taken so far in 2018.
Workthere, Savills’ venture which finds businesses flexible, co-working office spaces across Europe, has seen demand almost double since its inception in 2017, according to the agent.
“The serviced office market has grown dramatically since Workthere’s launch in 2017, with new business centres opening in Dublin almost every month,” said Michael Healy, head of occupier services at Savills Ireland.
Healy has tripled the size of his team at Savills to service growing demand. Last month he appointed Georgina Dillon to spearhead the operation in Dublin. Dillon previously managed the Marylebone sales team of London-based property firm Marsh and Parsons.
“Georgina’s arrival as lead agent for Workthere has come at an important juncture in the business’ evolution,” said Healy.
Sam Daunt is another to have been lured to the Savills Tenant Representation team. He has a wealth of experience advising office tenants at the Cork branch of Savills, where he worked for years.
According to Healy, more and more office tenants are choosing to use flexible office space over traditional offices. In many instances, a serviced office solution is preferable – especially if a company needs to scale up or down quickly without having to sign up to medium or long-term leases – until they know their headcount projections.
Serviced offices can be attractive to businesses looking for an intermediate solution while taking their time finding a permanent office.
They are also used as a medium-term provision avoiding up-front tenant fit-out costs and maintaining flexibility. Most service office licences can be terminated by the tenant with only one-to-three months’ notice.
Typically, hot desks in the flexible office sector range from €350 to €595 per month for full package memberships.

Coming-of-age tale has a dash of 1980s nostalgia

FICTION: The Night of the Party, By Rachael English Hachette Books Ireland, €17.50
When she’s not presenting Ireland’s most popular radio show, Morning Ireland, Rachael English somehow finds the time to pen the kind of page-turning novels that made Maeve Binchy a household name. The Night of the Party is her fourth book and, right from the off, it grabs the reader by the lapels and refuses to let go, with the shocking discovery of a dead body in a small west of Ireland town during the legendary big snow of January 1982.
The action begins in the fictional east Clare village of Kilmitten, with the Crossan family planning their annual knees-up, where the entire village descends on their ramshackle house to banish the January blues in a haze of booze and fags. While the adults are busy inside, 12-year-old Tom Crossan is hatching a plan, involving his best friend Conor, two brown bottles of Harp, cigarettes, matches and two local girls, doctor’s daughter Nina and the wild and worldly Tess, in the garden shed.
When the underage drinkers run out of hooch, Tom offers to sneak into the house to get more, but instead of illicit alcohol, he encounters the prone body of the local parish priest, Father Galvin, and spots one of the villagers exiting stage left as fast as their legs will carry them. Instead of raising the alarm, the stricken boy returns to his friends, pretending nothing has happened. Tom remains tight-lipped for the following 34 years, a decision that will haunt all four throughout their lives, as the search for the priest’s killer continues to make headlines across the decades, including a 1992 documentary that ruffles more than a few feathers.
The Ireland of the 1980s is depicted as “thin, troubled and shrouded in a fog of cigarette smoke”, and Kilmitten is a haven of brilliant characters, from the local hairdresser who “insisted on doing a shampoo and set like it was 1962” to the small town gossips who inhabit the grey town.
English’s descriptions tread a lovely balance between worldly and colloquial, whether explaining how the teenage Conor was “a long skinnymalinks of a fellow”, noting how Tom’s worry-wart mother was “an expert in things going wrong”, or the way the old men congregated in one corner of the pub, “huddled like sheep against a storm”.
We follow Tom, Conor, Nina and Tess as they move away from Kilmitten, fall in love, make mistakes, fall out and eventually grow up, from London of the late 1980s through 1990s Dublin, where Sides and the Pink Elephant were the epitome of cool, and through to the post-recession Ireland of 2016, complete with gangland feuds and political scandals.
The four main characters are both readable and believable as their lives veer off in vastly different directions, from primary school teaching to the catwalks of Paris. Tom is the least rounded of the principals, and seems to veer from moody adolescent to successful politician in a few short heartbeats, but in the main, English’s characters are defiantly real, from Tess’s refusal to change her accent (“Prince ‘Willum’ was second in line to the throne”) to Nina’s calm realisation that her marriage is disintegrating.
Ireland changes alongside the four teenagers, from the “toora-loora-loora, pigs in the kitchen” country at the start of the novel, through the heady days of the Celtic Tiger, “when the country had been devoured by notions”, and out the far side of austerity and belt-tightening. Indeed, English’s dissection of the disaffected “glassy-eyed, mossy-teethed Irish men” propping up a London bar and dreaming of an Ireland that only existed in their imaginations is note-perfect.
She even manages a few wry digs at her own line of work in the day job, whether assessing the politician “adept at answering questions that hadn’t been asked and ignoring the ones that had”, lampooning the local TD who drives around with spare wreaths in the back of the car in case he comes across a funeral, or asserting that “dealing with real people was altogether more challenging than dealing with journalists”.
It’s part country whodunnit, with enough skeletons in its closet for an Agatha Christie double-bill, but mostly, The Night of the Party is a coming of age novel that will be instantly recognisable to anyone who grew up in 1980s or 1990s Ireland, making it great fun and ideal fodder for the beach.

Joint agents Brock Delappe and Alliance Auctioneers are handling the launch and sale of 12 two and three-bedroom townhouses and bungalows on the grounds of the restored Oatlands House, Castleknock, Dublin next weekend.
Set on a site of almost ten acres, the houses on offer occupy the restored stables and outbuildings to the north west of, and adjoining, the main house, which dates to the 1790s. The converted units extend to between about 83 and 152 square metres, and are priced from €460,000 to €640,000.
Marrying the benefits of period characteristics with modern conveniences, the homes at Oatlands boast high ceilings and large period windows with views over the Strawberry Beds, as well as bespoke Fitzgerald kitchens, tiled bathrooms and fitted wardrobes, selected by interior designers, House & Garden ~ Furnishings.
The landscaped grounds within the scheme feature private gardens, communal courtyards and meandering walkways through mature fruit gardens.
A protected structure, Oatlands House has had a colourful and varied heritage of occupants, including landed gentry in the guise of the Godley family and a series of senior British army personnel, including one Colonel Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain – an army officer and later Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabulary. He resigned in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, and is credited with having invented snooker while serving the crown in India in 1875.
The house was later occupied by a German hotelier family, a vet, a racehorse trainer and the Guinness family, creating the great Liffey side estates which started with Farmleigh and ran west to Luttrellstown Estate.
Oatlands is situated on and is accessed directly off the Porterstown Road, immediately adjacent to Castleknock GAA grounds and about 400 metres from Castleknock Golf Club.

Company: Metabolomic Diagnostics
Done Deal: €2 million EU funding
The clincher: “We plan to market the product next year, and with this support from EU, we believe that PrePsia has the potential to become part of pregnancy screening programmes worldwide” - Charles Garvey, chief executive, Metabolomic Diagnostics
Biotech start-up Metabolomic Diagnostics has secured €2 million in EU funding under the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument.
The Cork company is developing a blood test, which can be administered in the early stages of pregnancy, to determine if women may be at risk of developing preterm preeclampsia. Its PrePsia test evolved from UCC research into metabolomic biomarkers.
Metabolomic Diagnostics is one of three Irish companies awarded EU funding in the latest Horizon 2020 SME Instrument round, which received 1,280 applications from around Europe. Ireland’s Metabolomic Diagnostics, AuriGen Medical and Atxa Therapeutics were among 64 projects granted €110 million in this round. The three companies secured a combined €7 million in EU funding.
Metabolomic Diagnostics is led by Charles Garvey, Paul Hands and Diarmuid Cahalane. Established in 2011, the company has already raised €1.5 million over two rounds from investors including SOSventures Ireland Fund, AIB Seed Capital Fund and Enterprise Ireland.
Garvey has led several tech start-ups to exit, including Horizon Technology Group, which floated on the London and Dublin stock markets at a valuation of £90 million, and was acquired by Avnet.
Hands established Qumas in 1994. The quality management software firm sold to US medical software company Accelrys for US$50 million.
Garvey said Metamobolic’s PrePsia test had the potential to transform prenatal care by allowing clinicians to administer treatments early, thereby improving pregnancy outcomes, while lowering the healthcare costs associated with treating the disease.
“We plan to market the product next year, and now with this support from EU, we believe that PrePsia has the potential to become part of pregnancy screening programmes worldwide,” said Garvey.
“This award will be used to accelerate our go-to-market strategy. The award is recognition by the European Union of the huge progress we have made to date and the enormous societal benefit that our innovative test will bring to expectant mothers and their babies all over the world.”
Irish companies have acquired almost €62 million to date through the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument which aims to support SMEs with new ideas and ambitions to scale internationally.
Since the programme’s 2014 inception, Ireland has secured more than €513 million through Horizon 2020.

Don’t turn a health crisis into a financial crisis

Highlight: We think nothing of paying for monthly protection cover on our smartphones, so maybe it’s time we did the same for life protection, writes Paul Merriman 
Body


What we do in the protection industry is important. Protection is sometimes forgotten by us all. Nobody likes to think of illness or mortality and so protection is subsequently thought of less and less, as pensions, mortgages, car and home insurance all compete for our limited financial-related attention spans.
And so we, at ClearChoice, launched this, the inaugural Protection Summit for the Financial Brokerage/Life Assurance industry to highlight the importance of what the protection industry does for families, businesses and individuals. And we are striving to improve coverage in some key areas. We feel it’s crucially important that we remind the protection industry of its key function in society – as the front line of any financial planning exercise.
It’s also an opportunity to ask the important questions. Like how do we prioritise where our monthly financial direct debits go? In all likelihood, for most Irish families, mortgage or rent payments take priority followed by the usual list of payouts such as car insurance, home and contents insurance, mortgage protection, health insurance, extra life cover, pet insurance and so on.
The average life sum insured on death that is paid out hovers between €60,000-€70,000 on average in any given year, according to life company statistics in Ireland. The adviser’s obligation is to insure against risk, yet in middle Ireland, the average salary for a family unit goes from €40,000 up to possibly €100,000 (if a strong single-earner or dual-income family). This average life insurance payout is not commensurate to the exposure a family has with the loss of an income earner. The loss of a homemaker would also be detrimental, with childcare supports, shortened working hours for a surviving spouse all taking their toll, mentally, physically and financially.
We, as a society, are more likely to purchase protection for a smartphone than we are to protect our most important asset – our income.
To explain further, let’s take, for example, a 40-year-old, working until the age of 68 on a €50,000-a-year salary. He or she will earn a total of €1.4 million over 28 years (not allowing for inflation or wage growth, which we would normally assume to happen). The cost to protect 75 per cent of this income as a non-smoker male would be €52.21 a month. Yet many may spend €15 a month insuring an €800 smartphone.
There is gross under provision for specified serious illness cover to protect against heart attacks, cancer, stroke etc and income protection in the long term should a person be unable to work indefinitely. How would our 40-year-old fare if illness or injury meant they couldn’t earn? The fallout could be severe, highlighting the need for protection.
Its a problem we in Ireland are slowly waking up to.
And despite the fact that we have a thriving pharma and IT industry in Ireland, we are still a nation of SMEs.
Why is this important? Well, there are 248,344 SME firms in Ireland, yet we are drastically under insured for business protection, income protection and specified serious illness cover. Key people run these businesses with little or no protection, particularly where a situation can become complicated with a spouse or family member stepping into a business. What would you do in these situations?
Not many could answer this. The answer is to seek advice from a financial broker. Many of these products can be paid through a business. There is also tax relief related to income protection – one of the last reliefs left standing with the Revenue Commissioners.
We can’t forget that the protracted economic recession left many of us lapsing direct debits on an increasingly frequent basis. While income may have stopped coming in, the bills still had be paid on time. That’s a very stressful situation for any individual or family to find themselves in. And so it is important to provide adequate protection for you, your family and your business should the unthinkable happen.
We were pleased to have Professor John Crown, the Oncologist of St Vincent’s hospital, who gave the financial adviser audience key insights into cancer trends and the issues impacting our health system, particularly those that have come to light in recent weeks.
Finally, we would like to thank the two important charities invited to our Protection Summit. The Marie Keating Foundation and Early Childhood Cancer Charity spoke to our financial adviser audience to highlight the key protections that these financial products can give.
The last thing any person needs during a bereavement or health crisis is a financial crisis.

As he prepared to have the conversation that would either secure his fledgling business or finish it off, his thoughts turned to his inspirational late father, a prominent figure in Irish business who had always known what to do in make-or-break situations like this

Following in Dad’s footsteps
I arrived outside the building in Manhattan for the final meeting that I was ever going to have about the platform I had built. I had identified the company via LinkedIn, of all places, and sent them a hit-and-hope message a few weeks earlier. They had agreed to meet, but I had managed to forget about it in the time since. We had had so little luck in drumming up interest in our other fund raising/acquisition meetings that I held virtually no hope for a positive outcome from this last one.
I was resigned to the fact that my eight-year adventure had come to an end. I already had the email drafted that I was going to send to our personnel around the world announcing it was the end. My plan was to send it at 5.30pm that day, and that would be that. I had also booked a flight to take me home to Dublin, where I had given my mum forewarning to prepare the sofa for the return of her son.
I met my sidekick outside the building, and we went inside. In the lift heading up to the third floor, time seemed to move at a different pace. My mind turned to my father, and what he would do in such circumstances.
To rewind about a year, my father died three months after I had moved to New York. He was just 49 years of age. He was one of the most brilliant men you would ever have the good fortune to meet.
Dad’s story defined the rise and fall of the Celtic Tiger. In his early twenties in 1980s Ireland, when most were emigrating, he saw opportunity, attempting a variety of colourful and zany business ideas. Everything he did was just a bit leftfield. I certainly took from him in that sense. Nothing was really by the book. His real success came at the turn of the 1990s, when he was just 27.
He was an instrumental figure in redefining Dublin for the decade ahead and beyond. In the ten years that followed, everything he touched appeared to turn to gold. He injected a positive creativity into all he put his mind to and the people loved it. He was a maverick in his approach to his endeavours.
Dad was sharp as a whistle. He could see through bullshit. In fact, that was a common line whenever I tried to pull the wool over his eyes. “You can’t bullshit a bullshitter,” he would say.
He had impeccable taste. He knew what the people wanted before they knew they wanted it. People flocked in their masses to his businesses, with queues often forming around the block to see his latest creations. But he was not content in his field of business. He hated being defined. In the years of his real success, he tried to break out of his box with a number of more outlandish ideas.
Before anyone had mentioned it, Dad identified Dublin as a digital hub and took a huge interest in virtual reality. This was in the early 1990s. More eccentrically, he got the ball rolling on the idea of bringing Wimbledon FC to Dublin before everyone else jumped on that bandwagon. Dad also invested in a TV station that would show Irish and British TV programming around the world. In the days before digital television, it was simply ahead of its time.
Dad’s restless mind led him to having a breakdown when he was at the peak of his powers in 2000. He was just 37. At the time, he had been having ideas about restructuring the stock market to allow money to flow to the world’s poorest people. It might sound off the wall, but most believed in his vision. People followed his lead. He had his initial breakdown in advance of having a meeting with Bono, when he was excited about explaining his grand vision for restructuring the world’s economic flow.
Dad’s breakdown caused a major shock to his system and, for the remainder of his life, he struggled hugely with his mental health. He began to look for the answers to life’s biggest questions - seeking wisdom from psychologists, faith healers and charlatan gurus whom I felt took advantage of his sensitivity. He was in and out of psychiatric care in Dublin, which I also felt wasn’t the greatest help.
Despite the mental upheaval, in Dad’s final ten years he continued with wilder and wilder endeavours as his mind expanded. He wanted to create a major positive change in the world around him, taking great interest in concepts like global warming and peak oil. Dad also supported innumerable Irish start-ups, giving both financial support and office space.
People who met Dad in these years met a fascinating, soulful man, but most were unaware of the internal struggles he faced on a daily basis. To be honest, Dad deserves a book of his own. I’m doing him scant justice here.
When the financial crash came in 2007, the banks came squarely after my father, and he was publicly and personally ruined. He was at his most delicate at the time the world fell upon him. He had done more in his life than most could dream of. But now he was done. He was crushed. The energy for life’s day-to-day fight had left him. He had lost his spirit. He barely left the house in the last couple of years, hiding as he continued to struggle with his demons.
One day, my brother phoned me to tell me that Dad had died. Though obviously deeply upsetting, it wasn’t the biggest surprise to me. Life had become torture to him, and part of me took some solace in the fact that he could now rest.
His funeral was attended by a who’s who of personalities, many of whom had been helped and supported by him along the way. If only he had known how much he was loved and appreciated in his time.
Dad was a huge supporter of me. He gave me a personal freedom to pursue whatever dreams I wanted to. When I had wanted to go to film school earlier in life, he simply said: “Just make sure it’s what you really want to do, and give it your all. I’m happy to support you.”
I never wanted to let him down, and I made a success out of my stints in film school by making an acclaimed short film.
When I started my platform, Dad supported it from the outset and would give me his outside-the-box wisdom about how to handle every situation.
Returning to the lift when I was heading to my last-ever meeting, I considered what Dad might do in the meeting. What type of words would he use? My father, in his time, was brilliant when it came to pulling such situations out of the fire, when all hope seemed lost. He could uniquely spin a negative situation into a positive.
Without getting too morbid about it, I decided to go full Dad, channel his energy and try and save the day in the last meeting. I had nothing to lose now. I might as well go down all guns blazing, I thought.
The lift doors opened.
The building was located in the hippest part of Manhattan. My sidekick and I followed the secretary through the cool, open-plan workspace, over to the corner office, where we were met by the chief executive and the executive chairman.
The secretary asked if I wanted a glass of water. I needed two, having only slept a couple of hours and with a hangover raging through my body.
The chief executive was in his early forties, clean-cut and with an intimidating face. If I can’t read someone, I get intimidated. The stocky chairman gave off a much warmer vibe: you might imagine going for a beer with him.
After knocking back the water, my pulse racing, I explained with succinct passion what we had been up to the previous eight years. I had done that in other meetings, and it hadn’t necessarily got me anywhere - so now was the time I would have to add a new dimension for the last hurrah, channel my father, and pull it out of the fire. I leaned forward and made forceful eye contact with the executive. My hands were using pointed gestures. I was aggressive.
“Listen, this platform is fucking beautiful. I am immensely proud of it. But you must understand, the energy people put into it around the world is intangible. You can’t put it on a spreadsheet.”
I opened up some images to demonstrate this. I almost got misty-eyed looking at them myself. I decided to go for the jugular.
“If you had any wisdom, you would make this part of your company. I believe it is a natural fit and will bring you great PR. It’s a no brainer, in fact. I would do it, if I were you.”
I could have left it at that. But I didn’t.
“But to be honest, if you’re not interested I don’t give a fuck. This is the last meeting I am ever going to have on this. I am going to backpack around the world.”
Done. The last pitch I’d ever do for the platform that had defined my life for eight years. The executive chairman eyeballed me back.
“You seem like you’re still pretty passionate about this.”
“Of course I’m fucking passionate about it. This is my life. I’ve spent eight years at it. It’s fucking amazing. You should count yourself lucky that I just walked in this room and am giving you this opportunity.”
As I said, I was pushing it. The chairman tapped his pen on a pad, thinking quickly. I was expecting a line along the lines of: “That’s a great story. Sorry, we can’t do anything just now.” And we’d be on our way.
Instead, he said: “Okay, here is what we are going to do. We are going to pay off your previous investors, and you and your team are going to come work for us. We have over 150 personnel that will support you to continue building and take it to the next level. We will give you an executive salary.
“To be honest, I would employ you one way or the other, regardless of what you’ve built. What you’ve done, largely off your own steam, is incredible. Since you haven’t made any money out of this, I’m also going to give you $100,000. You are overdue for the work you have put in. ”
I was dumbstruck. Did I just hear what I heard? I never put myself down as a good salesman, and yet here was a life-saving deal which had taken just minutes. My mind thought quickly. Wait, if I was to do this deal I’m sure people around the world, and my remaining co-founder in Dublin would think that I had made millions out of it. I wouldn’t have, of course, but there would be no reason why this wouldn’t be the perception.
I needed to dig out a fund for our people around the world to negate that situation. Besides, I always vowed that if I ever did another deal for our company, I wouldn’t do it unless I got some reward for them.
“Okay, that all sounds amazing,” I replied. “I really appreciate the offer. But I will need a commitment of $150,000 extra per year that we want to invest in our people”
“You won’t need that,” said the chief executive’s sidekick. “They don’t need that.”
I thought again. Maybe he was right. Nah. I would.
“If you can commit to an extra $150k, I’ll shake your hand right now,” I said.
We looked at each other.
“Okay,” he responded reaching out his hand. I reached back and shook.
The whole meeting lasted about 20 minutes. As we went down in the lift my sidekick grabbed me by the shoulders.
“How did you do that?” he exclaimed. “You’ve never been like that in a meeting before.”
“Did I just do that?” I was shaking in disbelief. The adrenaline was pumping.
I got back to my apartment at 11am, mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted. I dropped my keys on the counter. My flatmate, who had listened to my stresses and anxieties for months, was there.
“I think I just did a deal. I think I saved it,” I said to her, before walking to my room, where I collapsed on the bed.
After getting some much-needed sleep, I called my co-founder back in Dublin to tell him the great news. I decided I would offer him $50,000 out of the $100,000 that had been offered to me by the new company. That might not sound like much to some of you, but it was a significant result considering what the alternative was going to be - the end.
“You can’t just sell the company like that,” he complained. “Keep working on it, you can find a better deal.”
I think he was hoping I would make him a millionaire through it all. I would have liked to, but that just wasn’t the way it was going to be.
He was distrusting me again. He probably thought I was making a packet out of it. In truth, I was getting a job out of it. There wouldn’t be a role for him. So, in that sense, I could understand him being upset. But I wasn’t getting rich either. The full-time job was my reward. And at this stage I desperately needed some job security combined with a dependable income.
“I have been looking for a deal,” I told him. “This is it. This is the deal. There is nothing else on the table.”
He wasn’t happy with me. But it was either doing this deal or it was game over. I was not prepared to go further with it. I wasn’t willing to hunt for a better deal while broke again. I’d done that for most of the last eight years.
I got little congratulations from the previous investors for creating what was essentially an successful acquisition for the company they invested in. Sure, the company hadn’t grown like they had wished, but an acquisition looks good for all involved. It was unbelievable, considering that they had refused to invest in a bridge round of funding, such was their lack of confidence in me. I think I deserved a pat on the back.
The moral of the story is that, sometimes, you just need to congratulate yourself, as often nobody else will. Love thyself. But, to be honest, it would have been nice to get a bit more love at that moment.
To add a bit more salt, the investors got wind of the $100,000 that was being offered to me, and demanded a slice of that pie. Can you believe that? It all seemed extremely petty to me.
In the end, I never saw any of that $100,000. My co-founder and investors got that loot, as I spent the next three months working with lawyers to get the acquisition deal over the line. The euphoria of the life-saving deal dissipated quickly in that time. All I wanted was to get in the door of the new parent company and to start building towards the future.

Highlight: GDPR throws up particular challenges for ERP systems, but businesses should avoid just throwing the latest technology at it as a quick-fix, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body


Enterprise resource planning solutions (ERPs) are in a constant state of flux so businesses must be thinking a step ahead to ensure they move with the times.
Having been around for quite a while, ERPs have evolved to cope with the times, incorporating elements like cloud and adapting to the smartphone age.
This is the case more than ever now as new technology features such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning come into play. Incorporating these into ERP practices will be the focus for many, but one significant challenge must first be overcome: one that’s been on everyone’s lips for the past 18 months.
“The first unavoidable change and challenge is GDPR,” said Alan Connor, commercial director for Exchequer Business Solutions. “Historically, ERPs are used to mine and retain data, holding on to everything just in case there’d be a benefit. Implementing system-wide procedures and technology solutions to provide [GDPR features like] right-to-be-forgotten reminders and to anonymise particular data . . . is quite a technical challenge.”
Part of that challenge arises from the fact that ERP covers so many sections in a business, and hoovers up data. For smaller organisations, this mightn’t be a huge issue, but they still need to take into account what type of data they have gathered and what it is used for. If it doesn’t have a purpose for your business, you must delete it.
One of the focuses of GDPR is not whether you have ERP or not, but how you use it and how well it suits your business needs.
“SMEs want best practices and the same benefits that a larger ERP system provides,” said Connor. “ [But] it doesn’t need to take over an entire organisation . . . [it can] be one division, one area, or one department at a time so that you have a chance to tailor those needs specifically for your organisation and your sector, not change your whole organisation to suit a mammoth software of yesteryear.”
Having newer features like AI for the sake of it won’t get you far. “Like . . . CRM of years gone by, there’s no point in buying something because of the acronym or . . . saying it will do wonders for me,” Connor said.
The entire purpose of ERP is to empower teams in different departments. The end goal should be letting teams become more productive, helping them generate better customer service while retaining and winning more clients.
Tied in with that is identifying the next stages of automation and efficiency so ERP systems can evolve to meet changing business needs. More often than not, employees are accessing services on the cloud through their smartphone, laptop, browser and elsewhere and a modern system needs to cater for that.
“You do need to be able to articulate and understand the real benefits each of these will give to you. As AI and the Internet of Things permeates down from the large multinationals . . . they become affordable solutions [for SMEs] . . . The challenge for any business now is to see how can they adopt these changes in technology to improve what they do.
“For example 20 years ago if an average distribution in Ireland was comparing against the Amazon equivalent then, they could never afford the scale of solutions available, but they could see how it would benefit them,” said Connor. “So now between web trading, apps on the road and automated warehousing, there’s so much that’s affordable and adaptable, that’s where they need to look ahead.
“Identify what you would love to do in time and that may evolve from your existing system or indeed you may realise it as you see where your business is going.”
Taking that approach highlights the pain points or frustrations your business may face over time. Products change over time too and what you may be using now might not be fit for purpose a few years from now.
“As you understand the real frustrations of your existing software combination, now you’re defining your wish list for the future,” said Connor. “That’s what you bring to a new provider, saying we’ve identified the limitation . . . [and you can say] ‘in the last 20 years, they were great and worked for us, but they’re not best practice’.
“Changing the process and adopting the right technology will harness the benefits for clients who take a little bit of time to think it through and plan accordingly.”

Firms must deal with data risks in the boardroom

Highlight: Are you uninformed about the GDPR enforcement regime, and the new litigation that will populate the Irish Courts and preoccupy the C-suite? Then read on 
Body


When a scandal breaks in Ireland, a weary public expects a diet of a tolerance of incompetence, a lack of leadership and a dearth of consequences. However, from Thursday GDPR will profoundly alter the dynamic going forward. It heralds a power shift away from companies (whether data controllers or data processors) towards data subjects, ie, ordinary people, clients and customers.
Much has been said about the need for senior management ‘buy in’ to the many GDPR compliance projects ongoing in businesses. Less has been spoken about the consequences that will unfold before the courts for the organisations that are not in compliance.
If a customer or employee believes that their personal data rights have been infringed by a company (whether as a controller or processor) then they can go to court to seek various orders and, importantly, they can sue for compensation. Others affected by the fallout will potentially also have a cause of action, for example a spouse whose partner became ill from the stress, or a journalistic source who is exposed in a data breach.
So, while GDPR introduces the potential for much greater regulatory fines, those are not likely to be the fallout that puts a fault-line in a company’s finances. Instead, the new ‘Data Protection actions’ that ordinary people can bring will do that.
Once proceedings are issued it won’t be long before a forensics team hired by the opposing lawyers will be pouring over the internal corporate workings. Any idea of ‘quick fixing’ compliance will not work. Efforts to do that will be seen for what they are and will likely just increase the damages to be paid.
Data Protection actions will be legally considered as torts. As in other tort actions, such as negligence, it is likely that the other side will be entitled to relevant and necessary discovery – so how your company complies with GDPR will be on public show in the Circuit or High Court, and therefore potentially in the media.
It is going to become clear pretty soon which companies have competence in dealing with personal data and which ones cannot be trusted. The new enforcement regime will sweep all this information into the public domain.
When corporate governance is functioning properly it ensures that companies have the systems and controls in place to manage the flow of information, so that they can make the right decision at the right time.
An effective system of corporate governance requires, leadership, independence, competence, and challenge. Of these, competence is ‘king’ and an understanding of the new GDPR enforcement regime is therefore vital for a board and senior management to ensure effective compliance within their organisation.
There are many potential infringements of GDPR that could give rise to a Data Protection action, but let’s focus on data breaches. The regulatory fines for data breaches are at the lower threshold, reflecting the fact that breaches do and will happen.
However, there will be mandatory notification to data subjects where there has been a data breach that poses a high risk “to their rights and freedoms”. You have to assess that risk objectively and make a detailed written record of how you went about it.
Mandatory reporting is a game changer because once the individuals concerned are informed about the data breach, it can lead to them (and others damaged by the breach) issuing Data Protection actions. You will also have to inform the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) if the breach poses a risk (not necessarily a high risk) and do so within 72 hours, so it will all happen in a whirlwind.
Data breaches are typically categorised into three types.
A confidentiality breach is where there is an unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data. An example would be emailing personal data to the wrong group of individuals, or giving access to third parties without a legal basis for doing so.
An availability breach is where there is unauthorised access to, or destruction of, personal data. An example would be an infection of ransomware, or misapplying a data retention policy and erroneously deleting information.
An integrity breach is where there is an unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data. An example would be changing someone’s health records accidentally or without authority.
There could be a cause of action against an organisation on foot of any of these.
GDPR provides that “any person who has suffered a material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement . . . shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered”. There is a lot in those three lines.
Firstly, the term “non-material damage” covers non-financial damage, such as personal distress. Secondly, the right to compensation extends to “any person” – arguably both to a natural person and to a corporate entity.
Thirdly, the right to receive compensation is from the data controller or processor and so joint liability and several liability applies. That is why contracts between data controllers and processors are vitally important in addressing the issue of risk apportionment/indemnification in these scenarios, particularly if you are contracting with a party outside the EU.
So what can you do to hedge these new risks arising under GDPR? Here are four steps to take.
1. GDPR exists to safeguard personal data, so good back-up procedures are essential. Where are last week’s back-ups for your company? Do a spot check. Ask for them tomorrow and don’t take no for an answer. Unfortunately, many senior executives only find out they don’t have back-ups when they absolutely need them.
2. Your IT systems should automatically log the movement of data so that you are in a position to quickly investigate what may have gone missing or been compromised, when and by whom. Ask for a demonstration as to how your business achieves this outcome.
3. How comprehensive is your cyber insurance? Will it cover claims falling under Data Protection actions or fines by the regulator? Make sure it is sufficient. For example, you could have on-going functionality issues during and after a ransomware attack, so you may want insurance to cover losses whilst getting the business fully operational again.
4. Make sure you have access to all the expertise you need on a 24/7 basis, 365 days a year. Besides IT and insurance support, you will also need urgent legal advice. Seeking this early on may mean that your internal communications attract legal privilege – otherwise they could potentially be discoverable to litigants later.
Corporate reputations can be easily lost, and are extremely hard to restore. I mentioned earlier that a breach posing a risk must be reported to the ODPC within 72 hours. At this stage, we have about the same amount of time before we all enter the new regime. Are you ready?

Highlight: How many Irish restaurants stay the course? And why are some struggling or going bust? A new survey provides some clues 
Body


The best way to make a small fortune in the restaurant industry is to start with a large one. It’s an old joke, but it has more than a ring of truth about it.
Many entrepreneurs have harboured dreams of running their own restaurant or café, then found the reality to be tougher than they ever imagined. But a new study by two Irish academics may provide some encouragement to those who are thinking about getting into, or are already in, the restaurant trade.
JJ Healy of the Cork Institute of Technology and Máirtín Mac Con Iomaire of the Dublin Institute of Technology have just had their paper on Irish restaurant failures published in the Journal of Culinary Science and Technology. The pair have used longitudinal census data to try to get a true picture of the failure rate in the sector, and have found that it is considerably lower than perceived.
There is, they write, a “persistent myth” that as many as nine out of ten restaurants will fail in their first year, but their research shows that in fact the one-year failure rate in Ireland is 15 per cent.
After three years, that rises to just under 38 per cent, while the figure after five years is just over 53 per cent. Failure rates in the sector are “higher, but not dramatically so” than industries such as construction and manufacturing.
What’s likely to be of key interest to many people in the sector is Healy and Mac Con Iomaire’s lists of common success and failure factors for restaurants.
Things that restaurateurs whose surviving businesses have in common, they find, include having a clear vision and a distinctive concept, but being willing to amend their strategies if necessary; having a good work/life balance; adapting new technologies for things like record-keeping and tracking customers; and continuing to educate and develop their managers.
On the flipside, those whose ventures fail are more likely to disrespect their staff, opt for the wrong pricing strategy, underestimate their competition and let their own ego get in the way of what’s right for their business.
“The human factors are really important when you’re running a restaurant, but a lot of people forget about them,” Healy tells me.
His and Mac Con Iomaire’s research looked at restaurants that began trading in 2008 and 2009, and tracked them through to 2013. Of course, in that time, costs have begun to rise sharply for restaurateurs, most notably when it comes to rent, and Healy believes this is likely to see the failure rate rise over the next while.
“I know of one restaurateur in the middle of nowhere who’s just had a rent review, and whose landlord is looking for double what he’s currently paying,” Healy says. “In Ireland, we seem to go straight from recession into greed. There never seems to be any middle ground.”
It’s certainly a point worth chewing on for any potential restaurateurs.
Who’d have thought that Ballincollig (population: 18,621) would one day feature in the editor’s letter of a magazine with 9.7 million readers?
The Cork town has Samantha Barry to thank for this. The Ballincollig native, who was appointed as editor-in-chief of Glamour earlier this year, has just unveiled her first edition, in which she reminisces about earning her first job stacking shelves in a local supermarket.
The content of Barry’s first issue is an interesting mix of things you might expect to find in a women’s glossy, like a swimwear guide and a summer reading list, to others you might not, like a feature on four women driving the cryptocurrency sector.
To say Barry’s appointment caused a stir is to understate the case significantly – she’d never worked in a magazine before, having joined from CNN, where she was head of social media and emerging media (the BBC, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, RTÉ and Newstalk also feature on her CV).
But it continued a recent trend at Glamour’s publisher, Condé Nast, to surprise the magazine industry with its appointments to key positions -- the influential fashion stylist Edward Enninful replaced Alexandra Shulman as editor-in-chief of British Vogue last spring, while Radhika Jones, a former New York Times books editor, took the top job at Vanity Fair last autumn.
Conde Nast’s still relatively new chief executive, Bob Sauerberg, will be hoping these and other disruptors in his organisation will help weather the storm facing magazine publishers around the world.
PwC believes that annual print advertising revenue at US consumer magazines will fall to $6.7 billion by 2021 – it was $13.6 billion in 2012 – and reckons circulation will be down 23 per cent by then too. So Barry’s tenure is likely to be a challenging one, but she’s got some heavy hitters in her corner.
The legendarily frosty Anna Wintour, who encouraged her to apply for the Glamour job, had this to say about her last month: “When I interviewed Sam, it became apparent that she had been preparing for this job her entire life. Her experience working in more than 25 countries, reporting and training journalists in broadcasting, technology and social media made it clear she was ready to take on Glamour at a time of such seismic change in our culture.”
High praise indeed for the woman from Ballincollig.
[caption id="attachment_416862" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Dromoland Castle is undergoing a €20 million refurbishment[/caption]
If you’ve been looking into booking a break at Dromoland Castle in Co Clare over the past few days, you’ll have noticed that that it has a swanky new website.
It’s all the better to show off the fruits of a €20 million investment programme that will be fully complete by next April.
A lot of that money has been spent behind the scenes, according to the castle’s managing director Mark Nolan (“unglamorous stuff like pipes and wiring”), but a revamped swimming pool area will open shortly, and the entire place is shining like a new pin in readiness for the hordes of high-spending Americans who will flock there this summer.
Seventy per cent of Dromoland’s business is generated by US-based customers, but with only 98 rooms to fill, Nolan isn’t too worried about being overly dependent on that market. “They love Ireland, they love Dromoland and they are happy to pay the rates that we’re looking for,” he says.
The average room rate at Dromoland is now around €335 a night, up by €100 a night over the past four or five years. Nolan does feel there is scope to attract more Indian and Middle Eastern visitors to the estate, but he isn’t spending much time on targeting the Chinese market.
“They don’t want to pay the rates we need to get to make this place work,” he says. “They want to keep their money to spend in Gucci and Prada.”
“Is it always this sunny?” Niel Alobaidi wondered last week as he arrived in Dublin to oversee the launch of Emirates Holidays here.
Alobaidi, who’s been managing director of the travel company since 2015, was probably happy to hear that it isn’t, as he’s hoping to tempt a lot more of us to take a holiday in Dubai, as opposed to just pass through it on our way to somewhere else.
Forty per cent of the firm’s business is now accounted for by families, according to Alobaidi, and he expects that figure to rise further when the new theme parks that are planned for the emirate get up and running.
“We’re not after the mass market – Dubai is never going to be a cheap destination – but we believe we offer great value for what we deliver,” he says.
The properties it offers are all four and five-star, and include the Irish-owned Bonnington Jumeirah Lakes Towers, and the incredibly over the top Atlantis The Palm, with its waterpark, 23 restaurants and underwater suite. Who needs subtlety when you can have sun, sea and souks?

A great location and daily running costs of about €4, means interest is bound to be high in the Cosgrave brothers’ latest scheme of houses in south County Dublin.
The group is launching the first 30 units in a new scheme of 78 four and five-bedroom family homes at Fairways at its Cualanor development on the grounds of the former Dún Laoghaire Golf Club this weekend.
The A-rated houses, which are being sold by agent Hooke & MacDonald, span between 205 and 227.5 square metres are located off Upper Glenageary Road, close to Dún Laoghaire, Monkstown and Sandycove/Glasthule.
Proud of their green build, eco-efficient construction credentials, the Cosgraves have focused on and identified where energy savings can be made in each of their schemes. They have developed their own suite of efficient construction details which they expect will outperform the comparable standards from the Department of Housing, according to the agent.
The group has monitored both the running cost of the houses and how they perform at Fairways and estimate the cost of living in a house in Fairways will be less than about €4 per day including Vat, standing charges and public service obligations.
Of the 30 houses currently on offer, four-bedroom plus study Alder houses span some 205 square metres and are priced from €795,000, while the Bird houses of 227.5 square metres have five bedrooms and cost from €885,000.
Each Fairways house has a large living, dining and kitchen space leading to a paved patio and landscaped garden. There’s a lounge also at ground level and an additional entertainment room at first floor, which offers a second reception room for the family.
Also upstairs, a generous master suite comprises a large bedroom with a roomy en suite and a walk-in wardrobe. All Fairways bedrooms are double bedrooms and have quality wardrobe storage solutions finished with Cambrian Oak interiors and light grey design doors.
A hot press on the first floor landing area houses a heat recovery ventilation system that works together with passive house features to deliver high energy efficiency and a constant flow of fresh air.
Located directly off Upper Glenageary Road with pedestrian access to Tivoli Road via Eglington Park, Fairways homes have easy access to all the amenities of Dún Laoghaire town centre and Monkstown Village including eateries, shops, local facilities, good schools, coastal amenities, civic amenities, sports clubs and great transport links including regular Dublin Bus services and the Dart at Dún Laoghaire.
The family friendly scheme is set on well-landscaped grounds of the seaward side of the former old Dún Laoghaire Golf Club, grounds that include woodland areas, a six-acre park, open spaces, a piazza, jogging paths, a series of feature areas and a children’s playground.
There are two show-houses open today from 2.30pm to 4pm and again on Tuesday and Thursday, May 22 and 24, from 1pm to 2pm.
For more details contact the agent at 01-6318402.

It was through his experience working in sales and marketing for Errigal Country House, his parent’s hotel in Co Cavan, that Ronan Kelly spotted the potential to develop a sales platform for wedding venues.
Kelly, who has a degree in computer applications, established Bespoke Choice in Cootehill a year ago with his brothers Niall and Cillian.
“We’d spent a lot of time and effort over the years refining our wedding offering. It’s up there with the best in the region, but we found ourselves in a highly competitive landscape,” said Kelly.
“We were following the same sales process for weddings used by every other venue in the country and I felt we weren’t really portraying why our offering was better.”
Bespokechoice.com is a sales platform aimed at helping wedding venues increase wedding bookings and boost the revenue generated by each one.
Prospective customers can use the interactive Bespoke Choice app to explore venues they are considering and put together a tailored wedding package for their big day.
“We use VR tours, videos of chefs describing dishes and a lot of engaging content,” said Kelly.
“We have a host of the other event management tools and, once a booking is made, the software uses AI to maximise upsell revenue for the venue.”
Bespoke Choice is priced at €3,500 per venue for an annual subscription. Kelly is offering the first 20 venues that sign up to the service a half-price subscription for their first year.
“The product just launched this month and we’ve eight trial customers in Ireland and Britain,” he said.
“We’re on the lookout for a partner that is right for us to speed up our expansion, but we’re doing quite well growing organically.”
Bespoke Choice will be one of four finalists competing for the €2,000 cash prize at the One2Watch competition, taking place at FutureScope on May 31 in Dublin.
“After a year of development and customer testing, we have a strategy in place for sales starting in Ireland and Britain and then on to the US,” said Kelly.
“Most of our competitors concentrate on tools for back-end event management for the wedding venue.
“Our focus is on making the wedding booking experience more tailored, engaging and fun for both the couple and the venue.”

Hardware proves a solid bet for family firm

John Foley, managing director of Doyle’s Wholesale, joined the family-owned business in Castlecomer, Co Kilkenny, six years ago, at a time when Ireland’s construction sector had hit a wall.
A former building contractor, Foley had worked in construction for 15 years. But with the sudden downturn in the sector, he found himself at a career crossroads.
Doyle’s Wholesale is owned by the MP Doyle Group, formed originally in 1884 by James Doyle, great-grandfather of the present owner, Michael Doyle.
“I had built a number of projects for Michael and his partners during the boom, so when vacancies became available at the company, he asked me to join,” said Foley.
“It was a huge change. Construction is a transient business. You set up a crew, you build and you move on.
“When I joined Doyle’s, there were people there whose parents had worked for the company. That changes the way you lead and manage people. It’s a static business, so it’s all about building relationships.”
The MP Doyle Group was originally founded on Shamrock Square in Carlow town on St Patrick’s Day, 1884.
When Michael Doyle took over the company, it employed just ten people and consisted of a bar, grocery and hardware store. It now has more than 100 staff employed in numerous retail and wholesale activities.
“Being the fourth generation to take over the business, Michael went out into the world after he finished his education. He worked for Brooks Thomas in Dublin and learned his trade, focusing primarily on hardware,” said Foley.
“At that stage in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the business was as it had always been. When Michael came in he closed the pub, got out of the food trade and focused on hardware.
“It then developed into an equipment hire business and that then spawned Doyle’s Wholesale, which is one of a number of companies in the group.”
Doyle established Doyle’s Wholesale in 1979. The MP Doyle Group also has two hardware stores in Carlow and Tullow trading under the Topline Doyle’s brand, as well as a discount retail outlet in Carlow.
“The Topline connection comes from Michael being one of the founding members of the Topline buying group,” said Foley.
“That was founded out of necessity, because some of the bigger competitors at the time had more buying power than the small independents, so Michael partnered with other merchants to set up Amalgamated Hardware, the buying group that became Topline.”
Doyle’s Wholesale supplies gardening and construction power equipment from manufacturers including Castelgarden, Briggs and Stratton, Alpina and Italian garden power equipment brand Stiga.
The company recently signed up Irish Rugby Union player Tadhg Furlong as brand ambassador for Stiga.

If you’re in the right business, even Brexit has a silver lining

Highlight: For commercial translator Vistatec, Britain’s exit from the EU could offer a great opportunity for expansion 
Body


Although the uncertainty generated by Brexit is a concern for many companies, global content solutions company Vistatec is expecting it to create a great opportunity for expansion, according to Patrick Kelly, its co-founder and chief commercial officer.
Founded in 1997, Vistatec translates and adapts brands’ content into 150 languages to ensure it will make sense in local markets.
“We don’t have many British clients ourselves so we are lucky from that perspective, but what we do see is that Brexit means customers and potential customers are looking to expand away from English-speaking [markets] and Britain,” Kelly said.
“If anything, it will generate more opportunities for us to facilitate customers who want to go global and reduce the risk of just being a provider to British-based customers.”
The industry has changed rapidly in the two decades since the company was founded. Large organisations used to give out localisation contracts that lasted six months, but that has changed considerably over the years, Kelly said. Now Vistatec interacts with most of its clients on a daily basis.
“They send out work they want changed today and they want it back tomorrow. It is an interactive process now where they need stuff back pretty much instantaneously. The amount of content and different types of content that they are generating has grown exponentially as well.”
Vistatec has 140 employees in total. Of these, the majority are in its Dublin HQ with about 12 in the US, in its office in Mountain View, California and others working in sales from home offices there. It also has some project management employees across mainland Europe and South America. Vistatec also employs people living in and from the regions where the content is required to ensure that the context is maintained.
“We cover most of the languages across the globe from Afrikaans to Zulu,” he said.
“Content has to be localised. It has to read well. It has to make sense in the target language – whether it is French, Slovenian or Japanese – to allow the client to make sure their brand message is maintained.”
People care more about content now because it is everywhere. And it has to be right. “We absorb content at a rate that we never did before. It is there. It is visible and it is instantaneous.”
The tools of the industry have evolved from manually translating to using computer-aided translation tools and machine translation tools.
Kelly said there still needed to be human interaction for fine tuning but new technology did give a good base from which to start and this saved time and money.
It is essential Vistatec keeps up with the latest technologies. But the company decided at an early point to use tried and tested products developed by competitors instead of developing its own.
It has an internal software team that builds solutions for its clients using the industry standard software already available.
“That might mean that we have to pull together different applications and create a bridging connector to make sure that the work moves from the client to our language partners seamlessly and then back again,” he said.
“So we use what is out there and the build connectors or robots to build that customised solution.”
At the moment, Vistatec is focused on growing its customer base. It already supplies companies in four main verticals: technology, life sciences, retail and travel.
“Within those verticals, there is a huge range of potential customers that we can target.”
It launched the Think Global Forum last year, a series of events to bring together industry experts, like-minded companies and potential clients, to learn from each other as part of its customer acquisition plans.
“The idea is to get them in a room together. Hopefully they will learn something and then, when they are ready to go global, hopefully they will call on Vistatec.”
It also issues a quarterly magazine, VTQ Magazine, for clients and potential clients. “Again it allows us to spread the word and to produce articles that will be of interest to those about to go global and those that have gone global.”
Both initiatives have allowed Vistatec to broaden its platform over the past 18 months.
The company is expected to grow 9 per cent to year-end June 30. It expects to grow 8 to 12 per cent each year. There were tough years during 2007 to 2012, Kelly said.
“We weathered the storm and that is down to the tight management team we have here. We have all been on the team together for the past 15 years or so.”
For the past four years the company has experienced a lot of growth.
“We have also maintained our view to grow organically. Some of our competitors tend to grow by acquisition. We have stayed out of that as we have seen how sometimes it does not work that well.”
It has been approached by potential buyers several times, he said.
“I suppose if someone came and offered us €1 billion for it we’d take it, but we’re not looking around. We have been approached several times but it is not something we really want to get into. We have a lot more to do yet before we want to sell up. Once you do that, you lose control and that is something that is very important to us.”

Joining the dots on ERP

Highlight: Many ERP services now offer a cloud-based service, but it’s not so much the trends as the infrastructure that is holding Ireland back, writes Quinton O’Reilly 
Body


For some companies, the ERP question is usually what type of service you want as opposed to whether you need one or not. Some might want the convenience of a cloud-based service; others may want on-premise or a hybrid solution.
While the technology itself is there, there is another element that can determine the type of service you use. It’s not as simple as weighing up the pros and cons of what a service brings, the type of infrastructure you have can end up deciding it for you.
“When we’re looking at the suitability of our clients for our solution, you have to have talent or cash,” said Mark McArdle, the sales director of Intact Software.
“If you’re lacking in talent, you’re going to have to outsource a lot more to make up for it that way so cloud deployment in Ireland is still quite expensive.
“Intact is sold all over New Zealand or Australia and it’s 100 per cent cloud-deployed, whereas here in Ireland and Britain, it would be flipped on its head with 95 per cent on-premise deployed, and 5 per cent cloud. A lot of that is [down to the] huge cost of broadband in Ireland.
“The broadband in Australia, you’re guaranteed mega broadband and the service companies pay penalties if they don’t deliver on that. It’s a really good idea, [but] we seem to be a long way off that, both here and Britain.”
That said, McArdle does add that things are beginning to slowly change, as larger companies can invest in dedicated lines with elements like failover, but the cost of setting up and keeping this infrastructure maintained means only the larger companies can adopt this.
That probably isn’t going to change either, with McArdle saying that the type of deployment is still leaning heavily towards hybrid for the next few years.
“What we tend to see from our own deployment, adopting a hybrid is something that will be in place for the next few years,” he said. “There’s certain information that you need even when you’re disconnected and then there’s other information you absolutely have to have connectivity for so adopting the hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds.
“You can have all the information you want any time, anywhere, but there’s certain information, even in the absence of connectivity, that you need to have access to.”
Outside of infrastructure, McArdle suggests that if you’re thinking of choosing cloud or on-premise, the usual caveats apply. Knowing what your needs are and whether the ERP product in question can adapt to your needs, be it cloud or on-premise, are crucial to your success.
“If they feel that their business can adapt to the functionality that’s available on the cloud platform, that’s fine,” he said. “That’s maybe the preferred method, but if they know that they’re doing things that aren’t accommodated by the vast majority of other people using their cloud solutions, they may need to look at something more tailored for their solutions.”
In Intact’s situation, adopting a hybrid cloud model is what it will offer those in Ireland, but cloud deployment will continue to be a slow burner because of the infrastructure here.
“We’re embracing the hybrid model; we offer companies the choice of either cloud deployed or on-premise,” he said. “There are some dedicated cloud-based ERP solutions . . . some really have embraced and gone all in on that, but there are certain places they can’t get into because of connectivity and so on. So we’re adopting the hybrid model for the time being.”

Kerry brothers seek planning for iconic €20m high-rise in Cork

With a track record for high-rise development in New York, Kerry brothers Kevin and Donal O’Sullivan have designs on building a 15 storey glass-fronted building called the Prism, on the edge of Cork city’s docklands.
The brothers, through their Tower Development Properties company, plan to build the €20 million triangular office building on a brownfield site they purchased a year ago, close to the Parnell Place bush station.
The O’Sullivans, who hail from Ballinskelligs, moved to New York in the mid-1980s and set up a building company called Navillus through which they were involved in building parts of the city’s Ground Zero towers, the memorial 9/11 pools and Apple’s flagship store on Fifth Avenue.
In Cork, their purchase of the 310 square metre triangular site on Clontarf Street, which has remained unused for decades, has just been completed prompting the brothers to lodge an application with Cork City Council seeking full planning permission to build the 5,900 square metre office development on the site.
The Prism Building was designed by Cork based architects Reddy Architecture + Urbanism tasked with creating a light-filled glass office building on a cross-city corridor.
Kevin O’Sullivan, president of Tower Development Properties, said the Clontarf Street development fit in with plans for the revitalisation of the heart of the city and would give a long-awaited boost to this corner of the city.
“Our aim is to build a slender, elegant, transparent glass structure that is as much a piece of sculpture as it is a building,” he said. “The development of the Prism Building will enhance a neglected, yet strategic, area of the city with a light-filled building, providing a state of the art modern office building which is very much in demand in Cork city.
“Our hope is that this development will enhance and enliven the local area, acting as a catalyst for the development of nearby sites. It will become a location marker for a rejuvenated city quarter, providing a much-needed link between the city centre and the docklands.”
Architect Seán Kearns said the iconic Flatiron Building on New York’s Fifth Avenue was one of the inspirations for the Clontarf Street development.
“Through the height and shape of the building our goal is to produce an iconic piece of architecture that has a sense of bravura in the use of cantilevers and curved high-tech glass that we believe will be an attractive and iconic addition to Cork city’s projected growing skyline.
“The façade will have floor-to-ceiling super clear vision glass, providing the optimum combination of very high light transparency with low-reflectivity, with solar protection and thermal insulation for a pleasant indoor climate throughout the year. The glass walls will be complimented with a textured stainless steel element, adding to the ‘crystalline’ effect of the overall building,” he said.
The Kerrymen are also at an advanced stage of pre-planning consultation with Cork City Council for a separate €250 million, potentially 30 to 40 storey hotel and apartment development on the nearby Custom House site which they acquired last year.
Kevin O’Sullivan said that, given the complexity and intricacy of the Custom House project, the developers had assembled an international team of consultants, and allotted additional time to the project.

Highlight: It’s not about flowers, perfume, romantic weekends or even just putting out the bins. Domestic bliss is within reach – if only men would do the dishes 
Body


It’s cruel how early romance versus long-term relationships work, and as many a brave heart has found, what draws you together doesn’t necessarily keep you there. The initial laws of attraction are set up in such a way as to work off a range of instinctual, often primeval programming that can often have very little bearing on future compatibility, from someone’s smell to the shape of their jaw and even their height and their hair. And then beyond, as things progress from a physical connection to a more emotional one, a lot of early romance happens over shared passions – your lover’s taste in music, books or movies defining their attitude to the world and how they see it.
Those joys and shared interests can serve your relationship years later; but other things, less romantic things, come into play. In fact, it could be argued, those intellectual commonalities can become the least powerful part of your tethering. The reality of making a life, and living with another person, is much more about the unspoken elements, the seemingly small incidentals that in the first flourishes of love are about as pressing as getting hold of someone’s tax returns or doing a genetic screening.
So granular is this stuff that a recent study has found that relationship harmony (disclaimer: the study relates to heterosexual couples only) is profoundly affected not by the books you read, movies you watch, or how you vote, but whether or not you share doing the dishes. Yes, there is actual proof that of all the chores, all the physical and mental load a couple negotiates, the dirty cups, pots and pans in the sink are a dealbreaker.
The research in question, first published at the beginning of last month, was conducted by the Council on Contemporary Families (CCF), a US-based non-profit, non-partisan organisation whose aim it is to further the understanding of how and why contemporary families are changing. Its research looked at all the various domestic tasks, from shopping, cooking and cleaning, and analysed how they influenced the quality of a relationship.
“The division of dishwashing,” it found, “among all tasks, is most consequential to relationship quality, especially for women.”
On the positive side, it did find that, “contrary to arguments of a stalled gender revolution, contemporary couples more often share all routine tasks (other than shopping) than couples in the past, with the greatest change in dishwashing and laundry.” However, “the equal sharing of housework is more positively related to sexual intimacy and relationship satisfaction among more recent cohorts and more negatively related to marital discord”.
Should we be surprised? Anyone who regularly faces a used teabag in the sink, or a cup that for some extraordinary reason couldn’t make its way into the dishwasher just two feet away, or the particularly common occurrence of washing-up that, though clean for possibly several millennia, can’t seem to get into the cupboards is over-familiar with the kind of pent up resentment it can cause.
But why the dishes? Why not the hoovering, the cooking, or the more recently called out ‘mental load’ of couples with kids – the endless checklist of who has football practice, swimming lessons, is supposed to be over at Johnny’s house at 2pm or possibly just needs some extra love?
Dan Carlson, an assistant professor of family and consumer studies at the University of Utah, who was the lead author of the study, offered his summation to The Atlantic: “Doing dishes is gross. There is old, mouldy food sitting in the sink. If you have kids, there is curdled milk in sippy cups that smells disgusting.”
All of that is true. But I would go further. Doing the dishes is the most thankless, repetitive and unrewarding of all the household chores. No one pulls a plate from the cupboard and admires its beautiful sheen, or takes a well polished glass down from the shelf to behold its sparkle. People expect the sink to be clean and crap-free, and only notice when it’s not. And, it is also what those dirty dishes symbolise to women. It’s the notion that doing the dishes is somehow still our work.
For some, that realisation can come too late. Matthew Fray’s piece for the Huffington Post last year, headlined “She divorced me because I left dishes by the sink”, generated hot debate. In it, he bravely chronicled his own unwillingness to see what the dishes in the sink really symbolised. When he did, his wife was already gone. “Unfortunately,” he wrote, “most guys don’t know that she’s NOT fighting about the glass. She’s fighting for acknowledgement, respect, validation and his love.”
Brigham Young University and Utah State University colleagues in their pithily entitled 2013 study ‘Father Involvement, Father-Child Relationship Quality, and Satisfaction with Family Work: Actor and Partner Influences on Marital Quality’, in the Journal of Family Issues surveyed 160 heterosexual couples to see how the parents divided household responsibilities and how those chores affected the husbands’ and wives’ relationships. “The more wives perceived that husbands were engaged in routine family work tasks, the better the relationships were for both partners,” lead researcher said Adam Galovan said.
What was interesting in the CCF study, however, was that despite generations of change, traditional male-female setups continue to result in women doing the most routine, onerous, “indoor” housework, with men maintaining their hold on the less frequent, more interesting, and “outdoor” chores. Affirming my long-held pet theory: men assemble shelves to display their trophies, women clean the loo because they can’t take it any more. Men’s relationship to chores has historically been, and for some still is, a circular one that all too often doesn’t extend to anyone else.
There was a positive note in the study, though, which also found that the couples getting it right are on to a good, long-term thing. “Research from prior generations,” it stated, “found that although achieving such egalitarian pairings is difficult and not without consequence, couples who set out and are able to maintain such arrangements experience a great deal of satisfaction and closeness.”
Further proof, then, that those who refuse to see the symbolism in the sink are missing a profound opportunity before them. The greatest relationship open goal is staring them in the face: it is not, contrary to what marketers would have you believe, perfume, jewellery or an occasional splurge at the local restaurant that will get you closer to your partner, it’s doing the dishes, either as much, if not more than she does. The sooner men start connecting those dots, the closer we’ll all be to relationship nirvana.

Limerick-developed device targets key global killer Therapy fights body’s response to sepsis infection

A medical device under development in Limerick will give doctors worldwide access to a new therapy to treat patients with sepsis.
Cala Medical was established in February 2017 by Brian Noonan, former executive director of infection bioscience at AstraZeneca US.
According to Noonan, sepsis affects more than 26 million people worldwide each year, resulting in six million deaths.
“Sepsis is caused when the immune system overreacts to an infection in the bloodstream and goes out of control,” he said.
“It attacks the patient’s organs as it tries to clear the infection. Septic shock and multi-organ failure can then occur and they can lead to death.”
The Cytoflow5 device that Cala Medical is developing is aimed at reducing this overstimulated immune response, by targeting the immune system trigger C5a.
“By destroying the activity of C5a in the blood, the immune system is brought back under control,” said Noonan.
“Our most important USP is that our product can be used with any sepsis patient, no matter what the initial cause of the infection.
“It’s not like antibiotics or other blood-filtering devices, which only work on a subset of cases caused by particular bacteria or viruses. Cytoflow5 works directly on the human immune response.”
Noonan co-founded Cala along with academics Jakki Cooney and Todd Kagawa.
Cooney is a senior lecturer and Kagawa a senior research fellow at the University of Limerick’s Department of Biological Sciences.
“Jakki and Todd have been working on the science behind Cytoflow5 for many years in an academic setting,” said Noonan.
“The unique nature of the enzyme and its specific effect on the human immune system got them thinking about how to use it as a therapy.
“We’ve now brought the device to prototype stage, and we’ve shown it to be effective in destroying the activity of C5a in human blood.”
Cala Medical is situated in UL’s Nexus Innovation Centre. It recently doubled its laboratory space ahead of plans to hire eight staff to conduct product testing, safety and clinical studies.
“Within 12 months, we would like to have progressed to the point of clinical trial,” said Noonan.
“We’ve already reached a significant milestone where the reduction of C5a in human volunteer blood has been shown to have the desired effects on neutralising the sepsis cascade.
“Our plan is to partner with an established multinational with a strategic interest in the blood therapy field.”
Cala Medical is a client company of state agency Enterprise Ireland. “Enterprise Ireland funded the project early on via the Commercialisation Fund and they’re funding us now as part of the HPSU program,” said Noonan.
“We’ve had support from their offices in Boston and Germany, which has helped us to establish connections with other companies and clinical organisations in those markets.”
Noonan is also a member of Enterprise Ireland’s Founders Forum.
The initiative brings together company founders with varying backgrounds, facilitating group sessions during which members can discuss and debate issues relevant to their company’s growth phase.

Lisney’s commercial property division has brought the entire of Block B at Nutgrove Office Park in Rathfarnham in Dublin 14 to the market. The property is for sale by private treaty with offers being sought in excess of €7 million, representing a capital value of €175 per square foot.
This is an opportunity for owner occupiers and investors to purchase a modern office building below current construction costs. According to the agent, the guide price represents a significant discount to prime suburban pricing.
Block B is a modern four-storey office building, built in 2007. The building is currently divided into three units and is finished in a mixture of ‘shell and core’ and completed office accommodation.
The entire block extends to about 40,000 square feet (about 3,716 square metres) on a gross internal basis and represents the largest vacant office building available for sale in south Dublin. Some 45 car parking spaces are included in the sale.
According to Lisney managing director Duncan Lyster, “with demand outstripping supply, this is an excellent opportunity for someone to purchase a completed office block at a price below the estimated build cost and have it rented, occupied and earning a return in a very short space of time”.
The block has an estimated rental value in the region of €685,000 per annum (upon 100 per cent occupancy) and the potential to amalgamate each of the blocks, which affords an incoming purchaser an excellent asset management opportunity.
Nutgrove Office Park is an established office park in south Dublin with about 160,000 square feet (almost 15,000 square metres) of office space. The park is situated south of Nutgrove Avenue and is approximately 6km south of Dublin city centre.
There are a number of high-profile occupiers in the immediate area such as Lidl, Aldi, Home Store & More, a HSE primary care centre and Harvey Norman.
Block B has ample parking facilities, is within walking distance of Dundrum Luas station and is well serviced by Dublin Bus.
More details are available from the agent at 01-6382700.]

Highlight: At Indeed’s annual conference Indeed Interactive in Austin, Texas, the job search giants are focused on innovations such as ‘structured interviews’ and new tools for both job seekers and companies 
Body


Everything is new or under construction. The Fairmont hotel, open all of two months in Austin, Texas, is surrounded by building works. Out the windows there are cranes everywhere. The city, long associated with the tech scene, is undergoing another massive growth spurt.
Austin wasn’t cheap when Indeed set up here, but it’s a changing environment that presents its own challenges to any business. The city has amenities, a young, educated population, and plenty to attract recruits.
It’s also got rent issues, as the growth of the city makes the cost of living increasingly onerous. That’s not a whole lot different to Dublin right now; the most noticeable difference is the weather. While the summer continues to tease Ireland with its arrival, it’s a brutal 33 degrees here during Indeed’s annual conference Indeed Interactive.
Five years ago, half of the total attendance could have comfortably fit in the room in which Paul D’Arcy, Indeed’s senior vice-president of marketing, sits. Only 40 people were at that maiden event. Now, it’s taken over the Fairmont, with over 1,600 attendees. The growth is pleasing to D’Arcy, but he also sees a challenge in working around it.
“We invest in a few things. The first thing we are quick to invest in is our employee experience. We don’t shy away from popular urban environments and invest heavily in those locations for our employees. Those costs go up as these markets change, but for us it’s best for our employees,” D’Arcy told The Sunday Business Post.
The attraction of vibrant city centres works for Indeed, but D’Arcy sees a broader challenge for its clients as property prices climb. “We’re at this interesting moment where people can, in many roles, work from anywhere. There are people with marketable skills, like software engineers, who can choose the city and country they want to work in,” he said.
“This means we see an enormous migration of talent where people with those skills want to live; they’re optimising for happiness. The thing that holds that growth back is housing costs.”
D’Arcy sees Indeed’s own growth as something that gives him an understanding of the challenges for companies trying to get bigger. The business now has over 5,000 staff worldwide, including 500 in Dublin where its EMEA headquarters is located. That part of the business is growing too, with the company currently on St Stephen’s Green, but moving back to Silicon Docks later this year to manage the increased numbers.
[caption id="attachment_416792" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Raj Mukherjee, the company’s senior vice-president of product Pic: Brian Birzer[/caption]
“We’ve been lucky to grow at a strong rate from our beginning. Our growth is only going to be as strong as the innovation we bring to market to make getting a job and hiring easier. With our growth comes a lot of change. Every six months it feels like a new company,” said D’Arcy.
“We’re obsessed with simplicity - we try to focus on the smallest number of things that have the biggest impact. Anyone who is looking for a job, anywhere in the world, will still say it’s too hard to do. For us, evolving the job search is the number one priority.”
For companies to move with the changing habits of how people choose what they do, D’Arcy thinks they need to get smarter. In his opening address at Interactive, he drew heavily on Moneyball. The concept, from baseball, is about using data to do a better job of finding the right person for the job that subjective analysis could miss.
“When we look at the recruiting processes today, there are so many imperfections that creep into the way we hire. Those imperfections eliminate opportunities for a lot of people who would be best in a role,” said D’Arcy.
“If businesses could find the best person for each job, they’d be able to grow faster, do better, get things done quicker, and it’s also something that’s simply not fair.”
An increase in analytics and removing subjective factors is necessary for companies to get a broader pool of talent, according to the Indeed senior vice-president.
“The most important thing for employees is the purpose, what brings them to work each day. After family and health, a career is probably the most important thing for most people. They want the ability to set their own direction, to work on what’s meaningful for them, and to work with people that treat them with respect,” he said.
“There are still a lot of voodoo hiring methods out there. There’s an opportunity to move towards a more scientific assessment of talent. It’s critical that organisations figure out how to reach out, connect with the widest possible pool of talent, and then implement selection mechanisms that help them find exactly who is the best fit.
“Hiring has arbitrary factors that compete with facts. Those can be reaction to appearance, personal background, the brand names of their previous employers or schools. If you can get beyond that, you can open your talent pools.”
A three-pronged approach, beginning with quantitative assessments on both general mental ability and integrity, combined with improving the interview format, is key to getting more objective in D’Arcy’s mind.
“Those two things [mental ability and integrity] are not completely correlated, they measure different things, but together they provide a strong signal in how someone will learn on the job and do the right thing in the workplace,” he said.
“Complementing that is the use of structured interviews. You’ve got to go in with specific questions and criteria, to calibrate the candidate. If you can do all that, you can predict a lot about how someone will do on the job.
“If you do a structured interview, gathering information in the right way, they can be effective. Interviewers need to be wary of the signals where our mind has strong impressions so they have to know to be able to turn those off.”
The business is anything but shy about its success - even the wifi password for the event was ‘greatness’ - but it is all too aware that data is fundamental to keeping the growth coming.
Two of the product announcements around that at the event stood out in particular. The company pages tool is designed to find better ways for businesses to tell their stories in ways that gather the most attention and target specific skills. The new assessments tool is what it sounds like, finding new ways for job seekers to show what skills they have and how they fit the needs of potential employers.
“When we think about assessments, we look at what is important for a particular role and measure that. We can break down several skills that are necessary to be suited to a job and evaluate how they will be successful. We take live examples of how someone will perform in a job and see the degrees of comfort within which they take those tests,” said Raj Mukherjee, senior vice-president of product at Indeed.
Artificial intelligence was everywhere at the event; even the name badges required a demo. They used smart technology to track every movement and interaction made by attendees. Within such observance come privacy concerns.
Mukherjee sees privacy as an opportunity to get smarter with how companies use data. For him, the upcoming general data protection regulation (GDPR) is an opportunity for the business in Europe.
“The amount of job-seeker data we have is unparalleled; how we use it is up to us. We have to be cognisant of the power that we have. There’s an acknowledgement, across the industry, that we need to do more on the privacy front.
“It’s not just a regulation, it’s best practice. Ultimately it will make us better over time. It means we will learn how to use data more effectively, storing what matters to make algorithms better.”

Highlight: Kevin O’Brien last week made history by scoring 118 runs on Ireland’s test cricket debut against Pakistan, a gruelling five-day battle that showcased the national team’s fighting spirit 
Body


A quick glance through a photo album that portrays a small snippet of Irish sporting history.
Page One. There’s a shot of Ed Joyce on the beach in Malahide playing cricket with kids – his past and maybe their future merging in the hours ahead of a new and unlikely era. Page Two. There’s Andrew Balbirnie, back in his hotel room and brushing his teeth while still wearing his fresh green kit - partly in jest, partly as a reminder that this has all actually happened. Page Three. There’s Mick Jagger, meandering about and shaking hands at an actual test match in Dublin.
But even among that glorious lot, there’s one image that causes you to stare a little deeper.
After leaving the crease a centurion on Monday, just the third player to achieve that feat on his nation’s five-day debut since Charles Bannerman did it for Australia in 1877, Kevin O’Brien was in joking form. “It’s nice to be on the imaginary honours’ board in these Portakabin changing rooms.” Cricket Ireland took notice, not so much carefully chiselling his name onto a crisp, pine backing as at Lords, rather pasting a piece of hastily-thrown-through-the-printer paper onto the cardboard wall.
It summarised much of the cricketing revolution here. Amusing at first, but take longer and look harder and you see the unlikely quality and the bristling achievement.
It’s now Wednesday morning, the game over and lost although we won’t patronise around winning respect as they’re better than that. Still, O’Brien is surprisingly fresh. “A few beers,” he says of the night before. “Nothing too bad, I was home at half two. I’m just about to cut the grass and water the plants and put down some weed-killer, so that’ll get me over any hangover. I like my routine.”
It answers a question about the silence after so much noise before it’s even asked, and it answers something more important too. No matter what this team has done, little has changed, even as they’ve climbed towards the top of the ladder. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.
Contrast that as soccer has long gone down the tunnel of ego and soundbites; as GAA desperately chased after it like an overweight pug wishing it could keep up with a greyhound; as rugby’s once-wonderful storytellers are slowly lost to the soil, replaced by bigger, better, more reticent.
O’Brien is the epitome. Never forget where you came from, although never feel compelled to go back. For instance he’s quickly recalling his father Brendan’s career as an Irish international that spanned 52 games.
“He’d get the letter in the post form Derek Scott who I think was ICU secretary. ‘Congratulations, you are selected to play for Ireland. Please be in such and such a place in Scotland on this date and bring a cheque for £20 for your gear.’ They toured Canada once, wore this horrendous baby blue blazer, he pulls it out around Halloween. But it’s remarkable even where cricket is now when you compare it against 15 or 20 years ago. Never mind against his time.”
[caption id="attachment_416892" align="alignleft" width="624"] Kevin O’Brien on day four against Pakistan at Malahide PicL: Getty[/caption]
The stories are well known and predictable to those who breathe the sport here, having laboured through many mires. But for those who are new and dipping a toe, a quick sample of that past. As recently as 2001, Ireland shacked up at a World Cup qualifier and bust-ups and injuries saw a journalist who was there to cover them brought out to play. But in 2002, Adi Birrell took over as coach and O’Brien talks of a change in attitude. The next step would require a big change in ability.
“In 2004, I was in the under-19 team that went to the World Cup and Adi was coach. A genius at getting the best out of players. But we played two warm-up games against regional teams from Bangladesh. We went in confident, we knew how we wanted to play, in qualifying we beat everyone in Europe well. And we got absolutely thrashed. Really taken apart. We’d no idea from that team nine would go on and play senior international cricket. We thought this was the zenith.”
For a complex game, O’Brien has never been overly complicated; indeed a colleague describes him as a see-ball-hit-ball kind of stylist. Initially he saw himself as a bowler and a tail-ender worth a few runs, but by the mid-2000s his self-confidence slowly grew. Little moments. A brand new course.
He says he was shaking when coming on to bowl as Ireland played their first one-day international against England in 2006 and it took a terrible shot from Andrew Strauss off a “ball that nearly bounced on my toes” to calm him as he took a first wicket. A year later came the World Cup in the Caribbean where he watched Shaun Tait bowl over 100 miles an hour on the pitch, then saw the time-delayed replay on TV, then realised he was up next to bat. He also got to face the great Muttiah Muralitharan and admits he “genuinely didn’t know what way the ball was going to turn”.
O’Brien’s outstanding memories of ’07? Getting to do the crossbar challenge on Soccer Saturday, before coming home to The Late Late Show, before days later being thrown back into the English domestic cricket scene where Ireland played as a county, as they lost to Kent during a nine-game winless streak. ‘If you can dream - and not make dreams your master.’ A motto for them all.
With some people you need colour and anecdotes. But here, outside interference isn’t required, for the sport is enough to carry it. O’Brien’s last international century was in the 2011 World Cup win over England, the fastest ever in tournament history, and he’s still never got to watch it in full. “I said to my wife a few days ago I’d love to get it but I don’t know how to. I must go looking. But without that I wouldn’t have been able to go and play in the tournaments I did. Two years in the Caribbean, one year in Bangladesh, two years in New Zealand. Off the pitch the media attention I got at the time and continue to get, even people on the street who remember that innings. Without doing that, no-one would know who Kevin O’Brien is, and that’s not meant to sound big-headed.”
The scale of his fame in the cricketing world after that knock isn’t understood in Ireland, nor how well he stood up to the pressure and attention it brought. He and a friend were in a taxi in the UAE at one stage afterwards, when the Indian driver started talking about O’Brien upon hearing his customers were Irish, never knowing one of those customers was the subject of his conversation.
The danger of living off the past though is that you can forget to live in the present. It’s why last week mattered much to him, and also to Irish cricket. The test game is hard enough to sell in its heartlands as fans prefer to binge on short and cheap formats. But to sell it in a non-cricketing country? Whatever about losing, imagine the reaction to Ireland’s debut without his century. No talking points other than not being good enough. Internal disinterest. External cynicism. Disaster.
When the team got together in advance of their first ever test, they sensed it was something different. Call it the intensity. Friends and family were talking to them about it. Malahide looked like a stadium. The media submerged them with interest and questions. “It built up so much and by Thursday, it was kids on Christmas Eve going to bed and waiting to get going.”
Christmas Day had coal in the stocking. Drizzle that wouldn’t move until after lunch. Then the heavy stuff. What’s another day when you’ve waited a lifetime. By Sunday though he realised - be careful what you wish for. “We were five for three at lunch. Eating, thinking, the nerves start to kick in. There wasn’t a lot of talk. We were in shock.” They still were by the second innings follow-on.
But then came Monday. That magical Monday.
O’Brien is a fidgety sort who describes himself as a terrible watcher. Get in his way of viewing the action on the field or on TV and he could snap. “Once I’m in the middle though I’m fine. I put on my helmet and gloves, I have the exact same routine every time, and I’m good to go then.”
That routine, like a twitch, involves walking off to the side before each delivery so he can tell himself, “Watch the ball, Balcony Boy.” They are words that go back to the 2007 World Cup build-up when working with sports psychologist Jeremy Snape. Balcony Boy is the little person on your shoulder in the changing room, that reminds you of that stupid shot you took as you undo your pads and remove your gloves. He’s a warning not to be rash, and O’Brien was in listening form.
“We were 70 behind, my mind just said let’s make them bat again, make them get one run. I didn’t want to lose by an innings. But then Thommo [Stuart Thompson] settled in and the gap is 60, 50, 35 . . . ‘Let’s keep digging in, bat another hour and we’ll be 50 ahead.’ And that drove us on. It was staying in the battle and enjoying the challenge of test cricket, of people trying to knock you over, trying to hit you in the head. You want to do everything to face that down and to feed off of it.”
He got fat off of it. “Then I’m in the 90s and I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m really close.’ When at the non-strikers end I went down on my knees in between balls. That was for me to try and control my pulse.
“I closed my eyes, took deep breaths, one at a time. The field was on the boundary, I had to be content with one and over. It was drawn out and their captain did that deliberately to make me more nervous and try and force me to take a big shot. I was a bit fortunate - 99 and an edge past a fielder, but the minute I hit it I knew it was in the gap and I ran. Tyrone [Kane] was sprinting back during the second and I was half jogging. As we crossed he was saying, ‘Three, three, three’. No way, two was fine. I wanted to embrace it. It was such a huge release and such a proud moment.”
Such is the incredible mental challenge of test cricket, a self-confrontation rarely seen in any other sport, it rarely lets you away with just the highs though. Monday night he went back to the hotel, had to get in the team’s CB Round (drinks for all when you bat or bowl a career best), spent some time going through the well-wishers on his phone, but exhaustion perversely didn’t let him sleep. Day five came - but crucially he was unable to let go of day four.
“The most difficult thing is trying to forget what you did before as it doesn’t matter, and that’s easier said than done. This huge rush is still there and you’ve to get rid of it. I struggled most with that on the last morning. When that happens, when not that switched on, that’s when you come unstuck. I nicked it to the slip, dropped my head and said to myself, ‘You absolute plonker’. I wanted to stay another few minutes and pretend it didn’t happen.”
With that went victory. But “If you can meet with triumph and disaster - and treat those two impostors just the same . . .”
That his father was lost for words other than “well done” showed up the sense of achievement for it wasn’t just about one shot and one game, but about all it took to get to that one shot and that one game. And in those Portakabin changing rooms after, coach Graham Ford said that he’d known about their fighting spirit and that had convinced him to take the job, but to see it firsthand had made him and everyone feel proud. “A nagging sense of letting it get away, but a feeling of great achievement,” O’Brien says in summary.
King for a day; back to the gardening, he has one more unlikely memory for a lifetime.

Maybe blockchain isn’t as cool as it thinks it is

Highlight: Even Mark Zuckerberg is giving decentralisation a whirl 
Body


Pop quiz: which of Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc has shouted most to investors about Bitcoin or blockchain?
The answer is: none of the above. Bloomberg’s database of regulatory filings shows no mention of either blockchain or Bitcoin in these companies’ disclosures since 2008. The closest was Netflix chief financial officer David Wells, who said on an earnings call last year that a “borderless currency” within the next decade might be nice.
This apparent silence — and bear in mind regulatory filings don’t cover social media or interviews — is telling. This is a successful billionaire class which embodies mottos like “move fast and break things” or “step by step, ferociously.”
The Winklevoss twins championed Bitcoin, but Mark Zuckerberg never did. Bill Gates has been as dismissive about it as Warren Buffett. You still can’t do your shopping on Amazon.com using digital currencies.
Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the regulatory risks involved, and deflating demand, it’s little surprise that the biggest steps taken by the tech giants have been banning ads for Bitcoin clones.
But why has there not been more excitement about speculation-free, company-friendly blockchains, which tout distributed ledgers as efficient and secure?
Big banks such as HSBC Holdings plc have been eager to promote it as a more efficient way to move secure data around without hurting its underlying business. Yet almost a decade after Bitcoin’s creation, Zuckerberg only recently pledged to study encryption and virtual currencies; he has now reportedly put a dozen people on the case.
The dinosaurs on Wall Street have been more aggressive. Financial firms have the biggest share of blockchain patents, according to law firm EnvisionIP, more than tech firms. Even then, the latter group is dominated by old-school brands like IBM.
Are tech firms simply reluctant to embrace blockchain because they see it as an existential threat? True believers argue that the technology is anathema to the powerful Silicon Valley elite, who through sheer size and market share have become incumbents themselves — like banks.
Take Facebook: it’s a centralised, entrenched middleman that sells $40 billion of ads annually thanks to user data surrendered for free. Is it any wonder that Zuckerberg might drag his feet in tinkering with this?
Blockchain startups are already being pitched that target the economics of this business: French think tank Generation Libre is proposing to help people control, authenticate and sell their data to platforms for a transparent price via a blockchain. If that took off, one could (just) imagine Facebook losing users and being forced to reinvent itself.
But maybe the tech elite knows something we don’t. If big banks have survived the past decade of fintech and crypto-disruption, and dabbled with blockchain experiments to reap the benefit of a buzzword, then maybe the wealthy and entrenched forces of Silicon Valley can do likewise without needing to panic.
The recent proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings was supposed to disrupt the venture capital funding model, but it seems to have been co-opted: witness WhatsApp rival Telegram ditching its public ICO plan after raising $1.7 billion privately.
Facebook isn’t going to torpedo its business model for the fun of it, and it’s unlikely to view rival start-ups as a threat until users sign off en masse and seize control of their data — which hasn’t happened.
Sure, big tech companies and big banks probably suffer from the innovator’s dilemma, and lean towards conservatism. But the promised crypto-revolution hasn’t materialised either.
Zuckerberg’s dalliance with decentralisation doesn’t have to bring a zeitgeist with it. It could just mean that blockchain isn’t as cool as it thinks it is.

Multi-let office investment in Citywest for sale

Body


JLL Ireland has brought eight units at 4075 Kingswood Road at Citywest Business Campus to market with a guide price in excess of €5.4 million.
Built in 2008 by Davy Hickey Properties Limited, the multi-let office investment comprises 12 two-storey own-door office units in total and is set within the 350-acre Citywest campus in south west Dublin.
The units range in size from 174 to 402 square metres and the passing rent is €410,342 per annum from seven of the eight units. There is an opportunity to increase income through letting the one remaining vacant unit. That provides an initial yield of 7 per cent, which should rise to over 7.8 per cent once Unit 6 is leased.
In addition to recent lettings, three of the seven tenants have recently agreed deals to renew their leases on expiry of their existing agreements. The overall rental value for the properties is more than €500,000 per annum based on rental levels of €18.50 per square foot and €700 per car space. The offices are finished to a high standard with raised access floors and air-conditioning throughout.
With the units under-rented, the agent said there is scope to improve returns through active asset management.
A few of the occupiers within the campus include SAP, Fidelity, Adobe and United Drug and there’s an onsite workforce of more than 7,000.
The 4075 Kingswood Road Scheme has also attracted significant national and international companies such as Lufthansa, 1E, Draeger and Amarach. The campus provides ample amenities from restaurants, shops, childcare facilities to the Luas and numerous bus routes.
The property is conveniently located just off the N7 with easy access to the country’s road network and Dublin airport.
Brian Shields of JLL said: “These recent re-gears highlight the commitment of the tenants to 4075 Kingswood Road. The lack of supply of units of this size as well as the mix of income lengths across seven tenancies provides future cashflow stability for an investor in a world-class business location.”
More details are available from Shields or his colleague John Bradish at 01-6731600.

Sligo firm scores big with Russia World Cup deal
SIS Pitches has been selected to design and lay six of the 12 football pitches that will be used in this summer’s World Cup in Russia.The Sligo company specialises in grass and synthetic pitches and sports surfaces for stadiums.
Its reinforced natural turf system and aeration technology will be used at Russian stadiums including Moscow’s Stadion Luzhniki, which will host the World Cup’s opening game between Russia and Saudi Arabia next month as well as the World Cup Final in July.
“It was an absolute honour to have been chosen to not only design, construct and install the pitch at the Luzhniki, but six of the 12 World Cup venues, working on more pitches than any other company,” said George Mullan, who founded SIS Pitches in 2001. “It’s the first time a World Cup final has been played on anything but all-natural grass. SISGrass was only launched in 2015 and already it has been installed at a number of world-class stadiums, and now the 2018 World Cup final will be played on it.”
SIS Pitches employs 340 people in Ireland, the Netherlands, the Middle East, Angola and Russia. It has 56 staff. “We are delighted that our investment in setting up an office in Russia five years ago, combined with completing new stadium pitches for Spartak Moscow and Krasnodar FC in the last few years, has been rewarded,” said Mullan.
Oliver Ireland has been awarded a three-year rebranding contract with the Malta Tourism Authority following a tender process begun last year. The company was one of 44 advertising agencies from across Europe which submitted tenders for the contract, and one of four shortlisted bidders.
MTA then put the concepts into research groups in its core markets and Oliver Ireland was awarded the contract.
“European tenders aren’t often won by Irish agencies and so we are very proud to have been awarded this and look forward to working closely with the MTA,” said Mark McCann, chief executive of Oliver Ireland.
The number of tourists visiting Malta and the outlying islands of Gozo and Comino rose from 1.2 million in 2009 to around 2.3 million last year. The country saw visitor numbers from Ireland increase by 9 per cent in 2017.
“Already we are working with 13 offices around Europe as well as the head office in Malta to supply creative solutions to their requirements for the Malta Tourism Authority,” said McCann.
[caption id="attachment_416805" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Neil Wisdom (centre), managing director, Intellicom, with David Walsh and Seamus Fahy of Merrion Vaults[/caption]
Intellicom has been selected by Merrion Vaults to deliver an interconnected telephony and networking solution for its latest safe deposit facility in Liverpool.
The purpose-built vault is located in the famous Royal Liver building in the Waterfront district. Liverpool is the fourth vault opened by Merrion Vaults with facilities also available in Dublin, Newcastle and Glasgow. It plans to open in other cities.
Merrion Vaults opened its first facility in Dublin in 2013, providing safe deposit box services to businesses and individuals to store valued items.
Intellicom’s solution for Merrion Vaults in Liverpool mirrors similar services already delivered to the other group sites and includes the design and deployment of a scalable network for voice and data connectivity and the enterprise class cloud-based telephony solution, which is interconnected with all Merrion Vaults’ other facilities.
“We have created a total communications package that is delivered seamlessly across all countries Merrion Vaults operates in, said Neil Wisdom, managing director of Intellicom.

No taxation without respiration?

Highlight: Inheritance tax is a low-yield, high-stress levy on the ordinary citizen. Maybe it’s time for another look at the system 
Body


The tax system has a tendency to be dispassionate. Most tax issues are in black and white, with few enough shades of grey in the routine which occupies most tax compliance work.
Inheritance tax, though, is different. It is charged at a time when people are often vulnerable following a bereavement and thus can be a source of disproportionate worry. Timing aside, any nation as sensitive to property rights as we are will always be suspicious of any tax levied on property or inheritances. Inheritance tax is a tax which can break up family businesses, residences and, worse, family ties in the course of being paid.
The key characteristic of inheritance tax that gives rise to these problems is the way it is calculated. Uniquely among the taxes, the critical factor is not the timing or even the amount of the inheritance, but the relationship between the giver and the receiver.
An inheritance from a stranger will be more heavily taxed than an inheritance from a parent. Essentially, anyone outside the immediate family is treated as a stranger and only a small amount of an inheritance from a stranger is exempt from tax. One-third of anything above that threshold goes to the Revenue. The tax on gifts is calculated in more or less the same way as inheritances.
This emphasis on the relationship between the giver and the receiver often doesn’t reflect the situation behind the inheritance or gift. Lifelong friendships, second relationships or decades of good neighbourliness are not recognised by the tax acts as mitigating factors in calculating the amount of tax which will be charged.
Towards the end of last year it was reported that two elderly male friends had married to forge a relationship intended, in part, to reduce future inheritance tax charges. Gifts and inheritances between spouses attract no tax charge. If that was the case, that marriage is yet another element in a compendium of manoeuvres made by people over the centuries (taxes on inheritances go back a long way) to reduce the taxman’s future share in their demise. These steps have ranged from buying graves in a preferred low-inheritance tax jurisdiction to creating labyrinthine legal structures using trust law.
Maybe this is one of the reasons why inheritance tax generates very little revenue for the exchequer. It is one of the smallest taxes. Figures published by the Revenue this week give the total inheritance and gift tax collected (together known as capital acquisitions tax) as a total of €460 million.
While €460 million is not an inconsequential sum, in the overall scheme of things it is a tiny element of the total Irish tax take. Inheritance and gift taxes bring in less than local property tax. A yield of €460 million is in the exchequer margin of error territory, making up less than half of 1 per cent of the overall total collected.
So are gift tax and inheritance tax worth the bother? Not everyone seems to think so. US president Donald Trump wanted to abolish what he termed “death taxes” as part of his tax reform programme last year. That didn’t happen, but there were significant increases to the size of estates before tax applies under new US rules.
Across the EU, the trend has been to reduce the rates, or reduce the tax bases for these taxes in recent years. Further afield, the Economist recently listed Australia, Canada, Russia, India and Norway as among countries that have abolished death duties. Yet gift and inheritance taxes persist here, perhaps more for social reasons than strictly economic ones.
The same national sensitivity to property rights can also extend to inherited wealth. There is a sense that income tax which arises from hard work and effort should be mitigated by taxes on gifts and legacies. There are always begrudgers, whose preferred mode of taxation is the type that other people pay. It would be a hard sell for any politician to completely abolish inheritance tax, which may not even be a vote-getter. Yet it would constitute a meaningful benefit for very many people, if not immediately, then in future years.
At some €30 million, the yield from gift tax is tiny, and possibly its only role is to prevent oligarchs from choosing Ireland as a preferred location from which to make gifts. But inheritance tax needs to be rethought.
Because it collects so little, it fails as a revenue-raising measure; and because it is usually a death which triggers the charge, it is needlessly intrusive on the personal circumstances of the citizen. The probate tax system, a fixed levy on the value of estates which used to apply in this country, shows that other approaches to taxing inheritances are feasible.
Meaningful reform of inheritance tax would probably have to involve its complete replacement. Only such a replacement tax would stop linking the deceased and the inheritor when making the calculation, which is critical if the tax is to be fairer and more dispassionate.

Company: Orreco
Done Deal: LA office
The clincher: “The high-performance centre is where NFL and NBA players go in the off-season to train and condition themselves, so it’s very exciting that we will be working there too” - Brian Moore, co-founder, Orreco
Orreco, the Galway-headquartered Irish sports and data science company, has opened a new office on the high-tech campus of Sports Rehab Los Angeles, a high-profile US sports training and recovery centre.
“The high-performance centre is where NFL and NBA players go in the off-season to train and condition themselves, so it’s very exciting that we will be working there too,” said Orecco co-founder Brian Moore, who will oversee all client work at the facility.
Orreco uses machine intelligence to find hidden signals in data, including GPS and performance statistics. The aim is to help improve athletic performance and reduce illness and injury.
Sports scientist Moore established the company in 2010 with haematologist Andrew Hodgson. Keith Wood, former captain of Ireland’s international rugby team, has since joined as executive director.
Orreco’s investors include golfers Padraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell, New York-based Teneo Holdings and internet pioneer Dennis Jennings.
The company secured Series A investment of €1.7 million (US$2m) last year from True Ventures, the Silicon Valley venture firm.
Orreco opened its first LA office at the time and recruited Andy Barr, former head of performance at the New York Knicks and Manchester City FC, and Ara Suppiah, team physician to 2016 US Ryder Cup team.
Its US clients have included NBA team the Dallas Mavericks, NBA player Wilson Chandler and Ryder Cup golfer Patrick Reed.
The company has established research partnerships in the US with scientists and physicians at Harvard, University of Houston and Memorial Sloan Kettering, the world’s oldest cancer hospital in Manhattan.
Orreco is collaborating with British company Isobar Compression to develop custom-fit compression garments designed to reduce the risk of Deep-Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in athletes.
Isobar compression garments aid athletic recovery by reducing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) after 48 hours of competing or training.
“We are very proud of the peer-reviewed research that drives our support,” said Moore. “We are constantly looking for evidence-based and clinically proven technology that can help our clients. We have certainly found that with Isobar Compression.”

Company: Paradyn
Done Deal: €3 million local authority deals
The clincher: “We count more than 80 per cent of Ireland’s local authorities as customers, making us leaders in government sector solutions” - Cillian McCarthy, chief executive, Paradyn
Paradyn is valuing local authority contracts secured over five years at €14 million. The Dublin-headquartered ICT services company said it had contracts with 25 of the country’s 30 local authorities and valued deals signed in the last 12 months alone at €3 million.
The company said it had won ten new public sector contracts in the past three years with local authorities, including Donegal County Council, Meath County Council and Wicklow County Council.
“Since we began working with Cork County Council and Galway County Council in 2008, we’ve steadily built up the number of local authorities we work with,” said Cillian McCarthy, chief executive, Paradyn.
“We count more than 80 per cent of Ireland’s local authorities as customers, making us leaders in government sector solutions.”
“This level of experience gives us a unique perspective on the challenges that local authority typically face and the solutions that work.”
McCarthy said the company’s local authority contracts ranged from overhauling IT infrastructure and implementing wireless WAN and managed network security solutions to desktop and server support.
“We hold an annual event that specifically caters for our government sector customers. This is an opportunity for us to highlight certain solutions that worked well and share technical updates on particular products and services,” said McCarthy.
Paradyn was formed earlier this year with the merger of sister companies Exigent Networks and Irish Telecom.
The companies merged under the shared brand Paradyn, alongside Netforce, the managed IT services firm acquired by Exigent in 2016.
McCarthy established Exigent in 2007 with co-founders Paul Casey and Rob Norton. Irish Telecom was set up two years later.
Irish Telecom sold high-speed broadband to business nationwide, while Exigent Networks offered design and maintenance services for Microwave Wireless (Wan), and also specialised in Cisco voice, video and data solutions over IP.
Paradyn offers managed IT, security, network and business connectivity services to 300 private and public sector clients from offices in Dublin and Cork. The company employs 40 people.

Porsche goes big on hybrid with Cayenne

Highlight: Cayenne SUV paves the way for electrification across its range 
Body


For the second week in a row on these pages, I test drive a brand-new, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) at its international launch (and another back on home soil). The performance figures are remarkably similar to the BMW i8 Roadster featured last week, with top speeds of around 250km/h and 0-100km/h times of five seconds or less. But this week, it’s not a slinky sports car; this is a large SUV, with comfortable, spacious seating for five and a capacious boot. This is the new Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid.
Late last year we attended the launch of the third-generation Cayenne, introduced in purely petrol format, but clearly showing a lot of promise for those in the market for a premium SUV with some sporting prowess.
At the time, Porsche confirmed it was working on diesel and hybrid variants and it’s the latter that, tellingly, arrives first. Apparently, a bigger proportion than ever before of buyers of Porsche’s Panamera executive car are opting for hybrid power, and while a diesel Cayenne is still in the pipeline, it’s suspected that this new hybrid version could be more important in global terms.
The Panamera isn’t the only car that the Cayenne E-Hybrid has been influenced by, as Porsche claims that development of its new hybrid SUV took inspiration from the company’s astounding 918 Spyder – an open-topped PHEV with nothing short of supercar performance.
Specifically, Porsche’s engineers adopted the 918’s boost strategy when in Sport and Sport Plus driving modes. For both, the Cayenne’s petrol engine (a 3.0-litre V6 making 340hp and 450Nm of torque) is permanently running and in the latter setting the battery pack is charged up as quickly as possible so that the hybrid system’s maximum performance is always on tap.
If you thought that the standing start acceleration was impressive for such a big and heavy car, you should experience the mid-range. Thanks to the assistance of the car’s electric motor (mounted between the engine and transmission), this Cayenne feels endlessly quick, and rare is the moment that you’d need such performance in daily driving.
That’s why the E-Hybrid defaults into E-Power mode, maximising its electric running. On a full battery charge (taking as little as 2.33 hours), it can theoretically drive up to 44 kilometres at speeds of up to 135km/h.
Only if the driver puts their foot all the way down, or the battery charge is depleted, does the engine kick in and the driving mode is changed to Hybrid Auto. A rotary selector on the steering wheel allows the driver to manually choose one of the driving modes, alternatively. In Hybrid Auto, the system judges when best to use electric power or petrol power or a combination of both, it’s well-judged and the transition from one to the other is smooth. Indeed, the only give-away is that the brake pedal takes on a different feel and weighting at low speeds when the engine isn’t running.
And is the E-Hybrid efficient in the real world? A glance at the official fuel economy and emissions rating would suggest as much, but as ever with PHEVs, the Cayenne only delivers those numbers when it is plugged in regularly to charge up the battery pack and then driven relatively short distances using that charge to the maximum.
By contrast, we spent several hours at the wheel on a mix of roads, with a single external charge before setting out, and the E-Hybrid averaged 10.1 litres/100km (28mpg). That’s not an especially impressive number, granted, but we did use the full 462hp at times.
So, is this car a little pointless? After all, it’s at its most efficient when used at slow speeds around town and charged up regularly, rendering the considerable power and fancy all-wheel-drive system completely unnecessary. That’s true, but this car is for those that want all that in-town efficiency in the same vehicle as one that can perform with gusto, befitting the Porsche badge on the bonnet. The Cayenne E-Hybrid certainly lives up to that billing.
Expect much more of this sort of thing to grace these pages in the coming years.

Hain Celestial Ireland – the Irish subsidiary of the multinational that bought the Cully & Sully food business – saw profits of €2.5 million in 2017, down from €3.1 million the year before.
The company paid a dividend of 3.7 million to its shareholder Hain Celestial and was sitting on accumulated profits of €9.4 million, down from €10.9 million the year before. It had turnover of €23 million, down slightly from €23.1 million the year before.
Its expenses rose from €18.9 million to €19.3 million in the same period. Directors’ shares remuneration in the amount of €257,074.
Hain Celestial had 11 employees, up from 7 the year before, and a wage bill of €731,150. The company makes soups under the Cully & Sully brand and produces food under a number of Hail’s own brands, including the Hartley’s range of jams and jellies, SunPat peanut butter and various products under the Linda McCartney range.
Fertility company Virtus Health Ireland saw its accumulated profits grow from €1.9 million to €3.5 million and its shareholders’ funds to €11.9 million in 2017, up from €10.3 million the year before.
The company was sitting on assets worth €22.5 million, including investments worth €19.1 million, cash in the amount of €1.9 million, and trade and other receivables of €1.3 million. It had €10.5 million in liabilities.
At the time of the accounts, Virtus owned 70 per cent of the Sims Clinics, Ireland’s largest IVF provider, with a put and call option on the remaining 30 per cent of the shares.
Since then, its parent company has upped its stake in Sims, the largest private Irish IVF treatment provider.
Virtus now controls 85 per cent of the company after upping its shareholding last week from 70 per cent at a cost of €4.8 million. It first invested in Sims three years ago, acquiring the initial stake for almost €15.5 million. Sims was valued at €22 million as part of the original transaction, but the new investment seems to indicate that the value of Sims has risen substantially since then.
Sims was set up by doctors David Walsh and Anthony Walsh 20 years ago, who control the remaining 15 per cent of the company not owned by Virtus. Virtus said in a statement in August that, in the year to June, turnover at Sims fell by 1.4 per cent to just under €22 million.
The cash pile at Kildare singer/songwriter Damien Rice’s company fell from €599,891 to €303,371 in 2017. The company was sitting on assets worth €674,101, down from €888,092 the previous year. It was owed €306,879 by its debtors.
It owed its creditors €674,435, down from €903,980 the year, most of which is made up of loans from directors. Rice himself is owed €426,518, down from €675,114, while his sister and manager Fiona Rice is owed €26,942. The pair shared €103,800 in remuneration, down from €112,530 the year before. Rice is the sole shareholder in the company.
Northside Dublin Publications, a company in the Dublin People group of newspapers, had accumulated losses of €368,683 in 2017, up from €289,312 the year before.
It came as the company made a loss of €79,371, up from €70,201 the year before. Northside Dublin Publications owed its creditors €629,147, down slightly from €680,479 the year before.
The Dublin People Group is the largest local newspaper group in Dublin, with several titles serving various parts of the city.
Aviation business Leadcom trimmed its accumulated losses from €1.7 million to just over €1 million in 2017.
The company made a profit for the year of €727,656, up from €170,535 the year before.
The company owed its creditors €2.9 million, while it had assets worth €1.9 million, €1.8 million of which was investments. The rest, €117,265, was cash.
The company is controlled by Conor McCarthy and Anne Townsend. McCarthy is chairman of aviation company Stobart Air and has nearly 40 years of experience in the industry. He was previously the chief executive of Aer Lingus Commuter and director of group operations for Ryanair.
He currently serves as executive chairman of Dublin Aerospace and managing director of PlaneConsult, which provides consultancy services from airline start-ups to restructuring turnarounds to a range of airlines across the world. In 2001, McCarthy founded AirAsia, which is now Asia’s largest low-fares airline.
Dansko Food Holdings saw its turnover drop from €69.1 million to €53.6 million in 2017, though it cut its costs from €67.9 million to €52.2 million so that its profits were €1.1 million – roughly in line with the previous year.
The company, which specialises in butter and cheese, had accumulated profits of €7.9 million, up from €6.8 million the year before.
Most of Dansko’s sales were in the Europe area – which saw a rise from €36.4 million to €47.2 million. Irish sales fell from €27.4 million to €6 million, while rest of the world sales fell from €5.2 million to €380,814. Dansko employed 40 people on a wage bill of €1.9 million.
Losses at online shopping technology ChannelSight rose from €1.6 million to €3.5 million in 2017.
The company owed its creditors €4 million, up from €3.1 million, and it was sitting on €1.5 million in assets, €657,847 of which was cash.

Providing adequate cover for a new generation of renters

Highlight: It is equally important for renters to consider illness cover and income protection as it is for those with mortgages, says Paul Kelly, director of ClearChoice 
Body


According to a recent report by real estate service providers Savills, more than 895,000 people are now living in rented accommodation in Ireland. That is almost 20 per cent of the entire Irish population.
Irish people are helping to create a society of renters due to the changed social and economic environment. The concept of ‘rent protection’ from both a life cover and living protection benefit perspective is key. We often see home insurance companies market the concept of ‘contents insurance’ for renters – yet the logic is rarely applied to life assurance.
Men and women in their late 20s and 30s are not engaging with professional financial advice or institutions until they make a house purchase. And house purchases are taking place a decade later than in previous generations. Any protection for your life or income increases in cost and acceptance of underwriting as we gradually get older also.
Indeed, protection coverage is suffering due to this change in engagement with the ‘renters’ generation’.
But who is falling into this evolving category?
Young families, possibly cohabiting but not yet married, have entered the ‘renters’ generation’, which leads to inheritance issues or incorrectly structured protection. In addition, single parent families find themselves renting with significant instability if unable to maintain rent payments.
Others caught in this net include ‘the renting classes’ who may not see value in life cover, but who would suffer with a loss of income to maintain lifestyle and bills such as rent or car loans.
And professional people, who may not be too concerned with life assurance on death, would certainly be concerned at a loss of income due to illness or injury or a need for a lump sum of cash to support themselves when in need.
For anyone who is currently renting or has rented recently, they will know that the inability to pay one month or two months’ rent has the potential to lead to drastic consequences, particularly in rent pressure zones.
It is much harder for a bank to legally remove a person not paying their mortgage than it is for a landlord with a tenant missing rental payments. Most landlords are not professionals, and will need a monthly rent to be paid to pay that mortgage. Failure of a tenant to pay this puts all in a difficult position.
But there are some possible solutions such as a combination of three financial products depending on the renter’s personal set of circumstances – these are life assurance (with multiple options to suit any profile), income protection and serious specified illness cover.
For the family unit which is renting, a combination of life cover or income protection or specified serious illness cover is advised.
Single parent families may decide to prioritise income protection or specified illness cover, followed by life cover.
For single professionals the priority must be income protection or specified illness cover, as state benefits are limited.
And for any self-employed people who fall into the ‘renters’ category, the social welfare benefits have improved as of December 2017, but are still quite onerous for claimants. They are capped for individuals at just over €10,000 per annum.
As we are all living longer we are increasingly likely to become ill or injured and unable to work during our working lives. Living protection is crucial for the renters’ generation. Speaking to a financial broker is key to future proofing your income and loved ones.
It looks increasingly likely that our society will have more long-term renters. If you take out a mortgage, you are obliged to take out mortgage protection (in the event of death the mortgage is cleared). You will also be encouraged to take out illness cover and income protection.
People must now apply the same principle while living as ‘the renters’ generation’.
Paul Kelly spoke at the ClearChoice Protection Summit for Financial Brokers on the gaps in protection for illness and injury should a person be unable to work or require medical treatment
ClearChoice is a training and support service for financial brokers. It advocates on behalf of the industry for protection in all forms, with more than 500 brokerages availing of ClearChoice’s services

Relatable study of grief and guilt let down by its romcom clichés

FICTION: Grace After Henry, By Eithne Shortall, Corvus, €16.45
Eithne Shortall’s Grace After Henry is an unusual mix, a blend of sex, death and a vague yet persistent sense of guilt which feels distinctly Irish. The follow-up to Shortall’s best-selling debut, 2017’s Love In Row 27 (the novel has already been translated into multiple languages and optioned for film), it begins with a bereavement: Grace loses Henry, the love of her life, in an accident when he is pulled under a truck while cycling along Dublin’s quays.
From its outset, Grace After Henry is an account of living with grief; slowly, Grace returns to work, reconnects with friends, and goes about renovating the house she bought with Henry shortly before he died. She is shocked to discover, as others have done while experiencing grief, that she sees her dead partner everywhere, only to look again and discover it’s not him.
Quickly, however, things take an unlikely turn; a plumber shows up on Grace’s doorstep with almost the exact same face, body and mannerisms as her late boyfriend. Another unlikely turn: he’s Henry’s long-lost twin brother Andy, separated at birth and shipped halfway across the world to be adopted, via an obscure religious order named St Patrick’s Guild. Faced with Henry’s handsome Australian clone, Grace is offered a troubling yet exhilarating choice: recreate the relationship which fate stole from her too soon, or come to terms with a strange new reality.
The plot races along through more dramatic twists, by turns relatable and utterly improbable, occasionally flippant and, eventually, rather poignant. In the acknowledgments Shortall describes her book as “entirely of Ireland”, but her version of Dublin is cloyingly quirky, a cast of caricatures tailor-made for a Richard Curtis film set in Stoneybatter.
Grace is surrounded by wisecracking elderly ladies, eccentric chip shop owners, token ‘sassy’ best friends and well-meaning but ditzy parents. They’re overkill, not least because the book’s central players – Grace, Andy, and the memory of Henry – are bland and colourless, defined only by the situations they face, or, in Henry’s case, by how much Grace reminds us that she loved him.
In Grace After Henry’s early chapters the tone sometimes feels inappropriately breezy, given its themes of heartbreak and death, but the plot redeems itself in its more macabre, uncomfortable moments. The first meeting of Andy and Henry’s mother is shocking and abrupt, a moment of awakening for Grace: ”You could only hear a scream like that once. It was the noise of a banshee, the sonographic expression of unspeakable sorrow . . . There were months of pain in that scream, and for the first time I considered that my own loss may not have been the greatest.”
There’s also a good deal of self-awareness amid the outlandish plot twists. Shortall’s characters make occasional reference to romcoms and histrionic daytime TV talk shows, and at one point Grace contemplates her future by saying: “If money got really tight, I could always book a slot on Ricki Lake or Jeremy Kyle or whichever of those chat shows where people got up out of chairs and pointed fingers at family members was still on the go. He’s No Baby Daddy . . . He’s My Baby Uncle.”
There are few things more disturbing than the idea of the doppelgänger, and the relationship between Andy and Grace is fittingly mercurial and tense. There are shades here of a far less cheerful story, a ‘chick lit’ Vertigo-in-reverse where a traumatised woman attempts to remake a stranger in the image of her dead boyfriend. There’s also potential for a new take on an old trope; for centuries, books written by men have lamented, fetishised and beatified absent dead women (think Dante’s Beatrice, Petrarch’s Laura, and various tubercular 19th-century muses), and the rise of a Dead Boyfriend Narrative is long overdue. It’s a shame, then, that Shortall doesn’t pursue Grace’s inner conflict further, embracing the morbid implications of her plot.
As it nears its close, Grace After Henry flirts with distinctly conservative, old-Ireland values concerning marriage and child-raising, before ultimately looking beyond them. What we’re left with is a mild romantic comedy cut with a certain darkness, and haunted by the possibility that it could have been much more.

Revealing the sixth

Highlight: Though we navigate life through our phones, we humans are hard-wired to relate to nature - we’ve just forgotten how to do it. In his new book Wild Signs and Star Paths: The Keys to Our Lost Sixth Sense, ‘Natural Navigator’ Tristan Gooley reveals how everyone can tap back into this ability and enjoy the outdoors in an exciting way - one which is both new and ancient. In this extract from his book, he suggests how we can begin to tune back into our relationship with nature, starting today 
Body


Have you ever felt you were being watched and later found out that you were right, but were unable to work out how you knew?
Imagine you are sitting in a café with your back to the window. You get a strange sense that someone behind you is looking at you. You may be right. If a friend is trying to catch your attention from the window of their car as they drive slowly past, this may register in the faces or body language of others in the café – perhaps the waiter looked up while pouring your coffee. Your friend’s call later that day confirms you were being watched.
Psychologists have proved that we can gauge the mood of a person at the other end of a telephone conversation extraordinarily well as soon as we hear their first word. Our ears hear it, but our brain rapidly draws on a lifetime’s experience, our knowledge of the character and situation of the caller, the time of day or night and a myriad other prompts to paint a much more inclusive picture than the word ‘hello’. All day and all night, the outdoors whispers single words full of deeper meaning to us. We have grown a little rusty at painting more than the outline of the picture.
A sixth sense is not mysterious: it is expert intuition, a honed ability to join the dots offered by our senses to complete a fuller picture of our environment. And there are a lot more dots than we are aware of. In the past second your senses have picked up 11 million pieces of information. It could take years to analyse all of them consciously, so almost all of that information is filtered out by your brain without troubling you. But if your brain picks up anything weird, wonderful or threatening, you will sense that something worthy of your attention is going on.
Nobody has considered what we are still capable of in nature. This is ironic, because the ability to judge situations intuitively springs from our need to survive in a wilder context.
Humanity has used this type of thinking to experience the outdoors for most of our history, and evolution has ensured that we would not exist without it. The early human who had to rely on laboured thought to work out what was going on around them was at a great disadvantage to one who sensed an enemy nearby, a dangerous predator behind them or a possible meal ahead.
I was once led deep underground by a BBC TV crew. We made our way, crouching, through dark, twisting tunnels into a cold slate mine in north Wales. There were no clues in our dank surroundings that were obvious to anyone in the crew, which was probably what prompted them to test me by asking if I could tell which way we were facing.
I peered at the damp rock, illuminated only by my head torch, then answered, “East.”
The safety consultant, who knew the mine intimately, confirmed that I was right, but admitted to being as mystified as the others by this ‘sixth sense’. After a few enjoyable minutes, I revealed that I had noticed the alignment of the grain of the slate, known as ‘dip’ to geologists. All sedimentary rocks begin as horizontal layers, but over millions of years, geological forces bend and tilt them; many end up with dramatic angles and these have trends. I’d seen that the slate surrounding us in the Welsh valley sloped up towards the south and used this to find our direction deep underground.
In that case I used a ‘clue’ consciously to answer a simple question. I have relied on this approach professionally for decades, and much of my writing has focused on this sort of logical, deductive thinking. However, something perhaps more interesting happens when the brain adopts the process and takes a shortcut. By the time we left the mine, everyone could sense direction instantly: it was reflected back at us in the slate. The idea that we might not have been able to do it was almost comical.
At the most basic level, we have not entirely lost these skills. Imagine you wake in a room that is perfectly dark, thanks to heavy curtains, and you hear a cockerel crowing outside. It may not take any conscious thought to appreciate that it is growing light outside. The dog’s bark at the usual time tells us that the postman is arriving.
But these examples are infantile compared to what our minds are capable of outdoors. My latest book, Wild Signs and Star Paths, is about our great ability in this area, which has been allowed to atrophy, almost forgotten and steamrollered by our modern lifestyle.
But how do we know it is retrievable?
Because a few individuals have held on to these skills, mainly those who have immersed themselves in the study of particular creatures or certain landscapes out of necessity or desire. Indigenous tribespeople all over the world, expert hunters and fishermen often retain extraordinary abilities and hold the torch to remind us of what is still possible.
I have sat with Dayak tribespeople as they explained that a deer would appear over the brow of a hill, and was amazed moments later when my eyes met those of a muntjac in the predicted spot. Only after careful discussion did it become clear that the Dayak were subconsciously tuned to the relationship between the salt on a rock, the bees, the water, the time of day and the clearing in the forest, all of which suggested that deer would come to lick salt at that time.
The Pygmy people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are used to hearing honey. They know that when honey is available the sound of a particular animal, related to the chameleon, changes slightly. They can also sense when they are being watched by a leopard. The physical clues are in the tracks on the ground, but a pedestrian study of them barely relates to predators in the forest. Instead they have learned to associate certain prints with an intimate understanding of the likely resting places of a leopard. Fresh ones near a typical leopard resting place spell danger. When they sense they are being watched, they are usually right.
Inuit hunters have a word, ‘quinuituq’, which means the deep patience needed when they are waiting for something to happen. Through it, they develop a relationship with the land that transcends crude analysis. The Arctic expert Barry Lopez described Inuit hunters as going beyond listening for animals or looking for their hoofprints. They ‘wore’ the landscape, like clothing, and engaged in a ‘wordless dialogue’ with it. It is important to emphasise that this is science, not mysticism. It is an ancient skill, not New Age, which we were all born to practise. Without any forecasts many people can tell when rain starts whether it will be a shower or a longer downpour.
They may struggle to explain it, but we grow accustomed to the changes in the sky that signify showers or otherwise. Our ancestors were tuned not only to broad changes in the landscape, but to finer ones, like the way the wood sorrel’s bright leaves fold up on the approach of rain.
A fisherman may predict the exact spot a trout will rise to the surface, but initially struggle to explain how. On later reflection she realises that her eyes and brain had worked together to notice that a cloud had blocked the sun. The black gnats had fallen out of the sky due to the lack of sunlight and the trout had come to the surface to feed. But the angler had sensed where the trout would surface.
Remnants of this ability can still be found in our relationship with domesticated animals. When you’re walking a dog in a city park it’s fairly easy to tell from the way it turns whether the person approaching from behind has a dog with them or not. Time spent enjoying this way of experiencing the outdoors helps us to begin rebuilding our lost sixth sense. And if we make this a regular part of our outdoors experience, we soon find that our brain takes over, forging shortcuts and allowing us to draw conclusions without conscious thought. We stop having to think through each step because our brains do it for us. We sense a dog behind us, and we sense that the weather will be fine tomorrow. It is only a small leap from that to sensing what we will find round a corner or what an animal will do next.
Journeys under stars and across oceans, forests and deserts have led me to the ultimate challenge: to gain a deep, intuitive understanding of my environment closer to home, a true sense of place.
Very little in our surroundings is random, and with a little practice we can learn to sense things that we may find astonishing. Understanding how and why this happens opens a new, and very old, way of experiencing our environment. It is a more radical experience of the outdoors than has been common for centuries.

Rich soil in which to grow your start-up

Highlight: Talent Garden aims to nurture small businesses, providing informal networking and mentoring in a hothouse environment, writes Quinton O’Reilly  
Body


With DCU Alpha on its side, Talent Garden aims to give businesses the resources they need in developing areas like IoT and AI when it launches later this year.
Come September, Talent Garden will be throwing its hat into the ring of co-working spaces designed for start-ups and corporations in the capital.
With its focus on new and emerging technologies sectors like Internet of Things (IoT), its partnership with DCU Alpha, the university’s innovation hub, is the kind of draw it hopes will bring in a good mix of start-ups and innovation labs from the larger corporations, said one of its local partners, Niall O’Connor.
“Given the fact that it’s one of, if not the fastest-growing digital sectors worldwide, there’s a huge amount of interest from a corporate and start up perceptive [in IoT],” said O’Connor. “With its location on DCU Alpha, I think we will naturally attract IoT-focused start-ups.
“From an innovation perspective, we are seeking to partner with IoT-focused organisations - that’s a corporation which has an interest in or is looking to develop other organisations and link up with an IoT perspective.
“That may be in the form of an innovation lab where they have a particular project that they’d wish to place within Talent Garden, to see partnerships within other IoT companies within Talent Garden but also within DCU Alpha.”
The focus for Talent Garden is wide-reaching, catering for single-founder start-ups through to SMEs and giving them the resources they need to develop their ideas and turn them into a viable business. Part of the appeal will be to create partnerships with larger corporations and turn it into a space for networking and sharing ideas.
It’s unlikely that a start-up will have the information they need to make all the right decisions, so the ability to connect with someone who has gone through the process and knows the pros and cons of specific choices is a plus.
On the IoT side of things, the focus goes beyond just providing a space for companies to work in, but one in which to create.
“Something DCU is in discussions with is the creation of an IoT maker space,” said O’Connell. “There’s a certain amount of a maker space there, but within Alpha there looks to be a prototype facility that will provide technical and prototyping equipment that will allow them to bring it from design to 3D printing through to prototyping.
“Those discussions are ongoing, but we suspect that within the next number of months, we’ll have something more tangible scoped out so, either within Talent Garden itself or the Alpha campus, we’ll have that set up quite quickly post our launch in September.”
The ultimate aim of Talent Garden is to let people focus on what their core is and to give the flexibility needed to help start-ups grow. Alongside that is the community focus, with workshops, seminars and classes based around different business areas to help start-ups improve their knowledge.
As part of that, Talent Garden is in talks with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to help provide support for those high-performing start-ups and creating the structures needed to link them with the necessary people and resources.
The connections expand to location as well, with Talent Garden in the process of opening a San Francisco office, something its Irish members can use to their advantage.
“The hardest thing from a start-up perspective is that they have an idea and are looking to develop it and have initial funding, but then [they have to deal with] administration, whether it’d be support around scaling or how to get funding,” he said.
“What the campus will do is lighten that load between the other companies that are there and the other corporates that are there as well.
“What experience tells us is that the corporates will look to provide not just support, but also provide partnership opportunities, there’s a proactive focus with the start-up communities because that’s where the next big ideas are likely to come out of.”
The potential scale of the IoT space is one reason why many large corporations such as Microsoft, Amazon and IBM are developing their own initiatives.
Likewise, the barrier separating businesses from IoT devices is starting to dissolve as the likes of Amazon Echo are popping up in the home.
For now, the space is in developing for its September launch.
Consisting of three floors featuring meeting room spaces, open plan workspaces and other facilities, O’Connor says it intends to be cheaper than what you would find in the city centre, with desk space for freelancers costing less than €200 per month and prices rising for facilities like private office space.
Yet it’s the community element, both within its building and outwards in areas like San Francisco, that O’Connor expects to be a major appeal for all businesses.
“For us, Talent Garden is about membership of the community as opposed to a desk rental, so the type of companies that will get the most out of it both from an IoT or a digital perspective will be those who will be looking to leverage [this],” he said.
“Yes, it provides a flexible workspace, yes it provides a stress-free environment . . . but it will also provide good networking opportunities, not just with events, but with companies that are there.”

Site with permission for 358 apartments guiding at €18m

Savills is guiding in excess of €18 million for a site with planning permission for 358 apartments on the Swords Road in Dublin 9. The 6.75 acre site also includes planning permission for just over 800 square metres of commercial accommodation.
The site is within a ten-minute drive of Dublin Airport and Dublin City University and St Patrick’s College are all within walking distance. It is some 4km north of the city centre and about 2km south of the M50 motorway.
In terms of public transport, the site is well served by ten Dublin Bus services along the QBC to the front of the site. The new Metro North subway is planned to stop at Griffith Avenue, about 1.5km from the property, making it even more accessible.
The site is also close to the well-established Omni Shopping Centre in Santry.
Planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála on 22 December, 2011 for 358 apartments accommodated in between five and seven-storey blocks. A feasibility study undertaken by Fenton and Associates Architects shows potential to increase the number of units, without necessarily increasing the total gross floor area, to more than 400 apartments (subject to the necessary planning consents).
Vehicular access is provided for via the Swords Road and the planning permission allows for 105 surface car parking spaces and 413 at basement level.
Ground floor commercial accommodation is also provided for, in addition to a creche contained within a two-storey building located in the northern end of the site.
John Swarbrigg of Savills said: “This is an exceptionally well-located site, and given the significant scale on offer, it is ideally suited for both the private and rental market upon completion.
Dublin is still very much in a period of undersupply when it comes to residential property – and apartments in particular – therefore we expect strong demand from investors and developers.”
According to the latest research from Savills, the vacancy in Dublin’s private rented sector has been below 2 per cent for almost four years, which is significantly below the natural vacancy rate (NVR) – estimated to be 5.3 per cent. According to the agent, if the vacancy remains below the NVR, rents will continue to rise.

Highlight: Memoir, fiction, no matter, Sheila Heti's Motherhood bristles with brutal, assured honesty.
Body


MEMOIR/FICTION: Motherhood, By Sheila Heti, Harvill Secker, €19.55
The Canadian author of seven books, Sheila Heti’s name was made by How Should a Person Be?, her 2012 meditation on life, art and personal ambition. That book garnered praise for its form-flouting style and so it abides with Motherhood. Here, we have another diarised outpouring, a navel gaze, that sees the narrator interrogate a single, urgent dilemma: to become a mother or not to become a mother?
Motherhood follows the narrator’s progression through the wonder years for many women – the ages between 36 and 40 when a decision to reproduce or otherwise must, it feels, be made. The narrator is a writer, divorced, privileged, and in a relationship with a man named Miles, whom she deeply loves and who has a daughter from a prior relationship. Theirs is an enviably erotic coupling, with Miles coming across as the ideally intelligent and supportive partner. Better yet, he’s ambivalent to the point of resistant on the question of kids. “Miles liked me as I was,” writes the narrator, “I - even without bringing forth a baby - was enough.” And so, importantly so, is the personal obligation to choose accentuated.
Is Motherhood a novel? A memoir? Neither, and both? Its author has said that “much of my own thoughts are the narrator’s, but there are differences in our lives.” In common with the narrator, Heti is 41, a ‘non-mother’, and a writer, so it goes.
Chapters mimic the menstrual cycle – Ovulating, PMS, Follicular and so on. Fitting, then, is the pain and the relief of reading the book. Painful aspects include the ‘coin-flip’ passages, where, practicing the I Ching, the narrator poses a random series of tiresome questions to a coin, to be met with tiresomely random responses, in hope of “an interruption of my complacency” (these interludes may delight some, but not this reader). There’s the narrator’s description of her dreams, her visits to tarot readers and the real-world action taken on mystical advice tendered, plus the irregular insertions of a picture of a knife, stray dog, or a cocoon.
These read as privileged, bourgeois (“So much money I gave her [the tarot reader], as she stood behind me at the ATM”), as does the wider world the writer inhabits, one populated by beautiful friends named Libby who can’t get enough dim sum. What feels most indulgent, however, is to spend four years cogitating on whether to have a child or not, and this protracted introspection will test the patience of the pragmatic reader. Just decide, one may silently shout. Get pregnant, or, you know, don’t. This dilemma is hardly new for women.
And there, right there, is the relief, and the beating heart of Motherhood. Each page says: why not spend endless hours on this predicament? Isn’t it appropriate for the modern, right-thinking woman to hash out every possible eventuality, every philosophical, psychological and practical implication of motherhood? Isn’t motherhood versus non-motherhood one of the most vital and interesting questions of our age?
Overdue statements abound. “There is a kind of sadness in not wanting the things that give so many other people their life’s meaning,” Heti writes. Elsewhere: “A woman will always be made to feel like a criminal, whatever choice she makes, however hard she tries. Mothers feel like criminals. Non-mothers do, too.” There’s the deliciously Dorothy Parker-esque: “Only when a woman is no longer attractive to men, can she be left alone for enough moments to actually think.”
And there’s the glaringly necessary: “Being a woman, you can’t just say you don’t want a child. You have to have some big plan or idea of what you’re going to do instead. And it better be something great.”
This book asks important questions. Does motherhood dampen art? Is creating art as good as, or perhaps better than, creating a child? Do women have babies because men, social order and an ancient impetus demand it so? Do women have babies to parry a deeper ambition for, or a basic dedication to, themselves? Do women become mothers because they’re too frightened not to?
In an Irish context, Heti’s provocation is timely, too. “It’s like with abortion,” says Miles, “they think they can tell you what to do with your body. Men want to control women’s lives by forbidding them to have abortions, while women try to control other women’s bodies by pressuring them to have kids.”
Memoir, fiction, no matter, Motherhood bristles with brutal, assured honesty. Heti is a member of the f*** you, I-won’t-write-how-you-tell-me school that includes the Irish writer Sally Rooney. “I don’t think books have to be liked or disliked,” Heti said recently. “They’re part of our mental landscape. Either you want a book to be part of your mental landscape or you don’t.”
What Motherhood boils down to is a woman’s freedom to choose: how she thinks, how she works, how she lives, how she procreates, or how she does not. (Together for) Yes to that.

Highlight: Conferencing software is now used by researchers  in 58 countries 
Body


In the six years since it began trading in early 2012, conferencing software developed by Galway company Ex Ordo has been used by 350,000 researchers in 58 countries.
The Ex Ordo platform has been used by the organisers of more than 850 research conferences worldwide and is now set for further growth under a new global partnership with US mobile app company Guidebook.
It is a far cry from the company’s origins as a side project for founder and chief executive Paul Killoran, who was then running the web application consultancy Starlight.
“My old college supervisor was organising a conference and he wanted me to look at software to help him manage it,” said Killoran.
“I was really disappointed by the software that was available at the time and I foolishly believed I could build a better system in two weeks.
“I spent the next six months working on the project and I was very proud of what I’d developed by the time the conference came round, but I swore I never wanted to see the software again.
“A month later, another conference organiser asked to use my software and I realised I had a product I could resell again and again.”
The Ex Ordo platform manages conference scheduling, registration fees and the research review process. It costs from €3,000 per event for a software license.
“We have two types of competitors,” said Killoran. “There are generalists or large software companies that provide software for every kind of event like conferences, seminars and trade shows.
“Then there are small companies that have been around for ten to 20 years. They understand the needs of researchers, but they are underfunded and dated.
“Ex Ordo is the only company that provides enterprise-grade software for the research conference community.
Killoran runs Ex Ordo with co-founders Dermot Lally, who is head of sales at the company, and chief technology officer Mike Rockall.
“We’ve spent years developing and perfecting our product, value proposition and pricing and now we’ve shifted into scaling mode,” said Killoran.
“It’s all about building a global brand that is recognised and used by every researcher on the planet.”
Ex Ordo employs 14 people and is a client company of state agency Enterprise Ireland (EI).
“The project initially with a grant from the Galway Local Enterprise Office and a bank loan,” said Killoran.
“We secured €50,000 through EI’s Competitive Startup Fund in 2013. Then they, along with some private investors, invested a substantial sum in Ex Ordo in 2017.”

Irish production company Element Pictures is expecting a blockbuster year ahead as it is working on two films with a combined budget of over $30 million.
Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe from Element will produce The Nest alongside FilmNation Entertainment and BBC Films. It will feature well-known actors Jude Law, whose upcoming movies include Fantastic Beasts and Captain Marvel, and Carrie Coon, who has starred in The Post and Fargo. The psychological thriller, financed by FilmNation and BBC Films, has a $10 million budget.
It will be directed and written by Sean Durkin, who also worked on Martha Marcy May Marlene. In the film, Law’s character Rory moves his American wife and children to England to explore new business opportunities but life in their country manor takes a turn for the worse. UTA will handle US sales while FilmNation is handling international sales, starting at this month’s Cannes Film Festival.
Guiney said: “We are so pleased to see our new film The Nest coming together with the addition of Jude Law to the cast. The film shoots in Canada and Britain this autumn.”
Another Element film, The Favourite, has just been given a prime awards season release date of November 23, Thanksgiving in the US, by Fox Searchlight, which was previously responsible for Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri.
With a budget of $20 million, The Favourite was directed by The Lobster’s Yorgos Lanthimos and stars La La Land’s Emma Stone, The Deep Blue Sea’s Rachel Weisz, and The Iron Lady’s Olivia Colman with Irishman Robbie Ryan as cinematographer.
Meanwhile, Blinder Films has secured funding from Belgium-based uMedia for its latest film, provisionally entitled Extra Ordinary. The comedy will star comedian Maeve Higgins as a driving instructor who must use her supernatural gifts to save a lonely man’s daughter from an ageing rock star looking to use her for satanic sacrifice.

Talking politics in the workplace

On Friday, voters will be asked if they want to repeal article 40.3.3 – known as the Eighth Amendment. The reaction to this announcement has already made political discussion in the workplace nearly inescapable.
It’s natural for colleagues to talk about current affairs, but how far should political discussion in the workplace go before it begins to threaten morale?
Unfortunately, it is difficult to prevent political discussions at work; however, it is important that employers remind employees to be respectful.
Political views are a personal matter that is often deeply held and this can lead to discussions turning confrontational and personal. This is particularly the case when it comes to the Eighth Amendment.
Employers need to ensure that employees are aware of what is, and isn’t, acceptable to say in the workplace regarding politics to reduce the risk of political discrimination taking place.
Some employers may want to apply a total ban on employees talking about politics in the workplace. This could reduce the likelihood of heated discussions arising and maintain a positive working environment.
However, employers may find it difficult to enforce such a policy, and disciplining employees for discussing political views may cause further tension.
With that in mind, it is advised that employers take a more pragmatic approach and make employees aware that they should be mindful of the sensitivities of others and to ensure that any talk is respectful.
In the current climate, employers need to be alert more than ever to employees harassing colleagues via political beliefs. For example, it was well documented in Britain that the Brexit referendum led to increased harassment against people of different nationalities.
Political talk can offend others, particularly because comments and opinions on the Eighth Amendment will often mean that topics like gender and religion take centre stage in these discussions.
Because these conversations are likely to leak into the workplace, it is important for employers to have in place an anti-harassment policy that communicates the employer’s expectations about appropriate workplace behaviour.
The wearing or displaying of political symbols in the workplace should be discouraged as it could have many negative implications on colleagues or customers.
For example, if an employee has contact with customers you might want to introduce a policy that the wearing or displaying of all political items is unacceptable.
Such a policy needs to apply equally to all members of staff and be justified by a sound business reason to ensure no unlawful indirect discrimination is taking place.
Individuals are increasingly turning to social media to express their personal opinions, and these posts can become heated and hostile. Employers should consider implementing policies to prevent employees from using workplace social media or the employer’s IT equipment to harass their colleagues or attribute personal opinions to their employer.

The logistics of delivering the best efficiencies

The next wave of IoT devices will help deliver greater efficiencies in traditional industries, none more so than with logistics.
Based in Co Cavan, Virginia, International Logistics has been growing steadily since it was founded 35 years ago.
The family-run company has gone from strength to strength - it doubled its turnover in the past five years and is experiencing strong growth year-on-year - and is in the midst of a major expansion that will turn it into a one-stop shop for freight forwarding, warehousing and other services.
With experience in Britain and mainland Europe, its expansion will include Internet of Things (IoT) initiatives that will keep it at the forefront, says its logistics director Gerry Murphy.
“As part of our expansion and ongoing approach, we’re looking to and we’re developing our logistics function to offer a one-stop shop [for customers],” he said.
“The new facility will consist of 50,000 square foot which is phase one, which has a pallet capacity of around 10,300 pallets, state-of-the-art facilities operating to a high standard with full office, meeting room, services on site, full EDI warehouse management system, telescopic loading bays, basically, these are more state-of-the-art ones which allows you to open and close doors on the bays without having to take trucks off.”
While phase one will allow for a significant expansion, which will be operational by late June, it will have the option of going through further phases with a potential phase two adding another 60,000 square foot on the same site.
If the right clients come along and the situation requires it, it has room to go through another expansion that would bring it up to 180,000 square foot in full.
For a company that specialises in food, electronics and pharmaceuticals across Britain and Europe, such an expansion is crucial and so too are the technological innovations that come with it.
The logistics industry is always changing and so it must move with the times so it can give its clients the service they’re looking for, not just in the warehouses, but in its transport too.
“From Virginia’s point of view, it’s to offer a one-stop shop,” he said. “It’s a full complement to all the services that we can offer to our clients. Its part of our ongoing three-year expansion and it’s bringing it into the next level.
“Logistics and supply chains are always evolving day by day and we’re working to keep up with new technologies. We have all of our new technology on our trucks with tracking systems; we are in the middle of a gas project where we’re introducing gas trucks on the road to help reduce our carbon footprint so we’re working heavily with the gas companies on that as well.
“There’s a whole manner of different things and the logistics warehouse is just one section of that.”
The trucks themselves are fitted with a whole assortment of smart devices to help with management and maintaining services. On top of full fuel utilisation - it’s one of the first companies here to bring in gas trucks which are easier to operate than diesel ones and emit less pollution - it comes equipped with full track and trace systems through the use of Blue Tree Systems, which specialises in helping companies track large and mid-sized fleets.
By giving both the company and individual drivers the autonomy to do inspections and keep track of everything that’s happening, it allows for greater efficiencies in the long run.
“We can also read from point A of loading to point B of delivering and show them the full temperature of a fridge unit from A to B and give them the full downloads on arrival,” he said. “They can take it, accept it in, clear it and it’s back into that warehouse as well so it’s a full top-of-the-range Blue Tree system which gives us full functionality.”
As mentioned before, the focus is all about efficiency and ensuring that all advantages are utilised. Supply chains and delivery systems aren’t going to disappear anytime soon, but you still have to keep an eye on what’s coming down the line, something Murphy is aware of.
“It’s all about being up to date with the most modern technology that’s there,” said Murphy. “[It’s to] keep right on the front of demand with customers as you grow throughout the industry, keep on top of the supply chain and keep one step ahead.
“It’s to ensure full utilisation of manpower, equipment, resources and services and to offer a full complement of services with immediate reporting — on demand, downloads, whatever they require.
“The review of your business is an ongoing, daily thing. It’s always about a continuous strive for new technology, the latest thing that can keep you as efficient as possible, both from a service provider and operational point of view.”

The state: the biggest, baddest land hoarder of them all

Highlight: In Dublin, the state controls 70 per cent of zoned residential land. Could a sell-off hold the key to a functional market? 
Body


People sometimes think developers are all in cahoots with one another, but anybody who knows a developer knows that isn’t the case. They may have to work together and get along, but it is very much a competitive environment where they will undercut one another to seal a deal or get ahead.
There is another big operator in the land market which cannot say the same about itself, and that’s the state. There is no branch of the state which typically comes out and says it’s willing to undercut and compete with another state branch.
When the single largest land owner in the nation (the state) holds so much land, it’s curious that we don’t call its huge market influence into question, because the state could, from tomorrow, lower the cost of housing in a myriad of ways.
We won’t even get started on levies, taxes, red tape and connection fees for hooking up water. We’ll just look at raw material costs.
The raw material in development is land. There is no shortage of it, not even in Dublin where we have a never-ending housing crisis.
According to architect Mel Reynolds, the state controls more than 3,000 hectares, or almost 7,500 acres, of zoned land. At a semi-D density of 14 to the acre that would be more than 100,000 homes.
A single entity is controlling almost one fifth of the zoned residential land in Ireland, and more than 25 per cent of all potential dwellings (land and dwellings are not a 1:1 ratio).
The National Asset Management Agency (Nama) is the biggest, followed by Local Authorities (LAs). In Dublin, where problems are most pronounced, Nama has land that could hold 43,000 homes and LAs could hold 30,000 homes.
In the capital, the state is in control of 70 per cent of zoned residential land. That is a hugely dominant market position, one that if occupied by anybody else would be a source of daily headlines.
So what do we do? Bring in a fairly lame-duck vacant site levy. Dublin City Council features prominently on the Dublin City vacant sites list. It shows up more than that of any private landholder.
When it starts to fine itself, as illogical as that may seem, it won’t create housing. That is why it would be better off selling land to drive down prices.
There are vested interests that would scream murder at the thought of this, having paid so heavily for sites around the city, but at some stage we have to accept that government policy is for those that are governed, not for serving the better interests of lobbyists and those who made certain business decisions in the past.
If local authorities and Nama decided that, from tomorrow, they would auction off five acres of development land every day it would take them at least six years to sell what they have right now. Of course, they could turn off the spigot at any time, but a move like this would make development for smaller builders a possibility.
As it stands the country has only a handful of big construction firms, they win all the contracts, they get all the large jobs, they are in part kept afloat courtesy of the state.
When markets fail, losers are meant to lose so that winners can win. Via Nama and other means we kept the losers alive so they can become the winners all over again. That isn’t much solace to those seeking their own place at the top table.
The trade off of keeping land prices high is that incumbents get rich, the problems we have persist and we remain reliant on a small number of housing creators.
If we unleashed the full potential of all house builders via a guaranteed supply of cheap land we could devalue all homes around Dublin, and as much as I hate to say it, that’s what has to happen. Supply has to kill off demand and speculation.
Some people won’t be happy about that. Their joy is not our concern, a functional market is. Function implies supply availability.
You can’t have affordable homes for some while house prices remain elevated for others, those are incompatible objectives. Housing wealth that comes from nowhere is unearned and generally untaxed, this is a mistake and it comes at a cost. The cost is that houses remain out of reach of many young people and it has huge knock-on effects for them and locks them out of future wealth.
A developer once told me that “the price of land doesn’t matter. We have to buy it or we are out of business, the same as a trucker has to buy diesel”. If that’s the case, then the biggest land hoarder of them all should be encouraged into rapid delivery of land supply.
For those who fear it would be a ‘give away’ just remember, the state has the ability to tax that land. Value will be recouped and future property tax created, something that current vacant state land can’t match.
That means giving councils and local authorities targets. It means taking the bold step of firing people or shutting down departments that underperform.
The alternative, and the path we seem to be most comfortable with, is a mixture between ground-hog day and the status quo, where we are constantly told ‘We are doing all we can and have all these new plans . . .’ and yet nothing seems to change.

Tiny measures making a big difference

Highlight: Counting flowers for bees or writing letters to sick children are just two of the charitable activities that people can take a few minutes out of their busy lives to do to help others. Arlene Harris reports on the new trend of micro volunteering 
Body


Last week was National Volunteer Week, when people all over the country dedicated their time to helping others in need or did their bit for the local environment.
However, while most people like doing something for the good of the wider community, not everyone has the time to devote several hours a week to cleaning rubbish from their local park, visiting the sick in hospital or even preparing a meal for someone who is old and alone.
But in our time-poor society, a new wave of altruism is emerging: micro volunteering. This is a means of encouraging people to take on small but meaningful tasks which may seem insignificant, but can make a great difference to either another person or the world as a whole.
There is a selection of ideas on makeaminute.ie, including counting flowers, which may seem like a pointless and almost hippy-dippy thing to do, but is actually of vital importance to the dwindling population of bees which could affect the entire planet.
Count Flowers for Bees was originally set up as part of a research project funded by the Irish Research Council to determine which habitats provided the best floral research for bees.
Jane Stout, principal investigator on the project, explains why it’s so important. “Bees rely on flowers for food for their whole life cycle and a loss of wild flowers is a major contributor to bee decline – in fact, one-third of our Irish bee species [99 different types in total] are threatened with extinction,” she says. “Bees are important because as they forage for nectar and pollen and move pollen between flowers, this results in seeds and fruits being produced.
“This benefits crop production [especially for fruits such as apples, strawberries and raspberries, which are key to a healthy diet]. It’s also really important for wild plants – nearly 90 per cent of all flowering plant species globally benefit from animal pollination – and these fuel ecosystems, provide food for other wildlife, play key roles in carbon and other nutrient cycles and create the beautiful countryside for everyone to enjoy.”
Understanding what causes bee decline and helping to reverse it are the aims of the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan, and volunteers can help by simply counting flowers.
“We wanted to create a map of the best places for bees in Ireland and couldn’t survey the whole island for flowers, so got photos of different habitat types from across the country, and asked ‘citizen scientists’ to help us count the flowers on those photos,” says Stout, a professor in botany. “So we can identify hotspots for bees and areas that aren’t so good. This can help inform land management to promote bees and other flower-visiting insects.
“It can take a minute or an hour, but everyone who counts flowers helps us to understand the world around us a bit more – allowing us to make a difference in managing it for the benefit of everyone – people, plants and bees alike. It’s really simple and you don’t need any expertise, just visit the website, click on ‘get started’ and follow the instructions.”
Reading instructions is something that most of us take for granted, but if someone has problems with their eyesight, putting together the simplest of appliances may seem like an impossible feat. This is where another ingenious example of micro-volunteering comes into play.
Be My Eyes is a simple app which allows visually impaired people to make video calls to sighted people, who can talk them through an everyday task. Established in Denmark in 2012 by Hans-Jørgen Wiberg, this basic technology came about when a friend of the founder told him how he used video calls so family members could assist with small issues.
The app is now used in more than 180 countries worldwide making it the biggest global online community for the visually-impaired as well as one of the largest micro-volunteering platforms in the world. Every day, volunteers lend their eyes to solve tasks, big and small, to help others be more independent.
Alexander Hauerslev Jensen of the organisation says this simple yet effective idea benefits both the user and the volunteer.
“Be My Eyes enables blind and visually impaired people to lead a more independent life by giving access to a network of sighted volunteers,” he says. “At the tap of a button, our users connect to a sighted volunteer, who will provide them with visual assistance for the task at hand at any time of the day, from anywhere – and it will always be free.
“And for the volunteer, helping out is both a very important, natural and gratifying part of being human – we are built to help each other and sometimes we need a small reminder to do it.
“One of our users once tweeted us and said: ‘Be My Eyes is a good deed waiting to happen in your pocket’, and I think that is very true. The ease of volunteering over the phone lowers the barrier to getting started and the impact is huge both for how it makes the volunteers feel and for the blind and visually impaired users, who get a task solved. “
Joanne Whelan from Waterford agrees, and says that although she has only taken a handful of calls from partially sighted or blind people, it has been wonderful to know that she has “genuinely made a difference”.
“I have been a member of the Be My Eyes community since November 2016 and have taken around five or six calls to assist people,” says the 24-year-old. “Some of the calls are as easy as giving the date on a carton of soup, or as hard as diagnosing a technical issue with a Windows computer that won’t start. So a call can last as long or as short a time as is necessary to resolve the issue.
“It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to know I can help someone by simply answering a call and guiding them to resolve a problem, no matter how big or small. And I really think more people should take the time to help, as the more sighted volunteers they are, the better it is for the community.”
Derek Ryan of Dúchas also has ideas on how we can all help our local and national community. The organisation is responsible for digitising Ireland’s folklore collection – which is amazingly the biggest collection of its kind in the world – and is looking for volunteers to simply type up stories which were written in schools in the 1930s and need to be preserved for future generations to enjoy.
[caption id="attachment_416678" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Derek Ryan, Dúchas The Heritage Service, at the former County Gaol in Nenagh Pic: John D Kelly[/caption]
“The Irish Folklore Scheme was started by UCD almost a century ago in order to record history under different headings,” says Ryan. “The hard copies were held for a long time at the university and then put onto micro-films so people could view them in local libraries. The stories, which were handwritten by school children, now need to be transcribed so everyone has access to them.
“Anyone can volunteer as the scanned pages are online, so all people have to do is call up a page and type it out into an adjacent box. They can give as much or as little time as they want, even just typing out a page at a time – but whatever amount of help they offer will make a huge difference to the preservation of our heritage. And the best thing is, there is a lot of undiscovered stuff in there, so it can be hugely rewarding to anyone who has an interest in history.”
While writing out stories documented by children of another era is a great way of doing your bit to preserve our heritage, taking time to write to the children of today can make the world of difference to their lives.
Set up in 2002 by a group of teenagers in Britain, Post Pals makes use of the old-fashioned but always special concept of receiving mail.
When Vicki George was severely unwell and in isolation she found that the only thing that made her smile was receiving cards or gifts in the post so she and her peers set up a group to encourage volunteers to write to children who are sick or in hospital.
“The idea behind Post Pals is very simple, and the website features children with a forwarding address, their interests and their story,” says Ally Hawthorne. “Members of the public from across the globe can then send cheerful post – it only takes a few minutes to write a short message, but will bring a huge smile to a seriously ill child’s face.  Or a volunteer can commit to regularly writing to a child or regularly sending a parcel. This sort of contact is invaluable to sick children, as they just love to hear from other people.”
All of the Post Pals children are aged between three and 17 with a life-threatening illness or disability and, while sending a card sounds like such a simple idea, for some of those children it can be life-changing.
“For a child in isolation while having cancer treatment, these cards may be their only contact with the outside world,” says Hawthorne. “They can cover the walls of the isolation rooms with cards and the room quickly changes from being a white, cold, cancer ward into a colourful, magical, child’s room.
“As a mum myself, I know how busy life can be and some days I feel I hardly have time to take a breath, but each week I put aside 5-10 minutes to sit quietly and write to a child. It gives me a lovely warm glow knowing that once I pop that letter in the postbox, a few days later a child somewhere will be smiling because of those five minutes I took out of my day.”
The new trend of micro-volunteering is one that transcends gender, age and social status. Laura Erskine of parenting site Mummypages.ie encourages people to take 60 seconds out of their daily lives and register with makeaminute.ie, as it could make all the difference.
“We are encouraging everyone to get involved and make a positive contribution to the disabled, the environment, sick children, endangered animals and society as a whole,” she says. “Microvolunteering enables those that simply can’t find the time to volunteer to do so with as little as just one minute of their time.
“We are all searching for more meaning in our lives, yet so many of us are trapped by the demands placed on us by work and family. The ‘Make a Minute’ campaign pioneers the concept of doing good for others and is one that is often forgotten in our busy day-to-day lives.
“So whether you are standing in line at the bank or waiting for a bus, take a minute to make a difference.”

Highlight: Victor Waddington’s keen eye for great art netted him numerous gems over the years, among them a beauty by Jack B Yeats, which leads Whyte’s sale 
Body


Where would Irish art be in the 21st century without the prescient eye of the late Victor Waddington? So often the cream of Irish headline lots originated from his galleries. A case in point leads Whyte’s sale next week: Morning Glory by Jack B Yeats.
First purchased from Waddington in 1945, it depicts two travellers on a deserted cobbled street, one exhausted, sits on his suitcases, the other turns his face into the first beam of dawn sunlight. Glory is used in the titles of several of Yeats’s late works. In this case it references the spiritual aura on the face of the man in the foreground. Measuring 35.56 x 45.72, it is expected to realise €80,000-€120,000.
Another Waddington protégé was Daniel O’Neill, whose Maternity may be a precursor to The First Born, 1949, now in the Collection of the National Museums Northern Ireland, 40.64×50.80 (€15,000-€20,000).
Paul Henry’s stunning Killary Bay makes its debut at auction in its simple, original frame. It was acquired by descent from the present owner’s grandfather, an amateur artist who painted with Henry in the west of Ireland. One of his earliest depictions of a sailing boat, it was probably painted soon after his arrival on Achill, 35.56×40.64 (€50,000-€70,000).
A second Henry work, Western Skies, depicts Irish bogland on a grey day, 50.8×61cm (€50,000-€70,000). In addition, there’s a quartet of gouache sketches that include the risqué Apollo. These most likely date from Henry’s student days in Paris, and each is 22.9×10.2cm (€8,000-€12,000).
Other highlights include William Conor’s Exercising the Greyhounds, which captures the thrill experienced by owners of these handsome creatures, 73.03×60.33cm (€15,000-€20,000), and Sea Horses by Patrick Hennessy – can there be any more delightful prospect than riding bareback on the dunes? Measuring 40.64×63.75cm, it has an estimate of €5,000-€7,000.
In An Important Letter, 1882, Sarah Purser portrays what was once part and parcel of everyday life: a trip to the postbox, 35.6×30.48cm (€3,000-€5,000). A tradition still extant is the public park as a place to enjoy fresh air and good company, as in Patrick Leonard’s A Quiet Chat, 40.64×50.80cm (€1,500-€2,000).
A collection of works spanning Harry Kernoff’s career was formed by the Segal family, Ireland’s largest manufacturer of medals including those for the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence. The archive includes the halcyon watercolour Sun Terrace, Dún Laoghaire Pier, 1931, 26.67×38.74cm (€3,000-€5,000), plus woodcuts, portraits and a 1960 foray into abstraction, Floating Cubes, 20.32×15.24cm (€800-€1,000).

Highlight: Acclaimed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels always thinks BIG - literally – while running a firm that’s at the very cutting edge of contemporary design. He was in Dublin recently to expound on his creative vision 
Body


The expression ‘go big or go home’ seems to sum up the career and remarkable portfolio of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, dubbed an architectural wunderkind and generally considered a big deal in the world of contemporary architecture and design.
The head of Bjarke Ingels Group, or BIG, was in Dublin earlier this month to speak at the Irish Foundation’s series of New Now Next lectures, where he captured the imagination and full attention of the 500 or so architects and designers gathered at the O’Reilly Theatre.
The energetic 43-year-old is behind Google’s new Silicon Valley headquarters at Mountain View in California, the same firm’s London HQ at King’s Cross, the world’s first eco-friendly waste-to-energy power plant with an artificial Alpine ski slope on the roof in Copenhagen, Denmark’s Lego House museum, Manhattan island’s new flood defence system, and e-car and e-stations for Elon Musk’s supersonic transport system Hyperloop in Dubai.
Embracing the space race, Ingels is also on a mission to Mars, at the invitation of the United Arab Emirates. In the desert outside Dubai, he is designing and building the Mars Science City, a space simulation campus focused on creating a viable living environment on the Red Planet. He also charmed the Danish government into allowing him to ‘borrow’ the country’s iconic Little Mermaid sculpture and exhibit her at the 2010 Shanghai Expo for six months. That’s just a taste of what he does.
In Dublin to explore the role of architects in society, he said: “It helps if you are passionate about what you do.
If you’re trying to do things even a little differently, you will encounter so much resistance, that if you don’t love what you do, it’s very easy to back down and go with the flow.
“The Danish word for design means to give shape to something that has not yet been given form. Whenever there is transformation, be it cultural, climate, technology, social, environmental, whatever, it means that society, which has been organised or designed for what was, greets the changes almost like cracks in the official structure.
“If, as architects, we pay attention to where the change is happening, we are given the possibility to form the future we’d like to live in. As architects, we often try to identify what information we need to acquire to be able to make informed design decisions.”
Ingels cites a number of examples, including a sports hall at his former secondary school in Copenhagen and a number of museums in Denmark, Norway and Switzerland with exceptionally awkward locations or conditions attached.
“My old maths teacher commissioned us to design a handball sports hall, with only two potential areas to build on: the football field – which was out of the question – and the students’ courtyard social space. We had no choice but to bury the structure. When you start digging, it becomes progressively more expensive the deeper you go, so we designed the geometry of the roof according to the formula for a ballistic arch.”
As though it had been traced, the graceful curved design conveniently corresponded with rules of handball, which dictate a 4.5-metre clear perimeter and a clear height of 7.5 metres in the middle of the hall. The now sloping courtyard on the roof also saw three times as much use by the students.
Another example of where circumstances dictated the design is BIG’s composition for a museum it was commissioned to create beside a German bunker from World War II on the west coast of Denmark, in the middle of a listed dune landscape. Again, Ingels went underground.
“The concept of the museum was as an incision into the dunes. As you approach you slowly discover the building sunken into the landscape. And even though it is entirely underground, it’s capable of drawing in an abundance of natural daylight. It was formed out of a necessity to be discreet in a beautiful landscape, but also a desire not to compete with the beauty of the bunker,” he said.
[caption id="attachment_416750" align="alignleft" width="444"] Bjarke Ingels[/caption]
Similar restrictions applied for the design of the Maritime Museum of Denmark next to Kronborg Castle on the Unesco world heritage site at Helsingor, or Elsinor, in 2013. The solution was again subterranean, locating the new museum uniquely within a former shipping dry dock with a series of linked bridges drawing visitors down into the light-filled space.
Another bridge design was for a small art museum in a small sculpture park in Norway, where Ingels was invited to propose the location of the museum. “Sculptures ran along both sides of a river that runs through the park, so we thought: ‘What if the museum could be the bridge that takes you from one side to the other?’ Part of the experience is that, from some angles, it doesn’t look like a building but like a sculpture in itself.
“Once you identify what the main problem is, or its greatest potential, you haven’t found the answer, all you have found is the question. To get there, you have to go through this process, testing, crafting different attempts, each attempt becomes a step in the process that leads you to the answer.”
Inspired by the 150-year-old workshop and craftsmanship of luxury Swiss watchmaking client Audemars Piguet, BIG’s design for a watchmaking museum was to create a spiralling gallery designed to take visitors on a chronological exhibition culminating at the central and largest gallery.
The sculpturally beautiful building has a roof that follows the slope of the valley, which lets in light and stunning views, but also lacks a single column throughout the building.
“One of the main disciplines of watchmaking is to make the maximum impact with the minimum of material. So that’s why some of the disciplines of watchmaking is miniaturisation, making gears as small and flat as possible to create a light timepiece,” said Ingels.
“In this case, we thought we could minimise the structure by using glass. Glass is stronger than steel when it comes to compression, but it is very poor at tension. In an earthquake, it buckles and breaks. But because it curves, the curvature adds rigidity like an arch, allowing us to use glass to build in a seismic zone in La Vallée de Joux carrying the roof entirely in glass like a spring hovering above the gallery spaces.”
The spiral walkway curving down to a central gallery space featured at BIG’s Denmark Pavilion at Shanghai Expo 2010. The architects found a common cultural denominator in that the Chinese public school curriculum incorporates three fairytales by Hans Christian Andersen, including the tale of the Little Mermaid. Despite legal interventions by the Danish Nationalist Party, Ingels convinced the country’s parliament to let their Little Mermaid travel to Shanghai for six months.
“In her absence, we invited the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei to make an installation. He installed a Chinese surveillance camera in the pavilion transmitting a live TV feed to where the Mermaid normally sits in Copenhagen, so tourists could see that she was fine, just in another time zone. It was possibly the only uncensored TV feed in China for six months,” smiles Ingels.
In a corresponding show of goodwill, the Chinese government donated two pandas to the queen of Denmark, and BIG is building them a compound at Copenhagen Zoo.
Two other landmark projects of note closer to Ingels’ home include the Lego House in Billund and the Amager Bakke Waste-to-Energy Plant in Copenhagen.
“Who knew that playing with Lego as a child would develop into a dream job?” he muses. “Our office in Copenhagen [a former Carlsberg factory, which Ingels quips is “probably the best office in the world”] is filled with Lego.
[caption id="attachment_416748" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Danish Expo Pavilion 2010[/caption]
“We make a lot of models as architects, and we use Lego to do it. We were approached five years ago by Lego to build the Lego House, where visitors could experience a building surrounded by everything Lego. We went nuts. We submitted in Lego and won the competition, making a bigger model and finally built it in real size.”
In the basement-level vault of this museum is the mecca for lego fans, exhibiting some of the first of the greatest Lego sets ever made. They include Ingels’ first set, the yellow castle from 1979, “and the crowning achievement of my career, the Lego house made of Lego”, he says.
Ingels is emphatic that Lego is not a toy, but a “tool that empowers the user to create a world they have imagined and inhabit that world they’ve created through play and to invite others to inhabit it through play. That empowers the child to take control of his or her play, which is what architecture is all about: imagining and creating the world we want to live in”.
And speaking of empowerment of sorts, the power plant currently under construction in Copenhagen is likely to become a blueprint for the future of global eco waste management.
“If you negate the negative impact of infrastructure and make it a public utility, or in this case a power plant, it comes with premeditated positive social and environmental side effects,” Ingels says.
The plant will be the tallest and biggest building in Copenhagen. It is right next to the marina and a cable park where locals go water-skiing.
“We thought, how can this be a positive contribution to the neighbourhood not just an ugly box that blocks views and casts shadows on its neighbours,” says Ingels.
“In Denmark we have no mountains. But we have mountains of trash. At the same time, the nearest ski slope to us is a six-hour drive north to Sweden. So we proposed the entire roof of the plant would be an alpine ski park and also a hiking path for picnics and a public park for the citizens of Copenhagen. With the tallest climbing wall in the world at 100 metres. We miraculously won the competition based on this idea, so we had to deliver on it.
“There are no toxins coming out of this chimney. I love the idea that children born in Copenhagen this year won’t know of a world where you couldn’t ski on the roof of a power plant. Once you set that base level, those kids are going to be able to imagine really incredible things.”
Among other projects Ingels discusses are commercial and residential projects, or high-rise blocks, in Denmark, Amsterdam and New York, including award-winning VM Houses with JDS Architects.
These comprise two blocks of 80 different apartments in buildings shaped in a V and an M in Copenhagen, The Mountain, which is two-thirds a car park and one-third an apartment scheme in the Danish capital, and Via West 57 in Manhattan, an inverted version of BIG’s 8 House residential block in Denmark, which has the density of a skyscraper with the communal feel of a central courtyard and is, effectively, Ingels’ answer to a ‘courtscraper’.
Given all the projects he has worked on, including extraterrestrial ones, is there anything left that he has a burning desire to give form to?
“A living bridge,” he said. “Something like the Ponte Vecchio, but a modern version.” It’s a rather modest response from a man who thinks big, but, no doubt, it will be a living bridge that’s out of this world.

Wine from 1774 to be experienced through all five of the senses

It is very rare to find a wine in good condition which was made before the French Revolution. Vin Jaune, made in the Jura mountains of eastern France, is probably the only French wine capable of this longevity, according to Master of Wine Anthony Barne.
“To drink a glass of this is to experience history in the most immediate way possible and, if you count holding the bottle and pulling the cork, with all five senses,” Barne says. This week, three bottles from 1774 will go under the hammer in France, each expected to realise €15,000 to €20,000.
Made from the rare savagnin grape, Vin Jaune owes its longevity to a lengthy period of exposure to oxygen while in cask, protected from a premature demise by a film of the same yeast that occurs in Tokaji Szamorodni and Fino Sherry.
Last tasted in 1994 by 24 connoisseurs, scientists and oenologists, it was awarded a mark of 9.4/10.
Here’s how one summed it up: “Its appearance was superb, a deep colour of amber tinted old gold. The nose had a very intense rich fragrance of walnuts, ginger, cumin, fenugreek, cinnamon and vanilla, plus dried apricots, figs and raisins, beeswax and wood.
“It then developed roast coffee notes with caramel honey and gingerbread. The taste itself was structured and powerful, the marked acidity and alcohol matched by a touch of not-unpleasant bitterness and astringency.
“However, the flavours of nuts and spices were obvious, too, with some notes of oranges.”

Highlight: As the demand for flexible working spaces has soared, WeWork aims to meet the challenge head on, writes Leni Zneimer 
Body


As the workforce undergoes change, so does the way we work. In the early 2000s, the technological revolution brought wholesale changes to society and the way we connected and socialised with one another.
Offices began to change to reflect these new norms, and the open-plan workspaces and flatter hierarchies we recognise today began to be adopted by businesses everywhere.
At WeWork, we believe that almost 20 years later, the next evolution in the workplace is currently under way. If businesses are to stay ahead of the curve, they must adapt or face being left behind.
What is driving this need for change? According to recent estimations, millennials will comprise more than 50 per cent of the workforce by 2020 and 75 per cent by 2025. The world of work will then be dominated by a generation of employees with different expectations and demands of their employers.
Employers are already facing their own set of challenges in hiring and retaining the best talent. The workplace – and all it offers or should offer – is an integral part of that.
The transformation between these generations can largely be put down to further fundamental shifts that have occurred in how we communicate. The growing capabilities in technology are having a far-reaching impact on how people view and engage with each other.
This new ability to stay connected by being constantly online has also blurred the distinction between who we are and who we are at work. That clear divide that existed between when we are working and when we are not is, for most people now, entirely non-existent. Our work-self is now a part of who we are whether we’re in the office, at home or travelling.
This new flexible approach to working has created a change in employee mobility. It has led to an insurgence in workspaces where communication, interaction and community are in the highest demand. Employers are now not only under pressure to provide meaningful work but to prioritise it, increasingly at the expense of salary or financial compensation packages. As well as a work-life balance, this means a culture of rewards in the form of away days, bonuses and office design.
These factors are behind WeWork’s growing mission statement to create a world where people work to make a life, not just a living.
As the demand for flexible working spaces has soared, we’re now seeing interest not only from the thriving start-up culture but also from established corporates. WeWork’s members now include Citigroup, HSBC, Microsoft and KPMG alongside other household names like Spotify and Red Bull.
WeWork’s swift emergence in the market is built around meeting this demand head on and recognising that companies from all walks of life now recognise the advantage to providing attractive benefits.
This makes Dublin, with its key travel links, an obvious choice of expansion for WeWork. It is attractive for big businesses as well as innovative new ones. The city’s start-ups are harnessing ambitions to match the cohort of global tech companies that already reside in the city. Figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association showed that Irish tech firms raised a record €1 billion in 2017.
This emergence as an innovation hub means it was no surprise our locations in Dublin have already proven fantastically popular.
This has led to the recent addition of commercial office space in the Dublin Landings development located in the city’s docklands, that joins the Ulster Bank’s Dublin headquarters at 1 George’s Quay, now known as 1GQ, along with the location at Iveagh Court on Harcourt Road. As Dublin is such a connected international city, we can see our presence growing further in future too.
WeWork members will have access to all these locations in Dublin, so someone may work out of the Iveagh Court building but arrange a meeting in one of our docklands locations. Indeed, someone may work out of one our Dublin locations but work in one of our offices in New York or London if overseas on business. Through our app, our Dublin members will have a network of 250,000 WeWork members worldwide they can connect with too.
These new additions in Dublin bring the number of physical locations WeWork has accumulated to 71 cities and 21 countries around the world, but the company has also been looking to expand its portfolio into other areas. WeWork recently opened the Flatiron School’s international campus in London, a fast-growing coding school that offers both in-person and online courses, aiming to offer a new educational model fit for a tech-oriented world.
The project WeLive has seen the company also branch into housing by offering apartments designed around a “built in community”. The co-living start-up will hope to provide apartments with all the amenities you might expect – and a few that you might not – such as a yoga studio, an espresso bar and a happy hour; all features designed to get you out of your room and engaging with your neighbourhood.
At WeWork we believe that there has been a major shift towards a new way of working, living and learning – one focused on a movement towards meaning and personal fulfilment rather than just the bottom line. It is WeWork’s aim to accelerate this movement.

Highlight: Each week, we profile one of Ireland’s corporate leaders, tracing their career to date and exploring the lessons they have learned along the way. This week, we meet Lorraine Higgins, incoming chief executive of Retail Excellence 
Body


Lorraine Higgins will take over as chief executive of Retail Excellence, the representative body for the Irish retail sector, in July.
A barrister and former senator, Higgins joined Retail Excellence in January 2017 as head of public affairs and was appointed chief executive designate last September. She joined the Board of Directors of Ecommerce Europe earlier this year. The Brussels-headquartered organisation represents more than 75,000 companies selling goods and services online to consumers in Europe.
Tell us about your career to date.
I studied politics and history at NUI Galway, or UCG as we called it in those days. I then went on to the Honorable Society of Kings Inns where I studied law and completed my Barrister at Law Degree. I joined the Law Library in 2005 and started lecturing in the same year. I worked as a barrister until soon after I was appointed to the Senate in 2011.
Focused on developing a political career, I jettisoned my legal one which was something I questioned the wisdom of in 2016. However, the profession provided a working home and purpose for me, before I joined Retail Excellence.
Established 22 years ago in Dublin by David Fitzsimons, it is now the largest retail representative body in Ireland with close to 2,000 members operating more than 13,000 stores.
Last week, we hosted the Global Retail Council’s mid-year meeting at our annual retreat and expo in Dublin. Representatives from retail bodies in 30 countries attended the event at Citywest Convention Centre.
Are you where you expected to be in your career?
At 25, I was sure I would be donning a wig and gown every day for the rest of my life. I had spent seven years in college striving to become a lawyer. I also thought I had a future career in politics. Given my very poor forecasting skills, I’ve given up dreaming about what the future holds.
What was the best career advice you got along the way?
Post-election in 2016, I spent a few months trying to decipher what next. I had a few opportunities at home and abroad, but nothing was setting me on fire and I was growing increasingly frustrated. I was used to being busy and there were only so much golf I could play. However, over 18 holes discussing what do next with a good friend and mentor, he advised me to move to Dublin, do something new and make it great. He told me to forget about what I used to do, but take what I had learned with me. Those words gave me impetus and focus and, ultimately, brought about a major turning point in my career and life.
Based on your own experience, what are your top career tips?
Make your own path. In the end, only you can decide. I have always listened to advice offered to me, but I have ultimately made the decision myself.
Never look back with regret. Move on to what is waiting for you and think of your former working life as your foundation.
Work harder than everyone else around you. It worked for me and my little bit of talent.
Be patient. There’s always ‘Day 8’.
Be decent. It’s nice to be important, but it’s more important to be nice. I think, in the end, it’s not about what you’ve achieved, but how you’ve helped others that matters.
How would you define your work style, and how has this evolved over the years?
I have only one gear and that is sixth gear. While I might have run around in circles working hard during my younger years I have since honed this energy and developed a strategic focus which ultimately produces better results.
In terms of managing teams and individuals, what are your insights?
I always think of the analogy of a car and how it runs smoothly if all of the tyres are pumped. A team is no different. But a leader must bring their team with them, motivate them and work with them to overcome boundaries.
I hate the word ‘can’t’. My style is about enabling. I like to see people reach their peak and when I have contributed, I get just as much satisfaction.
Get their input and respect their views. If you disagree, try to find common ground to move forward. Communicate effectively and avoid grey areas. Always try to instil and foster an environment of respect.
Has networking played an important part in your career?
Networking has played a part in everything I have done since leaving law, even though I don’t think it was something I did consciously.
I have learned that it’s important to always be respectful of someone’s time, show appreciation for it and develop emotional intelligence. Never invade someone’s personal space.
If you had to choose another career tomorrow, what would it be and why?
I am grateful for the career I have, but if I had to switch career tomorrow, I would definitely stick with business. It makes me tick and I feel energised by it.
I also have an entrepreneurial streak and enjoy spotting new opportunities. Maybe someday I will put flesh on a few of them.

SYNTH-POP
Chvrches: Love Is Dead (Virgin/Glassnote)
Scottish synth-pop act Chvrches have taken a measured approach to their music and the associated commercial results that can come with it. From 2013’s debut album The Bones Of What You Believe, via 2015’s follow-up Every Open Eye, the trio (Lauren Mayberry, Iain Cook, Martin Doherty) have upped their game without overstepping the mark. Love Is Dead, however, is the clincher: with the exception of II (a one-minute insert towards the end of the album that aims for avant-atmosphere but falls short), there isn’t one song here that won’t be blasted out of either a radio or a car stereo during the summer months. Its commercial prospects are certainly aided by the presence of US producer/songwriter Greg Kurstin (Adele, Sia, Lily Allen), whose signature sonic fairy-dust is sprinkled on top of nine of the album’s 13 tracks. But this doesn’t take anything away from the openly assertive pop music that Chvrches have had as their trademark from the very start. As for those instantly memorable songs, the likes of Graffiti, Get Out, Deliverance, Graves, and My Enemy (a co-vocal with The National’s Matt Berninger) are near-certain stepping stones to much wider mainstream success.

Arctic Monkeys: Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (Domino)
“I just wanted to be one of The Strokes/Now look at the mess you made me make.” So speak-sings Alex Turner through a shimmering showbiz reverb on jazzy opening track Star Treatment. This is Arctic Monkeys but not as we know them – restyled as a lounge band in a casino on the moon. On first listen, their sixth album sounds almost as lunatic as the concept: their signature riffs and hooks replaced by deft piano chords, laid-back basslines and cheesy-listening production values. Yet it’s a genuine grower. Turner remains a clever, anecdotal lyricist, crooning and drawling, rather than volleying a plethora of smart-arsed one-liners over chilled-out grooves; and there’s still some swagger, albeit unflustered, in the fuzzy guitar lead of Golden Trunks, the dogged glam of Four Out Of Five and the clipped hip-hop beat of One Point Perspective. Rather than being a properly experimental undertaking, Tranquility Base is a smart, exploratory pastiche, exaggerating the essence of an era when David Bowie, the Beach Boys and Serge Gainsbourg were true innovators, to showcase sophisticated new dimensions to Turner’s songwriting. Daft, audacious and beautifully done.

Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks: Sparkle Hard (Domino)
For many fans of loosely constructed, guitar-driven alt-pop songs, Stephen Malkmus is the magnet that attracted them to the genre in the first place. As the vocalist and songwriter in 1990s Californian cult band Pavement, Malkmus divided opinion – he was deemed a genius (by prominent US music critic Robert Christgau) and a musician who didn’t “have an original idea in his head” (by The Fall’s Mark E Smith). Clearly, he was doing something that hit a nerve all those years ago, and judging by Sparkle Hard, the seventh work from the songwriter and his post-Pavement band The Jicks, he still is. The songcraft here, however, is much more direct than on previous albums, which have careered from one style to another without much apparent thought. Everything here is tight, coherent and to the point, perhaps Malkmus’s way of cutting through what he has described as “the noise” of contemporary pop music. With most of the 11 songs in or around the three-minute mark, he could be accused of veering towards a pop music framework, but his underlying contrarian characteristics confirm he’s at the opposite end to obvious. Mark E Smith was wrong.

Highlight: Cinema’s sacred code of conduct is being flouted by too many phone-wielding, popcorn-munching buffoons. It’s time someone finally shouted:  ‘Shush!’ 
Body


A couple of weeks ago, a Twitter thread went viral, as they do. The tweeter had visited the cinema to see the latest Amy Schumer comedy I Feel Pretty, in which Amy feels pretty, even though she’s a complete minger. Or something. I haven’t seen the film. And Amy Schumer is certainly not a complete minger. But, you know, Hollywood.
Anyway, the tweeter rose to prominence because she realised Oscar-nominated actor and director Greta Gerwig had joined the screening and was sitting right in front of her. However, instead of saving up this titbit of information to tell her friends later, or maybe to send out in a solitary tweet, she proceeded to document live how Gerwig and her friends reacted to the film.
They didn’t react wholly favourably, according to the tweets, and that in itself caused a ripple of discontent with the film’s creators, and also opened a further discussion about privacy and what a person can reasonably be expected to do in their day-to-day lives without being live-tweeted by the mole behind them.
All of these issues pale in comparison, however, when you consider the true crime committed: This tweeter had their phone out, and their big glaring light illuminating their big stupid face, for the entire film. This, my friends, is cinema treason. I don’t care if Steven Spielberg himself has wandered into your nostalgia screening of ET and is occasionally pointing out his favourite bits to his companion. Your phone stays in your pocket.
Unless you are a heart surgeon waiting for a call to carry out an emergency operation on a very sick child, and you are the only heart surgeon in the country capable of carrying out such a procedure, your phone stays in your pocket. In that case, you might also want to check out the medical code of ethics or what have you, rather than tucking into a large popcorn and a wheelie-bin of Coke.
In an attempt to defend themselves, the Greta Gerwig tweeter said there was nobody sitting behind them in the cinema, hence the light couldn’t have been irritating anyone. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOUR! Regardless of your seating situation, regardless of your proximity to anyone else in the theatre, regardless of anything, it is reprehensible to be on your phone. I shall not be moved on this.
Cinema pests are my ultimate nemeses. Those people who wait until a nice, quiet moment to open their sharing bag of Fruit Pastilles? I want them dead. Those couples who take turns resting their heads on each other’s shoulders, shuffling around like a dog with fleas? First against the wall in my bloody revolution. Loud whisperers? Worse than the out-and-out talkers in my opinion. The list of offences goes on and on.
If you are a fan of BBC Radio 5 Live’s flagship film show Wittertainment with Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo (which I highly recommend) you will know that they are evangelical about their code of conduct, which prohibits phones, talking and food of any type, apart from a soft roll with no filling eaten silently and quickly. Now, this is a little extreme, but after a visit to the Odeon at the Point Village last year to see Ghostbusters, during which a woman in the audience took pictures of her child using a flash, I have become more hardline.
During a more recent trip to the cinema, a man several rows in front of me checked his phone at least every ten minutes, just casually checking his WhatsApp, his Instagram and what have you. I can’t remember the film I saw, but the back of this oaf’s head is permanently seared into my retinas.
Of course, Greta Gerwig is not without blame here either. She was speaking loudly enough in the cinema that the tweeter could hear her and thus relay her musings about I Feel Pretty to the world – for the record, she reportedly thought some bits were funny, but also loudly pointed out a plot hole and stated that the film was “in-comp-re-hensible”. Had I been there, I would have been compelled to shush her, Oscar nomination or no. I didn’t talk loudly when I went to see Ladybird, Greta. I enjoyed Mistress America in silence. Maybe you could show the makers of I Feel Pretty the same courtesy.

Baroque puts wind in sails of NCH’s showpiece

The annual launch of the National Concert Hall’s new international series always brings on the urge for deep analysis and speculation about the choice of orchestras and artists. It’s a bit like reading the tea leaves as to how trends are developing in one way or another.
In reality, it’s much simpler than that. Great orchestras are on tour all the time, as are great chamber ensembles and great choirs: it’s a case of fitting the jigsaw together as to who are available at what time and, indeed, at what cost!
Getting the balance right, both in concerts and costs, is the real trick. And the NCH team deserves great credit for continually assembling superbly attractive blends of concerts right across the classical genres.
If there is a discernible trend, it is the fact that music from the baroque and renaissance periods has made significant inroads in the past couple of years, with the inclusion of great British choral outfits such The Sixteen and The Tallis Scholars attracting full houses and garnering rave reviews. This continues for the 2018/2019 season with The Cardinall’s Musick – described as the jewel in the crown of early music consorts – and the return of the Grammy award-winning Chanticleer from San Francisco, deemed “the world’s reigning male chorus” by the New Yorker.
“This is our flagship music series,” said NCH chief Simon Taylor, “and it is not just a case of putting an attractive programme together, but of one where every name in it sparkles, and I believe we have really accomplished that for the coming season. The schedule is a veritable treasure trove of choral, chamber, recital and orchestral music by the world’s leading musicians. When I mention great names like Pinchas Zukerman, András Schiff, Gidon Kremer and Paul Lewis, you will know what I mean.’’
On the orchestral front – always the cause of great expectation – the big arrivals are the Baltimore Symphony, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the Royal Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra.
[caption id="attachment_416618" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Nicola Benedetti Pic: Claudio Lehrmann[/caption]
The Baltimore is under musical director Marin Alsop with an all-Bernstein programme featuring dances from West Side Story and the dazzling violinist Nicola Benedetti, a perennial favourite in this neck of the woods.
Alsop, one of the world’s leading conductors, is a protégée of Bernstein. This concert on August 29 will be straight after the orchestra’s performance at the BBC Proms.
The LSO, now under the artistic direction of Simon Rattle, will play the second of five concerts at the NCH up to 2021, though it is not clear yet which will be conducted by Rattle himself.
On the chamber front, there is a welcome return of the nine-time Grammy award winner Emerson String Quartet, while the celebrated Latvian violinist Gidon Kermer and his Kremerata Baltica make their NCH debut as cultural ambassadors for the three Baltic states celebrating the centenary of their initial independence this year (October 18, 2018).
Another feature of the international series introduced in recent times is the inclusion of leading Irish artists and the teaming of pianist John O’Conor and mezzosoprano Tara Erraught in a special recital of Strauss, Mahler and Rossini is sure to be an early sell-out, though it is almost a year away.

REVIEW
Birr Festival of Music & Voice
Birr Theatre & Arts Centre, Birr
Reviewed by Dick O’Riordan
By the time we arrived in the charming Georgian town for the four-day Birr Festival of Music & Voice, two of its main concerts were already gone – but certainly not forgotten.
Music lovers had been wowed by “a stunning river of arias” from Cara O’Sullivan – a local’s description, not mine – while a concert of Chopin and Brahms by pianist Finghin Collins and clarinetist John Finucane had ignited music imaginations with “a real darling of a night”. And who am I to say otherwise?
Luckily, I did manage to catch a rapturous afternoon recital in Birr Castle by rising mezzo-soprano Carolyn Holt, a full-voiced young singer brimming with confidence and attitude.
My main business, however, was the festival’s highlight, the fifth awarding of the annual Trench Award for aspiring professional singers and musicians from the general area of the midlands.
The overall prize fund is €5,000 and was very hotly contested, the winner being tenor Philip Keegan from Tullamore, who pocketed not only €3,500 to help further his career, but also a week-long residency at an Italian voice academy. The beaming young tenor, who also plays viola and piano, was the RIAM’s outstanding student for 2016/17.
Another RIAM winner was oboist Ben Gannon from Longford, who collected the Birr Lions Club bursary of €1,500, while pianist JJ Mc Namara won the audience prize with a piece of ivory-blistering Liszt.
Festival director Maureen de Forge paid tribute to the Trench Award organisers, saying it was an invaluable asset in helping young musicians of the region pursue their dream of professional careers.
The judges were conductor David Brophy, singer Cara O’Sullivan and festival committee Enda O’Connor.

Fabiano Caruana vs Arkadij Naiditsch
GRENKE Chess Classic 2018
The 2018 World Championship finalist Fabiano Caruana continued an excellent run of form by winning the Grenke Chess Classic ahead of Magnus Carlsen.

Taking with the queen would have maintained an extra pawn, but left Black with some initiative. Instead, Caruana takes a practical decision of playing for a position which is deceptively dangerous for Black.

Black should hold this symmetrical and simplified position, but needs to be careful because of his more exposed king.
27.Nf5 Kh7 28.g3 Ne5 29.Qe3 Nc4 30.Qc3 Qe5 31.Qd3! Nxb2 32.Qc2 Qe1+ 33.Kg2 Qd1 34.Qe4 Qxa4?
Although it is far from obvious, this move is the decisive mistake. 34 . . . Qd7 would have retained the balance.
35.Qxb7 Qa2 (D)
36.Ne3!!
The only winning move, and a highly counterintuitive one, moving the knight away from the black king. The black knight can’t come into play since . . . Nd3 is met by Qe4+.
36 . . . Kg7 37.Qb4!
Again preventing . . . Nd3.
37 . . . Qb1 38.g4 Kg8 39.Nf5 Qc2 40.Qb8+ Kh7 41.Qb7 Kh8 42.Qe7! 1-0
The most accurate, continuing to prevent . . . Qe4+. Black can only avoid mate at the cost of his knight, for example 42.Qe7 Qc6+ 43.Kh2 Qg6 44.Qe5+ followed by taking on b2.

Deadpool 2: Directed by David Leitch, Nationwide, 16 Rating: **
Filmworker: Directed by Tony Zierra, Selected, 15A, Rating: ****
Raunchy and super- violent, the first Deadpool was a massive success when it was released in 2016. It was classified 16 (a rarity for a comic-book adventure), it was released in February (a rarity for a superhero blockbuster), and it went on to earn more than €700 million at the worldwide box office, a rarity for Ryan Reynolds.
It was a foul-mouthed satire of Marvel’s biggest cash cows that became one of the studio’s biggest cash cows itself. Deadpool is a wisecracking mercenary with a terminal cancer diagnosis whose life is saved, and changed forever, when he undergoes an experimental treatment that gives him super powers, including but not limited to the ability to automatically self-heal. With an indestructible body and a freewheeling mind, Reynolds’s character is refreshingly insolent and disarmingly earnest, inventive and formulaic, full of bravado and hamstrung by his slavish devotion to pop-culture references. The sequel gives us more of the same.
The plot of Deadpool 2 is the usual small-scale, everyday affair: Having suffered an unexpected loss, a rootless Deadpool joins forces with mutants Bedlam (Terry Crews), Zeitgeist (Bill Skarsgård) and Domino (Zazie Beetz) to protect a chubby, fire-starting teenage mutant (Julian Dennison from Hunt for the Wilderpeople) from the all-powerful, time-travelling super-soldier Cable (Josh Brolin), equipped with a robotic arm. No stranger to making enemies, Deadpool must now make friends with the group he calls X-Force, the first in a long parade fourth-wall piercing winks at the domination of interchangeable superhero films in contemporary cinema. That’s the joke, and if you don’t get it, too bad.
David Leitch’s film, scripted by returning writing team Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese with a further credit for Reynolds, is a gruesome romp that rejoices both in the carefree spilling of buckets of blood and in a sneering self-consciousness about the genre from which it springs.
It’s overlong, unintelligible and almost unbearably smug, but what saves it from outright cynicism is Reynolds’s lively, multi-faceted performance which carries throughout the sense that he believes in the character and is fully invested in the subversive, corporation-baiting formula he has devised. And that’s great, necessary even, but whether you share that point of view or not will have considerable bearing on what value the film holds for you.
[caption id="attachment_416603" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Leon Vitali in Filmworker[/caption]
The same week that Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey gets a 50th anniversary 70mm screening at the Cannes film festival, Filmworker, a penetrating documentary portrait of his long-time personal assistant Leon Vitali, arrives in cinemas.
Kubrick aficionados will already know Vitali as the young actor with the Jagger pout who played the callow Lord Bullingdon in his masterpiece Barry Lyndon. After filming was completed in 1976, he retired as an actor to become Kubrick’s right-hand man, a role he would play for 23 years - the rest of Kubrick’s life - and for nearly another two decades after his death. It was Vitali who did the colour-timing on the 70mm print for Cannes.
We tend to think of film directors as driven generals leading an army of crack troops on a dangerous mission. It’s a useful cliché, but only partly accurate. The essence of what it means to be a film director — especially if you’re as serious and powerful an artist as Kubrick — is that you occupy a dozen roles at once. You’re a negotiator and a politician, an image-maker and a storyteller, a coach and a therapist and, when required, a general. Vitali was the lieutenant.
Staggered across memories of the four films he worked on - Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut - Vitali gives us a unique insight into what was going on behind the scenes, the creative highs and mercurial lows. He worked non-stop on multiple aspects of every subsequent production, on jobs big and small; from casting (5,000 auditions to find a Danny Torrance), to editing (Kubrick was particular about colour), dialogue coach to promotions and logistics, occasional actor and the keeper of fastidious records. Kubrick was obsessively driven and expected everyone around him to be the same. For Vitali, it was more a vocation than a job.
Scattered among Vitali’s treasure-trove of photographs, footage and mounds of documents, Zierra conducts short conversations with some of the actors Vitali coached, including Danny Lloyd (who rarely submits to interviews) and the late R Lee Ermey, who credits Vitali with casting him as the unforgettable drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket.
An unmissable treat for Kubrick fans (who study his life and work like few others), for the general audience Vitali emerges as a compulsive figure with a unique relationship with a great artist. Kubrick prided himself on being a reclusive enigma; Vitali brings us all a step closer to getting to know him.
Jeune Femme (IFI)
Léonor Serraille’s comedy – a winner at last year’s Cannes film festival – is essentially the French Bridget Jones, detailing the trials and embarrassments of a thirtysomething woman (Laetitia Dosch), financially and romantically strapped, struggling to get by in the bustling Parisian metropolis.
Citizen Lane (selected, G)
Thaddeus O’Sullivan directs Tom Vaughan-Lawlor in this innovative docudrama (written by Mark O’Halloran) about the short life and turbulent times of art gallerist and philanthropist Hugh Lane, one of the key figures of the Irish cultural renaissance in the early 20th century. With Derbhle Crotty as his aunt, Lady Gregory, and Marty Rea as artist William Orpen, alongside interviews with contemporary contributors.
Revenge (selected, 18)
Coralie Fargeat’s blood-soaked debut tells, as the title insists, a story of vengeance enacted by an abused woman against her abusers. Sumptuously staged and brimful of violence, it cleverly warps exploitation clichés into an empowering feminist thriller.
The Young Karl Marx (IFI, no cert)
Released to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Marx’s birth, Cuban director Raoul Peck’s fun biopic details the intellectual bromance between charismatic social philosopher Marx (August Diehl) and dandy economist Friedrich Engels as they put together the Communist Manifesto in London.
Avengers: Infinity War (nationwide, 12A)
The biggest film in the world right now gathers every Marvel superhero together for a gargantuan battle with space-Hitler Thanos (Josh Brolin), whose promise of apocalyptic devastation doesn’t seem so bad when you consider how many more Avengers films Disney have coming down the tracks.

Bonsai Bar
17 South Great George’s Street, Dublin 2
01-5267701, thebonsaibar.com
Chef: Dylan McGrath
I saw a Sex on the Beach on a cocktail menu recently. No, really – that sickly-sweet concoction that we all ordered in nightclubs (or ‘niteclubs’, to give them their proper historical spelling) when we were 17 is apparently still a thing in some parts of the country.
Now don’t get me wrong, I’m no drink snob. But I’m equally not all that keen on cocktail lists that look like throwbacks to the days when our choices were between black Russians, Long Island iced teas and cosmopolitans (I ordered one of the latter recently, and believe me, they have not aged well since their 1990s heyday).
Boring cocktail options are not, thankfully, an issue in the Bonsai Bar. It’s located on the middle floor of the building on South Great George’s Street in Dublin city centre that houses the Rustic Stone on the ground floor, and Taste at Rustic on the top floor.
All three are the domain of Dylan McGrath, a chef whose personality may have riled as many people as it has thrilled over the years, but whose ability to produce innovative, thoughtful and flavourful food is matched by few, if any, of his peers on this island.
Now aged 40 and, along with his business partner, the employer of more than 300 people between this building and the Fade Street Social one around the corner, McGrath has of late immersed himself in Japanese cooking techniques and flavours.
Bonsai Bar opened last winter with a menu of cocktails and bar bites, and on a warm early-summer evening in Dublin – too warm for a large dinner - that sounded just the ticket.
[caption id="attachment_416667" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] The Dylan McGrath venue shows the chef continuing to surprise and delight[/caption]
McGrath being McGrath, these are no ordinary drinks and nibbles. Instead of fish goujons and warm white wine, you can expect to eat black cod and aubergine cooked in breadcrumbs (€4.50) and served with tare, a sweetened soy sauce, and drink a Urashima, a cocktail made with shiitake mushroom-infused Absolut vodka, tomato juice, dashi and sriracha (€11).
As it happened, the cod was off on the night we visited, so we ordered one each of the seven remaining bar bites, then concentrated on the cocktails. There are a dozen of them, and they are unlike anything you will see on a menu anywhere else in Ireland, so a little studying will be required.
I kept it light with my first one, the Sakura Blossom (€14), a pretty-as-a-picture mix of Beefeater gin, maraschino and pink grapefruit liqueurs and pink grapefruit juice finished with sparkling rosé sake and edible (or drinkable, in this case) flower petals. My guest’s Yokai – Monkey 47 gin with white crème de cacao and maraschino liqueur (€14) - was a stronger affair, but perfectly balanced.
As we sipped them, our food began to arrive. Octopus, not something I’m usually wild about, was crispy and delicious, and served with thin discs of radish that had been pickled in ginger, sesame and wasabi (€5.50).
Crunchy shiitake mushrooms with spiced nori crackers (€4.50) were moreish (so moreish that my companion ordered seconds), and I did the same with the salmon sashimi (€6), which was topped with a little avocado purée and bonito.
I’d have said it was probably the best sashimi I’d ever had in Dublin if it weren’t for the fact that it was immediately bettered by some yellowfin tuna served on a kimchi croquette and topped with a cured egg yolk (€8).
Our final fish dish was flaked crabmeat that had been simply dressed with ponzu and herbs, then served in a teriyaki cracker with salmon roe (€5).
Beef came in the form of little wagyu burgers, with the meat torched then glazed with sweet miso, and tiny shallot rings added for texture (€9), while a veggie dish of nashi pear soaked in ponzu and honey, and topped with avocado purée, umeboshi, radish and sesame, was a sublime mix of bitter and sweet.
There are no desserts on offer in the bar, so instead we had two of the more indulgent cocktails on the menu. The first, the Ryu (€12), delivered quite a kick, with chilli bitters teamed with Absolut citron, ginger liqueur, crème de cassis, gingerbread syrup and egg white. Again though the balance was perfect, with the spicing not drowning out the other flavours.
Served in a traditional Japanese teapot, the Bunbuku (€14) was a dessert in cocktail form, with Absolut raspberry, white chocolate liqueur, coconut molasses and coconut purée cut by a little lime.
It had been a fascinating, and long overdue, return to a Dylan McGrath venue.
We’d wanted a mid-week bite that was tasty but not formal, and ended up immersed in the boundary-pushing, smile-inducing world of a chef who shows no signs of losing his ability to surprise and delight. And to that, I say an enthusiastic kanpai.
Four cocktails and nine bar bites came to €107.
Starter: black cod and crushed aubergine with tare sauce, €4.50, and dashi pear with ponzu, honey and avocado purée, €4.50
Main course: crab claws with ponzu and herbs, €5, and salmon sashimi, €6
Drinks: Momotaro, Absolut pear with pear purée, fresh lemon, homemade wasabi syrup, soda water, peach bitters and grapefruit oils, €11
Dinner for two: €62
Starter: fried octopus with radish, €5.50, and crunchy shiitake mushrooms, €4.50
Main course: mini wagyu burgers, €9, and akame tuna, €8
Drinks: Tengu Old Fashioned, Japanese whiskey with muscovado sugar, angostura bitters and pink grapefruit zest oils (€14)
Dinner for two: €82
The drinks list at Bonsai Bar is an ode to the culture, taste and aesthetic vision of Japan, and so beautifully realised that it is one of the best drinks lists in this country. The list evokes Japanese culture through 12 engagingly described cocktails, each designed by Carl Cooney to express an iconic cultural moment.
The Three Beauties cocktail evokes an 18th-century Japanese woodcut called Three Beauties of the Present Day, a triumph of muted colours and balanced forms. This cocktail is a lattice of 12-year-old Glenfiddich Whisky, Kummell, Oleo-Saccharum, fresh lime, lychee purée and egg white at €14.
Each cocktail, priced from €11 to €14, celebrates similar Japanese cultural markers, from mystic monsters and folk tales to 16th-century samurai heroes. There are also 14 iterations of sake, a wall of gin, a handful of wines and more than 50 whiskeys, including Japanese whisky icon Nikka Distillery’s Nikka from the Barrel, which is sold by the glass measure at €11.50.
Our pick of the cocktails is the ghostly Yokai at €14, blending Monkey 47 Gin, white Crème de Cacao and Maraschino liqueur.

Patrick Melrose, Sky Atlantic
Daniel and Majella’s B&B Road Trip, RTÉ One
Claire Byrne Live, RTÉ One
Is it the singer or the song, the dancer or the dance? I’m talking about performances in television dramas that steal the show, dazzling turns that may elevate the quality of a drama from excellent to exceptional.
Think of Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell in BBC Two’s Wolf Hall, a simmering, measured character reading, masterfully delivered with subtlety and nuance. Now we have another masterly performance employing an entirely different range of acting brilliance from Benedict Cumberbatch as Patrick Melrose (Sky Atlantic).
Melrose is a deeply wounded and febrile creature, a victim of his own class, those his creator Edward St Aubyn, calls “monsters of English privilege”.
The five autobiographical novels that encompass the growing to maturity of the fictional Melrose expose, in a balance between private pain and social comedy, the fatuity, vacuity and amorality of English landed gentry living on inherited wealth. Here individuals pride themselves on being spoken of as someone who, perhaps, might have been a great prime minister. “Might have been”, in this world, somehow carries a greater social cachet than having been.
Out of such a society (as much as any other) must come dark secrets, and the secret hinted at in the first episode of Patrick Melrose is Patrick’s sexual abuse by his father, David (Hugo Weaving). St Aubyn, who was addicted to drugs for 12 years from age 16, says he was raped by his father between the ages of five and eight.
Viewers who watched the first episode, which is based on his second novel Bad News, could hardly have misread the implications in the menacing figure of Patrick’s father, in flashbacks, summoning the child to his room. The first novel Never Mind, which forms the basis of the second episode, revealed these grotesque events.
Bad News opens in 1982, with David Melrose dead in New York and temporarily residing in that city’s best funeral home. As one of his fruity-voiced chums breaks the bad news to Patrick (first seen as a figure hunched and scrabbling for a syringe on the floor), it becomes clear from Cumberbatch’s face that this is not at all bad news, as far as he’s concerned. As the heroin kicks in, so too does the relieving realisation that his childhood tormentor is at last doornail-dead.
Collecting the corpse, or rather the ashes, involves a two-day trip to New York for a one-sided conversation with his soon to be incinerated father, nicely gift-wrapped in a coffin. “Is it Dad? It is! It’s just what I wanted. You shouldn’t have!” It also involves an orgy of heroin, cocaine, Quaaludes, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and alcohol. He slithers down walls, wallows half-dressed in the bath and trashes his five-star hotel room, unconcernedly paying for the damage with a flurry of dollars. Then, equally unconcernedly, he strolls into the armpit of New York to hunt for drugs.
Patrick has a string of adoring and concerned girlfriends for whom he promises to give up drugs, and a juvenile self (Sebastian Maltz) who creeps into his consciousness to remind him of innocence defiled and why he is the way he is.
It’s a whopping performance by Cumberbatch, balancing intense physicality with superb vocal control, the mind in turmoil quoting Beckett and a string of others who observe life’s bleak comedy. The package creates an entirely credible and endearing character of a narcissistic, schizoid, suicidal alcoholic who somehow manages to be aware of and comment on his condition and feels he can pull back from the brink at any time.
“I have spent 22 years trying to transform painful lived experience into what I hope is a pleasurable reading experience. The intention was to make a work of art, rather than a confession,” St Aubyn said in a Guardian interview around the time of the publication of the final Melrose novel, At Last. “The core Melrose characters, the parents and Patrick, are portraits of me and my parents, but everything else is less direct, and there’s always compression.”
There has been further compression to get the five novels into five episodes, and, on the evidence of the one episode broadcast so far, an excellent job has been done. The series is directed by Edward Berger, who directed something completely different in the 2015 Stasi thriller series Deutschland ’83. Definitely one to watch.
From the near sublime to the faintly silly. Daniel and Majella’s B&B Road Trip (RTÉ One) has returned for a third series, since its transfer from a rival station. It follows the predicable pattern established early on.
The pair arrive at B&B establishments to be royally greeted by admirers and, in one case last week, a bare-kneed, kilted piper playing in blowing sleet. They appraise and praise the room and en suite. They endure entertainments – some less dignified than others – arranged by their hosts. There’s a little bit of friskiness between Daniel and Majella (Daniel gets his bottom patted or squeezed from time to time) and they have breakfast. They also bicker a little as they drive around the country. Just like any couple; sure isn’t it only great?
Every B&B owner so far has been ecstatic at the prospect of having them under their roof, which leaves me to wonder if these proprietors are quizzed in advance as to their adherence to the cult of the Kincasslagh crooner. In one Kerry B&B after a spinning class last week, a sweating Daniel was presented with a towel with his image on it. It was just a little too close to the sudarium, the cloth with which Veronica wiped Christ’s face on the way to Calvary, and which ever after bore the image of that face. The battered visage of Christ impressed miraculously on a cloth was a very popular devotional image in Catholic homes. An outsize one hanging on my bedroom wall when I was a child gave me recurring nocturnal heebie-jeebies.
And from the faintly silly to the chaotic. The Claire Byrne Live (RTÉ One) debate on the abortion referendum should give RTÉ cause to reassess its staging of what rapidly became a bear pit, especially as a Prime Time debate on the emotionally loaded subject is planned for this Tuesday night. Managing a large, participating partisan audience may be beyond a single presenter, whoever that might be.
Byrne’s performance on the night lent support to this viewpoint but, given the long-standing tendency of both sides in the abortion debate to resort to sloganeering and disparagement, things could have been even worse.
She endured outbreaks of groaning, derisive laughter, applause, whoops, accusations of lying, assertions that were never questioned or developed, cheap shots, flashes of professional arrogance, squabbles between eminent obstetricians on rival panels about the state of development of a foetus at 12 weeks (one suggesting the other might return to school), GPs divided, lawyers divided, women in the audience describing traumas of birth and death, the Savita Halappanavar question, the proposed legislation, and the Yes panel armed with the only political big gun in the studio: Mary Lou McDonald, a dogged debater who knows how to broaden the appeal of her argument with the use of subordinate clauses.
Any debate must, at this stage, attempt to sway the undecided voter, and it seemed to me that as the RTÉ debate reached its final stages, the proponents of the No vote landed some heavy emotional punches. I’d be prepared to bet, however, that a lot of uneasy and queasy undecideds may not vote at all. Let’s see.

Highlight: For Limerick band Whenyoung, a spontaneous reaching out to Shane MacGowan’s manager set in motion  a chain of events that led to their upcoming appearance on the Nick Cave/Patti Smith double bill in Kilmainham next month, writes Nadine O’Regan 
Body


Sometimes, if you want to get somewhere in life, you have to take a risk. Last November, after the Irish band Whenyoung recorded a version of Fairytale of New York, the classic song from the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl, they didn’t just sit on their hands.
“We sent it to Gerry O’Boyle, who is Shane MacGowan’s manager,” Aoife Power, the band’s frontperson, relates down the phone line from her adopted home of London. “Shortly after, I got an invitation to perform at Shane’s 60th. It was completely overwhelming and exciting.”
That was the strange and surprising route that led to the situation whereby Power – lead singer of a hitherto relatively unknown Limerick band – got to step on stage at the National Concert Hall in January, alongside talent including Nick Cave, Sinéad O’Connor, Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream, Cerys Matthews, Glen Hansard and MacGowan himself, on the occasion of MacGowan’s 60th birthday. “I was very nervous,” Power recalls. “But everyone was very supportive.”
Clad in red, like a fire engine against a sea of indie black, Power’s commanding vocals proved a stand-out in a night glittering with stars. If people hadn’t known about Whenyoung before, they certainly started making enquiries after that evening. Then came their popular YouTube video in which Power sang a haunting rendition of the Cranberries’ Dreams, her vocals seeming to float across the music in a manner strikingly reminiscent of Dolores O’Riordan herself.
Now Whenyoung have signed a deal with Virgin EMI, which will see them release their debut album with the label next year, and a new single at the end of this month. The trio will also support Nick Cave and Patti Smith at their June gig in Kilmainham in Dublin this summer. It’s official: Whenyoung are a band on the verge.
When I catch up with Power, she’s groggy from the evening before, in which they played in Hull as support to the band Peace. Already, the venues they’re tackling are getting larger. “Most of the venues, you play to 500 people and some of them are sold out,” she says happily. “Having a crowd sing back your songs is amazing.”
The daughter of artistic types (her father is a meditation teacher and her mother is a ceramist and painter), Power, 28, feels she’s coming to music late. But better late than not at all. “I kind of gave up hope until I met the guys,” she says, speaking of her bandmates, guitarist Niall Burns and drummer Andrew Flood. “As a kid, I was in bands with my friends and would be writing songs. But I just stopped dreaming and thought that I had to go to university and stuff.”
Power studied landscape architecture in UCD, before moving to London and becoming a freelance gardener. Entirely by chance, she wound up taking care of gardening duties for Mairead Hayden, the former manager of Florence and the Machine, who quickly spotted her talent. “She owns this coffee shop and record shop, and she asked us to play there, then she asked to manage us,” Power says.
Now – under Hayden’s stewardship – Whenyoung are being feted as upcoming stars, and their recent single Pretty Pure, a catchy indie-pop confection, has confirmed that they have nascent songwriting chops that could match their performance abilities. It hasn’t gone unnoticed, either, that the band are making guitar music in a landscape dominated by synthesisers and syncopated pop beats. “We’ve been lucky in that we haven’t been asked to change what we sound like,” says Power. “I guess it’s more popular to do synth music, but guitar music is what we do.”
Unsurprisingly, Power’s idols come from an older era of music. “I love the looseness of Janis Joplin or Patti Smith,” she says. “And Debbie Harry. We love Blondie.”
Like that band, Whenyoung have a strong visual presence. Power tends to not bother with make-up or stylised hair. Instead, she and her bandmates dress in strong colours – reds and blues – and favour boiler suits for their live performances. “Andy found a blue boiler suit in a charity shop and he thought it would be a good look,” Power says. “We thought it would be good for stage and it’s become kind of a thing now.”
Power is looking forward to the Kilmainham gig – “Patti Smith is our dream woman, such an inspiration” – but you get the impression that her sights are set on even bigger things. It’s rare these days for indie bands to showcase rampant ambition, but Whenyoung aren’t shy of making their feelings known on the subject of their future.
What level of big does she want to be, I ask at the end of our interview?
“Headlining Glastonbury big,” Power answers immediately, clear as a bell. There’s no arguing with that.
Whenyoung support Nick Cave and Patti Smith at Royal Hospital Kilmainham in Dublin on June 6

Highlight: Shame has held women back from telling their stories for too long – and this referendum is helping to shine an important light on untold truths 
Body


Back in college, almost two decades ago, I decided to get on a plane and go to a Marie Stopes clinic in London.
I wasn’t pregnant; I wasn’t planning an abortion or helping anyone else to have an abortion. The official reason for me being there was because I was working on a piece of writing at the time – for my masters degree – based around the theme of abortion. But I’d chosen to write the piece in the first place because it represented a way for me to face up to my worst fear as a teenager: the fear of becoming pregnant and being left in despair in rural Ireland with too few choices and nowhere to turn.
I grew up in a small town in West Cork, where the curtains twitched and people noticed your movements. The stakes were higher then, in the 1990s. If you got pregnant, what would you do?
There was no internet. You couldn’t buy abortion pills online. The Catholic Church’s influence was strong: priests and nuns ran the schools. Flights were expensive. Abortion was never spoken about. Silence was the order of the day.
By the time I was doing my master’s degree, it was the early 2000s. When I arrived into the Marie Stopes clinic, an orderly place noticeable only for its nondescript qualities – the eggshell walls, the amiable receptionist, the quietness with no radio, and just a mild whiff of tension in the air – I was asked to wait while the director was located for our interview.
During those few moments, I peeked through the glass window into the waiting room beyond.
That was when I saw her. A girl I knew. A girl who had been in the class below mine. She looked up, and her face – so pale already– whitened further as she glimpsed me. She looked away fast, down at her hands. We did not acknowledge each other.
We were both uncomfortable, I suspect for the same reason. I knew I would never tell anyone about seeing her. But I was afraid she would tell other people about seeing me. That was the case even though I was pro-choice; non-religious; and not pregnant. It didn’t matter. The rumour mill would have been enough.
I was so scared back then: scared of small towns and big whispers. Of people who based their opinions and actions on gossip, or the threat of it – and who refused to listen to their own logic, their own independent minds. You can be one way – pro-choice, non-religious – but when you exist in a society that hands out Shame cards with a capital ‘S’, like the letter ‘A’ for adulteress in The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, fear and self-consciousness can settle on you like a blanket.
It’s hard to ditch the influence of where you’re from. It’s hard to pick apart the clichés of Catholicism, the traditions we’ve all grown up with. It’s hard to remember that officialdom doesn’t necessarily have your best interests at heart. (And it definitely doesn’t, if you happen to be a woman in Ireland.)
It’s hard to use your brain when it’s easier to go with the flow; to accept establishment rules, to say sure it’s grand, no woman has ever gone to jail for ending a pregnancy, so let’s just ignore the fact that the legislation sits there, menacing as a rock poised in upraised fist.
The upcoming referendum is asking people to use their capacity for independent thought. It’s asking people to think about many issues, but perhaps chief about them is the question about when life begins.
Here’s a truth for you: we simply don’t know when life and personhood begin. It’s all a hypothesis, a guess, a bunch of beliefs.
Those who choose an extreme pro-life position – and who elect to enforce their hypothesis on every woman – are refusing, in effect, to look at the real, live, breathing woman in front of them. Even though this is the woman about whom there is no hypothesis, only her reality. The woman whom we know could, like Savita Halappanavar, die because of our willingness to follow beliefs rather than what is best for her medically.
“If we valued women as full human beings, we would not be having the debate you’re having in Ireland,” said the author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in Dublin earlier this week. She was correct.
My story is a small story. But here’s the thing. Every woman has a story, whether it’s an account of their fear in a bathroom waiting for the results of a test; or of a heartbreaking journey to England to end a pregnancy.
Lately, women and men have been breaking their silence and telling their stories. They’re doing it even though it hurts them and makes them afraid.
They’re doing it despite powerful shaming efforts. Despite trolls hurling disgraceful words at them in an effort to settle that ‘S’ letter back on their foreheads. Still, these women go on, telling their untold truths.
These past few weeks have made it very hard to be a female in Ireland. But when I see those women speak; when I read their words and I hear their testimony, it makes me realise something else: because of them, I am proud to be Irish.

TO TRY: Coto de Gomariz The Flower and the Bee Treixadura, DO Ribeiro 2016, €19 from 64 Wines, Glasthule; Green Man Wines, Terenure, Deveneys of Dundrum, Martins Off-Licence, Fairview and independent off-licences and wine shops (91)
Galicia in Spain has a cool summer climate, but behind its coastal landscape are mountains with sheltered valleys where, without wind, the summer sun can bring temperatures up to 30C for weeks. Increasingly fashionable red Mencia wines from this region are most famous, but fuller-bodied white wines from Godello and this grape, Treixadura, are rising stars. This is a superb example with ripe peach notes, touches of apricot and a dab of oily weight and light spice to finish.
Even a vague hint of sun seems to turn the thoughts of many Irish wine lovers towards the joys of sparkling wine. If money were no issue, having a Champagne Bollinger-packed fridge might be the solution. In reality, price is an issue. Happily, Langlois-Château in the Loire provides an answer. It is owned by Champagne Bollinger and makes excellent everyday sparkling wines from the local Loire chenin blanc and a dab of chardonnay. It has a white pear rush of fruit and a lip-smacking finish. At this price, it’s a summer steal.
The Cabernet Sauvignon grape from the New World has become identified with bland, unambitious, medium-bodied wines. But the reality is that the best New World cabernet wines have never been bland. Australian regions like McLaren Vale are stars of the fightback, and this wine is made using a little amarone-like grape drying to add depth. It bursts with blackcurrant, cherry and leather notes, with touches of dark chocolate too. Delicious, opulent fare.

What’s the catch?

Highlight: Meet two of Ireland’s most exciting restaurateurs, Niall Sabongi and Gaz Smith. The pair are reeling in plenty of hearts, minds and stomachs with their simple but satisfying approach to fish and seafood, writes Gillian Nelis 
Body


Niall Sabongi and Gaz Smith have lots of things in common – a love of uncomplicated food and an inability to take themselves seriously are just two of them. But the paths they took to becoming two of the biggest champions of Irish fish and seafood in the country were very different.
“I’d love to tell you that my mum used to pick herbs from the garden and my dad used to go out and catch fish, but we were brought up on potato waffles and turkey twizzlers,” Smith says. “I’d never eaten fish until I moved back to Ireland from England with my parents, when I was 16. I’d never seen soup made from scratch. I knew absolutely nothing about cooking.”
Sabongi, one of four children of an Irish mother and an Egyptian father, had a rather different experience. “Fish was always on the menu when I was growing up. Dad would bring home crabs and lobsters and barbecue them in the back garden, and he’d take us to the beach to eat mussels and limpets straight from the shells,” he says.
“I always loved fish, but I never liked the palaver around it in lots of restaurants – that whole silver service thing never appealed to me. Fish is the simplest of ingredients, and we’re always being told to do as little as possible to it. So why would you try to make it all fancy pants?”
Fancy pants are not something you’ll find in Smith and Sabongi’s restaurants. We are meeting in one of them, the Seafood Café in Temple Bar, which last week won Sabongi the seafood experience of the year award at the Restaurant Association of Ireland’s annual awards.
He has two more restaurants – Klaw, his tiny oyster bar round the corner, and Klaw Poké on Capel Street – while Smith’s restaurant, Michael’s, is located in the southside suburb of Mount Merrion. It also had a successful night at the restaurant awards, bagging the best newcomer and best restaurant manager gongs for Dublin, and the national award for best kids food.
They may have businesses in very different locations, but Sabongi and Smith’s food philosophy is the same: buy in the freshest fish and seafood as possible, in many cases direct from the boats; do as little to it as possible, and hopefully encourage customers to try something they haven’t had before.
The latter is easier said than done, because when it comes to fish, the Irish are creatures of habit. According to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, of the €380 million worth of fish sold in shops and restaurants here in 2016, €94.5 million was accounted for by salmon, and €47.5 million by cod.
“So much fantastic fish caught in Irish waters gets boxed up and shipped off to other countries because there’s no market for it here,” Sabongi says. “Megram is a great example. It’s a beautiful fish that you can cook in exactly the same way as sole, but it’s ten times cheaper. Red mullet is another species that doesn’t get used enough, but it’s probably my favourite fish.”
For Smith, velvet crab – the only swimming crab found in Irish waters – has lots to recommend it. “The Spanish and Portuguese go mad for them, “ he says.
“They’re quite small and fiddly, but I’ve started using them to make a crab bisque, and the flavour is just incredible. I love a nice bit of skate and ray as well; they’ll start to appear over the next month or so, and I’ll give them a nice herb crust and serve them in some brown butter with loads of salsa verde on the side.”
Smith has been back cooking in Ireland for three years now, having moved to Vienna with his wife Rita and two young children during the downturn to run a gastropub for a friend. Back in Dublin, he joined the Kinara Group before taking over the kitchen at the reopened Clonskeagh House pub. When Sean Collender, the co-owner of the Kinara Group with Shoaib Yunus, decided to sell what was then Michael’s Italian, he approached the Smiths, who had long wanted to open their own restaurant.
Sabongi, meanwhile, had opened Klaw the same year Smith returned from Austria. He was already in the business – Rock Lobster, which he’d started in Donnybrook, had by then moved to Harvey Nichols in Dundrum – but wanted to do something far simpler this time round.
“I’d been with friends one day and we really wanted some oysters and chowder,” he says. “We couldn’t get oysters anywhere. We did manage to get some chowder, but it was that awful, gloopy, thickened with flour stuff. I thought it was madness. A friend of mine told me about this small place that was coming up in Temple Bar, so I went for it.”
It took off immediately, with around 50 people eating in the 12-seater premises on its first night in business, and it continues to serve up oysters, lobster rolls and crab claws to a loyal clientele. Klaw Poké marks its first year in business shortly, while the Seafood Café opened last November.
For Smith, who has just marked his first year in business in Mount Merrion, a turning point was Seafood September, which saw him offer a free fish-based main course to kids with every meal their parents bought. He thought he might give away 30 meals; instead, it was nearer 300.
“The funny thing was that, as the kids got more adventurous, so did their parents, “ he says. “It just seemed to give people that little push they needed to eat more fish.”
Smith has already run the first in what he hopes will be a series of trips to one of the fishermen he buys from in Howth, with parents and kids helping to land lobster and crab, and then going back to the restaurant to cook their catch.
Does he have plans to expand his business?
“Yes, but not now. I’ve turned down two premises in the past six months because there is no value in Dublin any more. It’s all gone crazy again in terms of rents and key money,” he says.
“People keep asking us why we didn’t change the name of the restaurant when we took it over. The truth is it was because we couldn’t afford the €600 to change the sign. This is our family business, and it doesn’t make sense to us to pay out huge amounts of money for another premises in a city that is being flooded with new restaurants. Our plan is to sit back for 18 months or so and reassess things then. “
Sabongi is similarly cautious. He has pulled out of a plan to open a fishmongers, restaurant and cookery school on South Great George’s Street, and will instead spend the rest of this year bedding down his three restaurants before rolling out Urban Monger, a chain of small fishmongers, next year.
“The goal is to have five or six of them. I’ve got the first two premises lined up, and I should get the first one open next February. You’ll be able to come in and buy fish to take home, or you can have it cooked in front of you, and eat it there and then,” he says.
“George’s Street would have been fantastic, but it was a very large project that would have taken up all of my time. I don’t want to get to a point where I’ve no time to do any cooking myself, or where I can’t hang out with my customers. That’s not for me.”
Both are hopeful that the renewed wave of interest – if you’ll pardon the pun – in fish and seafood that they’ve seen since they opened their restaurants will continue.
Sabongi says that while he does get business from tourists, it’s predominantly Irish people who come through the doors of his three outlets, while Smith says he feels “incredibly lucky” to have huge support from his local customers.
“We don’t normally open on Sundays, but we had to the week after the snow in March, because we’d been decimated,” he says. “We ended up doing six sittings. The support was just unbelievable.”
We’ve been chatting for an hour, but it’s time to wrap up: Sabongi needs to go into the kitchen to examine a large eel that’s just arrived in and that he thinks will be delicious smoked, while Smith has to head to Mount Merrion to see what Rita has picked up from Howth earlier that morning.
The fruits of their labours will be on their customers’ plates within a few hours; as fresh food goes, it doesn’t get much better. n

[caption id="attachment_416599" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Niall Sabongi’s pan-roasted red mullet with wild garlic, mushrooms and smoked aioli[/caption]
“Irish mullet is possibly my favourite fish, and I gorge on them when they are plentiful in our waters.”
Ingredients, serves two as a starter or a light lunch
2 large red mullet, scaled and filleted
Good-quality rapeseed oil (Newgrange is my favourite)
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the aioli
1 smoked garlic bulb
2 egg yolks
Zest and juice of one lemon
400ml rapeseed oil
For the wild garlic and mushrooms
400g wild Irish mushrooms (morels are lovely at this time of year)
100g spinach
100g wild garlic
100g butter
2 shallots, peeled and chopped
Method
1. Cover your garlic bulb in salt and cover with foil. Bake at 180C 40 minutes, allow to cool and then squeeze out all the soft smoky garlic.
2. To make the aioli, put the garlic, lemon juice, egg yolks and lemon zest in a bowl, then blitz. Slowly begin to add your oil until the sauce is emulsified, adding a little splash of water at the end and seasoning well. Go light on the salt, though, as the smoked garlic will have residual saltiness
3. Oil and season the fish and place in a hot, non-stick pan skin side down. At the same time, in a small pot sauté your wild mushrooms with the shallots. Once they are three-quarters cooked, add your spinach and wild garlic and allow the spinach wilt.
4. By this time, your mullet should be almost ready. Don’t turn the fish – instead, lower the heat and add a knob of butter and squeeze of lemon. With a spoon, begin to baste the flat side of the fish (the fillets will take about four minutes to cook).
5. You can now assemble your plates with a large dollop of aioli, the mushrooms and wilted garlic beside it, and your fish on the top.
[caption id="attachment_416600" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Niall Sabongi’s spiced cod burger[/caption]
“We serve these all day long in Klaw Poké on Capel Street, and they are really easy to do at home.”
Ingredients, serves two
Half a cucumber, cut into ribbons
1 tsp white wine vinegar
Quarter tsp golden caster sugar
Sea salt
1 tbsp plain flour
Quarter tsp each ground cumin and smoked paprika
Quarter tsp black pepper
2 nice fact pieces of cod (haddock or pollock also work well)
Rapeseed oil
2 ciabatta buns, toasted
To garnish
Mayonnaise
Sweet chilli sauce
Rocket
Lime
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
Method
1. Toss the cucumber with the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt.
2. Mix the cumin, paprika, flour and black pepper together, then use the mix to dust the fish on one side. Drizzle some rapeseed oil on top. Place under a grill at 180C for six to eight minutes until cooked through.
3. While the fish is cooking, add squeeze of lime and some zest into your mayo and toast your buns. Put a good dollop of sweet chilli on the bottom piece of bun.
4. Dress your rocket with a squeeze of lime and season with salt and pepper. Put the rocket on the bottom bun, sit the fish on top, add the cucumber and lashings of the mayo, and devour.
“This dish relies on the freshness of the seafood, so have a chat with your fishmonger about what they have. You can substitute the black bass with mussels, for example; the clams can be swapped with cockles or mussels, and the smoked salmon adds a great finish to the dish.”
Ingredients, serves four
500g black bass fillets, cut into finger-sized pieces
120g crab claws
200g whole Dublin Bay prawns
150g Connemara clams
50g smoked salmon, cut into small dice: most fishmongers sell smoked salmon trimmings at the fraction of the price of slices; they are perfect for dishes like this
Glug of extra virgin olive oil and knob of butter
For the sauce
Knob of butter
1 small onion or two banana shallots, peeled and thinly sliced
2 cloves of garlic
Glass of white wine
500ml cream
Sea salt
Sprig of thyme
Juice and zest of one lemon
For the pasta and garnish
A 500g pack of good quality durum wheat linguine
Large pinch of flat-leaf parsley, sliced thinly
Pinch of salt
Handful of capers
One lemon, cut into four wedges
Method
1. You can make the sauce a day ahead by first sweating the onions or shallots and garlic off in a knob of butter very gently in a pan, without colouring.
2. Add the wine and bring the heat up to reduce it. Keep reducing until there is roughly a quarter of the original amount left. Add the cream and lower the heat, reducing the cream slightly - if you leave the wooden spoon in the pot at this stage, there is less chance of the cream boiling over.
4. Strain the sauce and add the salt, lemon zest and juice, and the thyme. Taste, and don’t be scared to add a pinch of sugar if the sauce is a little too zingy. Keep in the fridge till needed.
5. Heat a pot of salted water for the pasta. Put the sauce, crab claws, prawns and clams into a separate pot, there’s no need to heat it just yet.
6. Heat a frying pan, and add a glug of oil. Start cooking the pasta according to the instructions, but drain it a minute earlier than recommended, as it will be finished in the sauce.
7. Season the bass with salt and put into the hot frying pan, cooking it for three minutes either side, basting it with the oil. Add a knob of butter halfway through cooking and put a lid on the pan.
8. Put the pot with the sauce and seafood onto a gentle heat. Drain the pasta, add it into the pot with the sauce and seafood, then add a bit of salt, the capers, the smoked salmon and the chopped parsley. Divide between four bowls, pop a piece of the bass on top, and serve with the lemon wedges.

Highlight: When Viv Albertine, ex-guitarist with feminist punk band the Slits, re-emerged as a memoirist four years ago, her first book Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys was a raucous, laceratingly honest accounting of adulthood, motherhood, marriage and the female artistic self. Her new book, To Throw Away Unopened, is a far darker proposition, just as honest, but going places most of us would rather not go, writes Nadine O’Regan 
Body


Viv Albertine thrives on honesty. It’s her currency; it’s how she gets about the place. It’s kicked her in the teeth sometimes, this candour. But it’s also given her an increasingly successful literary career - the English writer has published two memoirs in the last decade, the first of which won the Rough Trade book of the year in 2014, and the second of which has newly arrived in bookshops to deservedly glowing reviews. Formerly the guitarist with 1970s agit-pop group The Slits, Albertine is the angrier, less publicised Caitlin Moran; the feminist who hasn’t yet been feted to the skies, but who nonetheless delivers prickly, insightful work that deserves to be read and reread.
Although I’ve never met Albertine in person, I feel through her two books that I’ve lived inside of her mind, cluttered, strange and provocative, as it sometimes is. I know when she first had sex (15), how her mother died (an agonising experience for the family), how much she sleeps (a lot, like a bear), how much she cares about her appearance (tremendously, but wants to appear casual), her concerns about herself as an artist (she frets about her talent), her thoughts on the patriarchy (she has spent a lifetime trying to kick holes in tradition), and her battles with loneliness (she was married for years, but is now separated).
So maybe it makes sense that when we do talk over the telephone, the subject we get onto almost instantly is that of her singlehood. Not for Albertine the warm gush of publicityspeak: she could have talked about the unexpected success of her first book, or dwelled on her relationships in the 1970s punk scene: as a former member of The Slits, Albertine was pally with Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols; her boyfriend was Mick Jones of The Clash, and their gang wore bondage clothes that came from the shop Sex, owned by scenesters Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren. But no, we’re straight onto the hard stuff, the feelings of solitude and isolation that come when you’re 63 years old and living on your own in London, with a rancorous family member - her sister Pascale - in Canada, and a nearly grown-up daughter, who’s getting ready to do her own thing in life, and maybe doesn’t need you so much.
“I do meet men, and men do ask me out,” Albertine says, in that questioning tone of hers, that feels like she’s having a debate with herself. “It’s not that no man would date me. It’s that I can’t date them. I’ve become so intolerant. When you deal in truth, or searching for the truth, falsehoods around you become less tolerable. It’s not that other people won’t have relations with you, but that you become so highly attuned to all the little lies. The word is possibly ‘compromise’, but compromise, in a way, is lying. It’s pretending. If you’re a creative person, it’s a drain to have a relationship with a man. When you’ve been dating since 12, fucking since 15, it’s not like I haven’t tried. It’s not sad to me [to not have a relationship], if it’s your choice.”
As for sex, Albertine isn’t bothered. “Men haven’t got any better at sex than they were back then,” she says. “A man at a party told me not to give up on sex. But I’m fed up of being pounded away at, I told him. I can’t be bothered to be good at sex and leap around. Sex has been turned into such a commodity. But people are beginning to say they’re asexual - there are now words for it and for people who don’t have much of a sex drive. For the first few months, I’m great in bed. But it’s better to start out being not good in bed and then get better at at it.”
That entire speech is quintessentially Albertine. She can’t let a cliché or a tradition sit uninterrogated; she must poke, pry and reveal. She must peek to find the insects scurrying beneath the stone. She doesn’t probe into your correspondent’s life, but she endlessly frets about her own. It’s an existence that - to be fair - has contained more reversals, interruptions and disasters than most. As she describes in her first book, the powerful Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys (notably, even Albertine’s title is intentionally unwieldy), the young Viv grew up in relative poverty in Muswell Hill in London in the 1960s. Her parents had an acrimonious break-up - and Albertine learned from her mother’s example to always take care of herself.
“She had such a great brain,” Albertine says. “She turned me into a little warrior. From the age of three, it was like: ‘Go out and have an interesting life. Never rely on men. Always have your own money’.”
In 1976, Albertine joined punk band The Slits, one of the few examples of a British 1970s all-girl group willing to take on a patriarchal establishment. Although The Slits couldn’t play their instruments for a long time, they burned with a feminist energy that meant they were a source of endless drama. Lead singer Ari Up was the most cheerfully shocking of the group, once dropping her knickers on stage and urinating. “With The Slits, you never knew what was going to happen,” Albertine says. “Ari would be pulled offstage to be hit and we would have to get her back. Shock value was very important - my artistic influence was all about confrontation.”
Adopting the punk ethos of the era, it didn’t particularly bother the band that they couldn’t play their instruments when they started. Chords themselves felt like cliches, learned ways of playing that needed to be interrogated. So the group inched their way forwards musically, messing around on fretboards to find out what sounded good to them. “All the other bands - the Pistols, the Buzzcocks - they all had people to copy,” Albertine says. “We were together for seven years and could play our instruments within two years - we weren’t idiots - but how we stood, how we played, how our songs were structured, everything was [new]. We tried to say difficult things and do difficult things creatively.”

These days, the band are regularly namechecked by other seminal bands. In the song Losing My Edge, James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem references The Slits alongside Lou Reed, Scott Walker and Joy Division as makers of records he owns as a badge of pride. But at the time, the band were mocked. “We weren’t taken seriously on any level,” says Albertine. “It got to the point in the 1980s where there was no interest and no room for us. It was constant ridicule and humiliation from men in the industry. We weren’t in it to be famous or to be entertainers. We were in it to be artists.”
In truth, The Slits’ importance was less musical than political, something Albertine herself seems to tacitly suggest in her writing when she describes how she took music lessons after the band’s break-up in the 1980s. “I’m aware I’m undereducated,” she writes, in her first memoir. “I hated that I couldn’t ever jam with anyone when I was in the Slits. I’m never going to enter a discipline again without knowing the background of the subject.”
After the Slits disbanded, Albertine undertook a degree in film and photography at the London College of Printing. She became a music video and television director, got married to a man she loved, and went through IVF treatment to have her child, before separating from her partner. “I’m losing every ounce of the person I used to be,” Albertine relates sadly, as their marriage disintegrates, with jealousy and possessiveness hurting them both. “I know she wasn’t all good, but she wasn’t all bad either.”
If Albertine’s first memoir was a fairly relatable account of that time - taking in personal themes of adulthood, motherhood and marriage - her new book is a more curious beast. To Throw Away Unopened is a harder book to love than its predecessor, not because it’s not as piercingly well written, but because it deals in the kind of truths that many of us would prefer to bury or avoid entirely. The memoir locates its axis on the night of Albertine’s mother’s death, which is laceratingly well described, and it is full of gut-wrenchingly awful sibling drama. Albertine and her sister Pascale (who have a frosty, competitive relationship) come to actual blows in a fight over their proximity to their mother, Kath, on her deathbed, in a horrifying scene.
Albertine and her sibling no longer speak, which has undoubtedly made this memoir easier to write, but nonetheless it’s a state of affairs that comes with its own sadnesses. “Death and siblings are so rarely honestly spoken about in Britain,” she says. “My sister lives a long way away, she won’t read the book. It isn’t the most loyal thing for me to do. But I do think it’s important to talk about sibling relationships. I wanted to open up the dialogue about that, and about death as well. There was my mother’s truth, my father’s truth, my sister’s truth, and there’s me - and none of it was the absolute truth.”
Albertine made use of her mother’s and father’s diaries in the memoir, the former located by Albertine after her mother’s death, hidden in an Aer Lingus bag, with the words ‘throw away unopened’ inked on it. Of course, Albertine did nothing of the kind, choosing fidelity to the page - and the living reader - over fidelity to her dead parent. (This is partly what may make some readers shy away from the entire project.)
If the writing was therapeutic in some respects, it didn’t salve all of Albertine’s pain or grief about her family and her losses: the loss of her mother, and the living loss of her sister. “It doesn’t make the sadness any less or the anger any less,” she says. “It was more like working through a puzzle. How the hell did I get to be this person? And how the hell should my sister and I be people who can’t even hold it in on the night my mum is dying?”
Such questions are uncomfortable. But Albertine convinces you through her writing - which is perspicuous and thought-provoking - that they are important and necessary.
“At my age, if I can’t talk about my evil thoughts, when can I do it?” says Albertine. “I want you to read my books. To turn the page. But at the same time, I want to experiment with style and form and content. I want to make work that’s useful. In that sense, I’m just carrying on with what I’ve always done: making serious work.” n

On men: “Boys in bands find it so easy to have girlfriends, there’s always a pretty - even smart - girl to be found who’s willing to be a sidekick, but it’s very difficult for girls to be in the music industry and keep a relationship together. Boys don’t like it, not many of them feel comfortable in the supportive role that’s required.”
On fashion: “Vivienne [Westwood] and Malcolm [McLaren] use clothes to shock, irritate and provoke a reaction but also to inspire change. Mohair jumpers, knitted on big needles, so loosely that you can see all the way through them, T-shirts slashed and written on by hand, seams and labels on the outside, showing the construction of the piece; these attitudes are reflected in the music we make. It’s OK not to be perfect, to show the workings of your life and your mind in your songs and your clothes.”
On art: “You have to be selfish to be an artist; your family just have to accept that. It’s not personal, it’s not that you don’t love them. What an artist gives their family isn’t routine and their constant presence, they give vitality and ideas, independence and creative thinking.”
To Throw Away Unopened (2018)
On parenthood: “It’s true what Gloria Steinem said of herself and many women of my generation - that we lived our mothers’ unlived lives, but for me that turned out to be a good thing. My mother’s unlived life consisted of not being in a band, not buying her own home, not being a filmmaker or an author, not experimenting with clothes or living life the way she wanted to.”
On singlehood: “If I wasn’t doing well in my work, I’d be considered a failure in this society because I don’t have many friends and I stay home a lot. If I ever say, ‘OK. Bit lonely,’ when someone asks me how I am, they wince with embarrassment. I’m not looking for sympathy, I state it as a fact, the same way I’d say I’ve got a cold or backache. It’s one of the consequences of the path I chose: to be creative in a society that didn’t support female artists (it’s still difficult). I’m lonely, so what. Although I’m not immune to the pressure to be seen to be doing things and having lots of friends. Life in the ‘advanced economies’ is so much about acquiring and achieving, succeeding and being busy and popular, even when you’re older. And then you die.”
On social media: “Gravestones were the Facebook profiles of the old days. Never believe what’s written on a gravestone - ‘Loving wife, mother and daughter’.”

This week, I will mostly be:
To my eternal shame, I never got into it. The cop sitcom was saved from the jaws of cancellation NBC last week, and I’m playing catch-up now. Four of the five seasons are available on Irish Netflix. Meanwhile, the good news comes that writing has begun on the fourth and final season of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. The first three are also on Netflix, and are just brilliant.
Gymnastic coach and Crossfit competitor Ornagh Lee’s Instagram account is the one thing that might get you into the freezing Irish Sea this summer. She makes daily sea swimming look so invigorating and good for you, and was even at it way back in January. JANUARY! Even if you never make it to the Forty Foot with her, her Instagram is a delight.
The Line Up Choir is a Dublin-based community singing group and a bloody good one. You might have seen them on the Late Late a few weeks back, or maybe they sang you over the finish line at Darkness Into Light in the Phoenix Park, or soothed your hangover at Electric Picnic. Their summer concert is in the RDS next Sunday 27 at 4pm, and I can’t imagine a better way to spend an afternoon.

'Bloody useless': Belfast tycoon's view on Northern Ireland politicians

Highlight: Founders of Belfast managed services firm Novosco, John Lennon and Patrick McAliskey have grown turnover at the company to £30 million per year by taking on the outsourcing giants, while at the same time retaining a personal touch with their clients 
Body


CV John Lennon and Patrick McAliskey
Roles: co-founders, Novosco
Ages: 47 (John) and 50 (Patrick)
Live: Belfast (John) and Lurgan, Co Armagh (Patrick)
Hobbies: Surfing and keeping fit (John); marathon running, travelling, listening to audio books and sometimes hanging out in a polytunnel (Patrick)
Favourite movies: Goodfellas (John); Silence of the Lambs and The Terminator (Patrick)
I’m ten minutes into a tour of the offices of Novosco with co-founder John Lennon when I accidentally barge in on a mindfulness class taking place in one of the smaller rooms in its headquarters, just around the corner from the Titanic Experience in Belfast.
Some hasty apologies follow, and we move on to the compact but well-equipped gym down the hall. Lennon and his Novosco co-founder Patrick McAliskey hired Black Box, a gym fit-out firm located across the road, to kit it out, and Lennon says it’s now used for everything from moderate work-outs to helping one member of staff train for ultra marathons.
“We don’t ram it down people’s throats, but we actively encourage the staff to make healthier choices,” Lennon says.
“We started the company in a couple of retail outlets knocked together; it was a bit of a rabbit warren with no natural light. Then we moved to a building across the way from here, where we had half a floor. We were able to watch them building this place, and we thought ‘right, now’s our chance to get what we really want’. So we decided we’d take the top floor.”
That physical ascent was the result of a sharp rise in the scale of Novosco’s business. When it was established in 2007, the tech company had 40 staff in a single office. By the end of last year, that had risen to just under 180 in offices in Belfast, Dublin, Cork and Manchester.
Turnover is now around £30 million per year, and given that it is still actively recruiting, that is likely to rise this year. But it remains to be seen how much of that turnover will be generated south of the border: for a company like Novosco, doing business in Dublin presents particular difficulties.
“The Dublin market is really challenging for a business like ours, and one of the biggest issues we are facing there is wage inflation. It’s through the roof,” Lennon says. “The big American firms are heavily recruiting a lot of the same people we are targeting, and they pay a base salary that is very difficult to compete with. And that’s not to say that we don’t pay well – we do – but there is only so far we can go.”
Another challenge in Dublin is what Lennon describes as the unrealistic expectations of some of the owners of companies he and McAliskey would be interested in acquiring. Novosco is debt-free and has what Lennon describes as “significant” cash reserves that they can use to further grow the business through buyouts.
The space it operates in, providing cloud-based IT services such as back-up and disaster recovery, as well as IT support, cyber security and managed services, is one that is ripe for consolidation, in Lennon’s view, but only at the right price.
“It’s a funny market, Dublin. It’s hyper-competitive, and everybody is cutting everybody else’s throat for a bit of business. Consolidation makes sense, but in a lot of situations the valuation expectations are completely unrealistic,” he says.
“There are too many companies fishing in the same pond, and there will probably be some fallout from that in terms of viability. But the problem isn’t going to get solved while people’s valuation expectations stay too high. And we certainly aren’t prepared to get into debt to buy them out. We’re terrified of debt.”
It was consolidation that brought McAliskey and Lennon together to set up Novosco. The former had started a company called Real Time Systems in 1994 and had built it up to have a turnover of around £20 million per year, while the latter had started his career in the Gateway 2000 plant in Dublin before moving back to Belfast to start his own company in 2002.
“I got that company to 15 or 16 people turning over around £1.5 million a year. It’s a small enough community where everyone knows everyone else, and Patrick approached me at a Microsoft conference in January 2007 to see if there was a way for us to work together,” Lennon says.
“Within a few months, we’d pulled the business together. It just didn’t make sense for two small companies like ours to be competing against much larger organisations. By pooling our resources, we were much better placed to go out and get the business that we hadn’t managed to secure on our own.”
The merger also gave the pair the means to significantly expand the range of services they were able to offer, and as a result, the range of customers they were able to target.
“At our core we’ve always been very focused on infrastructure services – things like storage solutions, data centre infrastructure and all the bits and bobs that go along with that – but we’ve evolved in terms of the product offering and the things we do in that space,” Lennon says.
“Over the past few years, we’ve really grown in terms of the managed services we offer. We’ve gone from offering a relatively modest support service to a full capability that now allows us to compete with the large outsourcers. As the economy has improved and as things like the cloud have come along, companies have become much more open to outsourcing, and we’ve been able to tap into that.”
Novosco’s managed services clients include Cork County Council, a large London-based housing association called Metropolitan Housing, and several National Health Service (NHS) trusts.
In 2016, it won a €3 million contract to provide information and communication technology support services to Swan Housing Group, which manages 10,000 homes in London and Essex, while that same year it spent €4.7 million on acquiring a Cheshire-based IT firm called NetDef. The large food producer Moy Park is another customer, while in education, it works with Trinity College Dublin and Queen’s University in Belfast.
You might presume that the high-profile IT security breaches that some companies have experienced in recent times would have lessened the appetite among firms for outsourcing. But Lennon says that in ways, those breaches have benefited companies such as Novosco.
“There are certain types of customers, and certain sectors, that aren’t and will never be interested in outsourcing. And as you point out, there have been some very public challenges for some of the mega-outsourcers around some of their contracts,” he says.
“But what we’ve been seeing is an appetite among clients for smaller, more agile providers for some of those large contracts. If they have a problem, they want to know that they can pick up the phone and get through to someone really quickly, rather than go through several layers. Your customers judge you most when they’re in a significant pickle and things are really difficult. If you’re not there to bail them out in those situations, you may as well forget about that business.”
That, of course, requires staff who are prepared to put in the extra work that can be required at times of crisis, a fact that ties back in to the gym, the mindfulness classes and the other extras that Novosco provides to its employees.
“Our people continually go the extra mile, and we continually reward them for it,” Lennon says. “We have an ethos of continual improvement in the business, and not just in areas that are directly related to what people are working on. We actively encourage people to do different things and take on different challenges, even if they’re not necessarily related to the job they’re currently doing. We think minding people’s health is really important.”
Health isn’t just an area Lennon and McAliskey are interested in because of their staff – some of their most exciting projects are also in that sector. On the day of my visit, a team from Novosco are ensconced in a meeting room with a group from a well-known international tech company looking at how they might work together on further developing a system built by Novosco that manages the flow of in-patients in hospitals.
“They’re looking at how they could put chatbots and artificial intelligence into the technology we’re working on,” Lennon says. “We’ve been developing it for a few years now, and last year about 35 per cent of our business came from the healthcare space. It’s a really exciting area, because the potential for using technology to improve how we move patients through places like hospitals is huge.”
It is also, Lennon concedes, hugely challenging.
“It’s an unfortunate metaphor to use, but across the island of Ireland the landscape of hospitals is littered with the dead bodies of failed IT projects. That’s at least partly because a lot of those projects were technology-led – a solution was provided by a vendor, and an attempt was made to then enforce it in a clinical environment,” he says.
“But that approach just won’t work. You have to go and talk to clinicians. You can’t just rock up and tell them that everything they’re doing is wrong – you have to understand their needs and how you can help them, and not overload them with unnecessary tasks.
“We had one project where at the beginning we gave a client a solution that was far too complex, and as a result, it failed. That taught us that in this space, you have to start slowly and grow incrementally.”
Lennon is an upbeat interviewee, but his cheerful demeanour wobbles a bit when we talk about Brexit, and how the North’s political parties are dealing with it.
“Northern Ireland politics depress me, and I think a lot of the business community feel the same,” he says. “To be honest, I just ignore the politicians here because they’re all bloody useless. There’s nobody fighting for us in Westminster. We’ve got no voice. It’s a complete disaster, but we just have to get on with it.”
Getting on with it for the remainder of 2018 will include continuing to grow Novosco’s business in Dublin and Cork – Lennon says one possible upside of Brexit will be an influx of firms to the south which may be in the market for Novosco’s services – and keeping an eye out for possible acquisitions.
There are no plans to move offices in Belfast again, Lennon tells me, as he points out the landmarks that can be seen through the floor-to-ceiling windows. “That’s the dry dock that the Titanic was launched from, and there’s the studios where they make Game of Thrones. You can see the water and the mountains; it’s a lovely view even when the weather isn’t great. We reckon we’re very lucky.”

AIB staff in battle for ‘living wage’ salary increases

Staff at state-backed AIB are to seek increases to salaries when the current pay agreement between the bank and the Financial Services Union (FSU) runs out next year.
Workers at the bank, which is still more than 70 per cent owned by taxpayers, will demand a cost-of-living increase to their salary, separate to any performance-related increase, with the union focusing on gains for low and middle-income employees.
“The contribution of staff to the turnaround in the bank’s fortunes has been immense,” said the FSU’s senior industrial relations officer Billy Barrett. “In the past decade they have endured pay freezes, longer working hours and fundamental changes to their pensions. Now is the time for the bank to acknowledge the contribution of staff and put in place a fair pay and reward structure.
“Unfortunately, AIB is refusing to accede to our demand for minimum cost-of-living increases for all staff. It is also resistant to our campaign to restore benefits taken from staff during the financial crisis.”
The union was angered by the move by AIB chiefs to seek share options for senior staff earlier this year, although this proposal was later shot down by finance minister Paschal Donohoe ahead of the bank’s annual general meeting last month.
In addition to the pay claim, the FSU said it was campaigning for a transparent and defined career path for all staff, including new entrants.
The union said it would be embarking on a campaign to mobilise staff behind the pay claim and is actively recruiting new members in AIB.
“The bank needs to understand the strength of feeling among FSU membership in AIB. They have endured much in the past decade.
“They now have an entirely justifiable demand for fair pay and the restoration of benefits.
“They are reasonable demands and AIB management needs to change its tune and engage with the union in a constructive manner,” Barrett said.

Alexander Mann’s Irish founder to stay on after €921m sale

Dubliner Rosaleen Blair will stay on to run the international recruitment empire she founded following the €921 million sale deal agreed for her Alexander Mann talent company last week.
Blair retains a circa €140 million stake in the company after its acquisition by Omers Private Equity, the investment arm of a Canadian state worker pension fund. It is not known how much she may have taken off the table as part of this sale.
Founded by Blair in 1996, London headquartered Alexander Mann Solutions is a recruiter and outsourcer operating worldwide in 85 countries (including Ireland) and working with some of the biggest global blue chip firms.
It has worked with companies such as Deloitte, Credit Suisse, Rolls Royce, Statoil and Vodafone, often deploying expert staff to work in the organisations.
This is the second acquisition mega deal for Blair. Private equity firm New Mountain Capital bought into Alexander Mann for close to €315 million 2013. Blair stayed on and, along with her fellow directors, reinvested in the group at that stage.
Blair began her career as a Montessori teacher in Dublin and later ran a clothes shop on Grafton Street. She went on to set up a nanny recruitment agency when she noticed a gap in that market.
She moved to London and former Dragon’s Den star James Caan backed her to set up her own division of his recruitment business, which became Alexander Mann. She later took that over in a management buyout.
She was awarded a CBE, a British honour, in 2017.

The monthly homeless report from the Department of Housing is an important document. It tells us how many adults and children are living in temporary accommodation funded by the Department. It has become a measure of whether the government’s housing policy is working.
While the monthly publication is widely reported as detailing the number of people who are homeless, it does not actually include all adults and children without a home.
There are a number of hostels in Dublin that receive no public funding, including Morning Star and Regina Coceli. The 66 men and around 100 women and children in these facilities are not counted in the department’s figures.
Nor are the approximately 1‚562 women and 2,223 children who during the course of a given year spend time in Tusla-funded domestic violence emergency and step down accommodation. In fact, Tusla doesn’t even publish regular numbers, only releasing an annual figure halfway through the following year.
There are also 520 families who have been through the asylum system and granted leave to remain. Unfortunately, due to the housing crisis, they are trapped in direct provision, effectively using it as a form of emergency accommodation.
The Departments of Housing, Justice and Children have repeatedly been asked to integrate their homeless figures into a regular publication. To date they have refused.
So we are left with a less than perfect monthly report from the Department of Housing detailing those adults and children living in what is known as Section 10-funded emergency accommodation. But at least we have a regular read of what is happening in that sector.
So who is included in this report and what kind of accommodation are they living in?
They are people who have lost their homes or who were never able to source a home. Some are experiencing addiction, mental ill health, abuse or violence. Others have lost their home due to eviction, rent hikes or relationship breakdown.
The word ‘home’ here means a stable, legally binding tenancy in either the private or public sector. In response and in order to avoid people sleeping on the streets local authorities directly provide or fund others to provide a variety of emergency responses placing homeless individuals and families in temporary accommodation.
In addition to the use of hotels and B&Bs, councils own or lease units of accommodation and place individuals and families in them on a temporary licence basis. There are also facilities owned and run by the voluntary sector. More recently there are family hubs – private properties leased by the councils and managed by the voluntary sector.
Some of this accommodation is ‘night-to-night’, meaning you secure it for one night, leave in the morning and secure the following night by contacting homeless services. Other accommodation provides temporary licences for six, 12 or 18 months. Unfortunately, the depth of the housing crisis means that some families are spending more than two years in emergency accommodation
In all cases, the accommodation is temporary and either the council or the voluntary sector provide support workers to assist you secure permanent tenancy in private rental or council housing.
All of this is understood by council staff, voluntary sector homeless services providers, housing policy academics and the opposition in the Dáil.
Until last week, we had all thought that it was also understood by the Minister for Housing and his officials. Astonishingly, this does not seem to be the case.
On publication of the March homeless figures Eoghan Murphy said that 600 adults and children had been removed from the count having been “erroneously mis-categorised” by local authorities.
No further explanation was provided. During oral questions on Thursday Murphy indicated that as many as 200 more people could be removed from the department homeless report.
Are council housing department officials that incompetent that they don’t know the difference between a family with a tenancy and a family in temporary homeless accommodation? Did they really mis-categorise 800 people?
The straight answer is no. Hard working council officials fully understand the difference. Indeed, in response to the instruction to remove 100 families from their homeless figures, Louth County Council issued a memo to their elected members clearly stating that these families were indeed homeless.
When the memo became public, Louth County Council were leaned on and released a terse statement saying they removed these families “in agreement” with the department. It appears that the minister was not content with questioning the competence of local government officials, he wanted to silence them as well.
Despite repeated requests for the minister to put all of the information in the public domain to justify his numbers cull he has so far refused. So TDs and journalists have had to go directly to the councils to establish the facts.
Information from Louth, Meath, Waterford, Kildare and Dublin City councils confirm that the vast majority of the families removed should not have been taken out of the March homeless report. They were and in many cases still are homeless and living in temporary emergency accommodation.
Little wonder then that Murphy is refusing to come before the Housing Committee for a dedicated meeting along with council officials and experts to explain his actions. What is he trying to hide other than a blatant attempt to manipulate the homeless figures to shore up his own political reputation.

Beware of the myth of Europe’s renaissance

Highlight: The current eurozone boom is not sustainable, and putting all our faith in Brussels is not a good idea
Body


In the wake of the major shifts in international and domestic policy in Washington, the European Union has become a new geopolitical and global trade leader, boosted by its robust democratic institutions, stable internationalist policies and an economy that is, allegedly, experiencing a new renaissance.
In response to this unexpected promotion in the ranks of global superpowers, Brussels has been quick to claim credit for its policies of increasing regulatory and institutional harmonisation as the source of the euro area’s newfound economic fortunes.
The reality, however, is a little different. First, a more careful analysis of the data shows that the euro area’s bed-of-roses economic growth comes with thorns: gains today come with future pains, and the current euro area boom is neither impressive, nor sustainable.
Secondly, the recent push for harmonisation and coordination of policies and policy tools across the eurozone has little to do with the uptick in growth experienced in 2017 and expected to continue into 2018.
Both of these facts suggest that Ireland needs to shape its own path within the euro area towards achieving a resilient growth momentum.
While the eurozone’s real GDP grew by just over 2.3 per cent in 2017, the highest rate since 2007, this economic expansion is far from being spectacular in either historical or international terms.
Considering the entire 18 years of history of the common currency, excluding the periods of the post-dotcom bubble bursting, the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis, eurozone growth averaged just under 2.29 per cent per annum.
Over the same period, the advanced economies outside the euro area were growing at an average rate of almost 3.9 per cent.
In 2017, these economies grew 0.4 percentage points faster than the eurozone.
Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing harmonisation of economic and fiscal policies is driving euro-area growth to new highs. Recent research by the IMF, for example, shows that of all the major advanced economies over the 2016-2017 period, the euro area was the most reliant on expansionary monetary policies as a key driver for growth.
Beyond 2017, the IMF forecasts imply that euro area dependence on low interest rates will remain more extreme than that of any of the other advanced economies, save Japan.
In terms of the sustainability of the current growth momentum, while the 2018 forecasts imply a further marginal increase in growth to 2.4 per cent, expectations for economic vitality decline from 2019 on.
The latest forecasts for the 2019-2023 period imply an average annual rate of growth in the euro area of just 1.6 per cent. Even at this sluggish rate of growth, the eurozone will be operating at above its long-term growth capacity, which is estimated by the IMF at 1 per cent annually.
The difference in growth rates across the countries that make up the group of advanced economies, excluding the euro area, has declined in the years 2010-2017 compared to the 2000-2009 period.
For the euro area as a whole and for the original euro area’s 12 states, it has increased. Thus, in the case of the eurozone, the period of accelerated harmonisation has been associated with the widening of growth spreads.
Research from the IMF shows that future economic activity in the eurozone is being “held back by low productivity amid weak reform efforts and unfavourable demographics”.
In other words, the very same dynamics that underpin the fall-off in growth in Britain and the US (which experienced a deterioration in labour and technological productivity in recent years), Japan (where the ageing population is weighing down the economy), and across the rest of the advanced economies, are pushing the euro area’s productivity growth down.
Aptly, European labour productivity barely expanded in the pre-2007 period, rising roughly 1.4 per cent per annum, a growth rate that was substantially below the headline growth in GDP. In 2017, at the peak of the post-crisis recovery, labour productivity expanded at an annual rate of just 1 per cent. The gap between GDP growth and productivity growth in the eurozone is widening. And in the years ahead, as the rate of unemployment continues to fall, with less experienced and more marginally-skilled workers being drawn into jobs, productivity growth is unlikely to pick up.
Labour productivity is not the only brake on the euro area’s growth capacity.
Based on the data from the European Patent Office, Europe is trailing behind the US and Japan in terms of published patents, in absolute terms and per employee. Worse, compared to the US, Europe’s innovation gap has been widening again since 2012.
On a per-employee basis, the levels of innovation-linked investment in the eurozone are lower than those in the US, Korea and Japan. If, in 1995, Europe was the second-largest innovation cluster in the world, by 2014, the latest year for which comparable data is available, it ranked fourth.
In simple terms, there is zero evidence that the euro area’s increased push toward harmonisation of economic policies has been driving a significant change in the region’s growth potential.
Worse, there is no evidence of an improvement in the euro area’s longer-term growth potential at all.
Faced with hard pressure towards the harmonisation of tax policies, Ireland is in the firing line of the European reforms. The current government’s method of addressing this pressure has been to attempt to steer our FDI-funded activities away from tax optimisation towards more value-added creation by MNCs. This, given the eurozone growth sclerosis, can only work if Irish productivity growth significantly outpaces the European average.
The latter requires a more effective absorption of foreign innovation into the economy. It also requires accelerating dramatically the rate of deployment of robotics, AI and other automation technologies that tend to displace less skilled workers.
To support longer-term employment in the age of robotisation, Ireland will need to materially change its education and skills training mix, increasing the number of Stem graduates and increasing overall mathematical and technological literacy across the incoming and existent workforce, down to the level of primary schools.
To increase our access to foreign skills, and to retain the globally-mobile indigenous talent, we will need to lower the income tax burden on workers earning between €50,000 and €150,000 – the range of salaries commanded by highly skilled employees in key sectors.
At the same time, we also need to deliver higher quality health, education, transport and other public services to support the better quality of life demanded by a modern workforce.
Finally, we need to restructure our tax and pensions systems to make provision for the fact that in tomorrow’s innovation- and technology-intensive economy, a larger share of our workforce will be working in flexible, less traditional workplace environments, and more higher earners will be migrating to contingent workforce arrangements.
None of these things are currently being prioritised by the government. Placing too much faith in the Brussels-driven mythology of the resurgent Europe is not a smart bet for Ireland.
Working within the euro area to drive our own productivity growth rates up might be a tough game to play, but it is the only way to improve our economic resilience in the medium term.

Beware the speed and sting of the hive mind in the heat of a major crisis

Highlight: Contrary to popular political and media opinion, the cervical cancer debacle has nothing to do with the state’s longstanding problem with Irish women 
Body


The Irish state has a historical problem with women. Repeatedly, it has been shown to be indifferent or hostile to their rights and welfare: on its good days, it has been paternalistic; on its bad days, misogynistic. But the cervical cancer crisis is not a case in point.
This could be a surprise to anyone following the crisis as it has played out in the media or on social media. It has been one of the worst crises to affect the health service in living memory, long-standing commentators have said. The service has been accused of a conspiracy of silence, an aggressive approach to court proceedings, a neoliberal outsourcing of vital services to American capital, the creation of a climate of fear among the women of Ireland, and, at the core of the crisis, an endangering of those women.
The problem is that none of this is necessarily true. The silence (the failure to tell cancer-afflicted women that signs of their cancer could have been detected earlier) looks more like cock-up than conspiracy: the “smoking gun” memos released on Thursday are about how to manage that disclosure (too slowly, admittedly, but with reasonable concern for the possibility of media and public misunderstanding), not about how to withhold the information.
The aggressive legal approach was primarily the fault of the American laboratory, not the HSE or the State Claims Agency. The outsourcing of testing to American labs was a crucial part of the creation of the screening process: according to Tony O’Brien, who quit as HSE chief on Thursday. Ireland did not have the capacity and the American companies involved have consistently met international standards.
The climate of fear has been created by politicians and media (facilitated by poor communications from the health authorities). And, crucially, there is as yet no evidence that a substandard screening programme endangered women. Cervical cancer screening is not 100 per cent accurate - anywhere in the world. There will always be cases of missed cancers. It may yet prove to be the case that the error rate was unacceptably high; but the health service has insisted that its data has not highlighted any serious flaws.
This much was largely clear by the evening of Wednesday, May 2, as O’Brien, accompanied by the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, and various other health officials, finished up a five-hour session before the Oireachtas health committee. The questioning had been good, if repetitive; the answers had been detailed, if often complex.
Yet RTÉ’s Six One News zoned in on the theatrics, not the substance: an irate Kate O’Connell telling O’Brien “this is not about you”; Alan Kelly calling the saga “a cover-up, or the worst case of incompetence”. O’Brien’s careful account of the workings (and failings) of the screening and audit processes was reduced to one line - and a clunky line, at that.
By Thursday, when O’Brien found himself again before a phalanx of TDs, this time at the Public Accounts Committee, the discussion had degenerated and the theatrics heightened.
A group of TDs who knew less about the issue than their health committee colleagues, but were more angry, persisted in asking questions that had been answered at length a week earlier (or earlier in the same meeting), and interrupted the answers to accuse O’Brien of a lack of accountability (despite him spending seven hours being held accountable to the Oireachtas), a lack of action (despite the litany of actions described), and of placing women in danger.
When Fianna Fáil confirmed later that day that they would back Sinn Féin’s motion of no confidence in O’Brien, his position became politically untenable.
But the outcome is nihilistic: O’Brien was best placed to oversee the response to the crisis; the HSE is now without a leader at a time of crisis; and recruitment of his successor will be more difficult for the way in which he was forced out.
Why has this story been so persistent, and so riddled with misunderstanding and misinformation?
In the first place, at the story’s core is the tragedy of Vicky Phelan and Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who have told their stories of terminal cancer with extraordinary dignity and courage. Their stories needed to be heard. But they also needed to be placed in context, and that the health and political systems spectacularly failed to do.
Inextricable from that tragedy - but not, as has been often implied, identical with it - was the gross failure to disclose to these women that their earlier screening had failed, that their smear tests had been “false negatives”.
As the story broke on the back of Phelan’s settlement, catching the HSE bizarrely unprepared, its response was led by car-crash interviews with key spokespeople, Jerome Coffey and Gráinne Flannelly (who later resigned as clinical director of CervicalCheck).
The government panicked. Health minister Simon Harris said he had confidence in the screening programme but not in its management (which can only have undermined confidence in the programme) and offered free repeat smear tests (further undermining confidence).
The opposition spotted weakness. “Women’s lives were put in jeopardy,” claimed Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald last week. Fianna Fáil’s Marc MacSharry, at the Public Accounts Committee, said there was “gross systemic failure . . . people are dying”. The impression given was that people were dying because of systemic failure. There is no evidence of that yet.
Throughout, the HSE and Department of Health failed to respond with clarity and transparency. O’Brien told the Health Committee smear testing was “70 per cent accurate”. It was four hours into the meeting before Holohan thought to clarify that the false negative rate was actually less than 1 per cent. “Seventy per cent accuracy” means that 70 per cent of cervical cancers (or incipient cancers) are correctly identified in testing; this means that 30 per cent of cancers are missed (about a hundred a year), he explained, not that 30 per cent of tests are wrong.
The HSE’s official line on the reliability of screening remains the generic statement that it is “safe and effective”, but has an (unspecified) “margin of error”. Such blandishments are paternalistic and dangerous; in an untrusting age, this promotes unnecessary scepticism.
And, consistently, reporting has elided the linked but distinct issues at the heart of the story, equating failures of disclosure with failures of clinical care, and a state of generalised confusion with a state of objective, substantive risk.
The resulting “scandal” could be simply the outcome of this unique set of circumstances, but it feels symptomatic of the age.
“At any given moment, there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question,” wrote George Orwell. “Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness.”
The old orthodoxy was that women’s lives should take them from dancing at the crossroads to rearing children; that the individual and state were answerable to the Church on moral and social issues; and that public discourse was a polite affair dominated by those qualified to partake.
The new orthodoxy is that both Church and state are hostile to women; that authority cannot be trusted; and that speaking our minds, quickly, loudly, and often aggressively, is a vital part of public discourse.
Orwell described the workings of orthodoxy as “the gramophone mind” - we all hum along to the same song.
Today, we have the “hive mind”: the speed and anger of social media trammels our thoughts and feelings towards the same end, colonising political debate and suffocating policy-making.
As Susan Mitchell writes elsewhere today, there remain significant questions to be answered and policy failings to be rectified in order for the cervical cancer crisis to be redressed. But there will remain outstanding another aspect of the crisis: that of the failure or inability of the political and media spheres to address a difficult issue with rigour and balance. That may return to haunt us.

Blackwater adds to Irish opera’s exciting progress

Highlight: The icing on the cake has to be the arrival of the Blackwater Valley Opera Festival, formerly Lismore Opera, now boosted by hefty financial backing that has injected not just lots of funding, but also vision and ambition not previously possible
Body


Ireland’s opera scene has been in galloping form over the past year. There was the recent launch of the long-awaited Irish National Opera; contemporary works by Irish composers have won major international awards and Irish-trained singers are increasingly employed for major roles in some of the most famous opera houses on the planet.
So the icing on the cake has to be the arrival of the Blackwater Valley Opera Festival, formerly Lismore Opera, now boosted by hefty financial backing that has injected not just lots of funding, but also vision and ambition not previously possible.
This has led to a five-day event this year from Tuesday, May 29 to June 2 with the centrepiece being four stagings of Rossini’s L’Italiana in Algieri, an opera brimful with that composer’s favourite ingredients: pride, passion, romance and flimflam.
This festival has its roots in the heroic endeavour and vision of two former executives of Opera Ireland following its collapse in 2010.
Dieter Kaegi and Jennifer O’Connell succeeded magnificently in staging an opera production annually in the atmospheric stable yard of Lismore Castle on the banks of the Blackwater river in Co Waterford.
But the increasing financial burden of keeping its mini-Glyndebourne ambitions alive (the festival includes al fresco dining options) had become oppressive and had placed the festival in jeopardy.
However, where there’s a castle, there’s usually a white knight, and in this particular case it is London hedge fund financier Michael Alen-Buckley, the festival chairman. The sheer style of the Lismore operation and the hidden charms of this relatively unknown part of Ireland captured him hook, line and sinker (the Blackwater is a fisherman’s paradise).
Alen-Buckley says: “New beginnings are always exciting. We decided to rebrand and relaunch to reflect the expanded nature of the festival we all love so much.
“Our new festival is supported by principal sponsors Kildare Village, JLT and David Ross Foundation, and wonderful patrons from around the world, all of whom share a common love of music and belief in its power to transform lives.”
L’Italiana in Algieri will be staged for four days in a mega-tent in the grounds of Lismore Castle on the banks of the Blackwater. It is a building with Hollywood appeal.
The opera is just one of a wide range of top-grade musical concerts, recitals and cultural events held in great houses along the Blackwater and adjacent to the charming heritage town of Lismore.
These include St Carthage’s Cathedral, Cappoquin House, Salterbridge House and Tourin House, all with architectural and historical appeal.
The opera is under the baton of Marco Zambelli, and will see the first starring role in Ireland of fast-soaring Dublin mezzo-soprano Rachel Kelly, daughter of pianist and music historian Una Hunt. Kelly has been winning major plaudits at home and abroad since graduating from Covent Garden’s top opera course two years ago.
The mostly Irish cast also includes Rachel Croash, Sandra Oman, Rory Dunne and Rory Musgrave with Puerto Rican tenor Javier Abreu.
•	Blackwater has also partnered with the Garsington and Nevill Holt Operas in Britain for a recital by two favoured singers, soprano Alison Rose and baritone Tristan Hambleton.
•	Swiss cellist Nadege Rochat joins with Dearbhla Collins for a programme of recently rediscovered music by the enigmatic and reclusive Dublin composer Ina Boyle on May 31.
•	Pianist Maire Carroll, an RDS bursary winner, will present a concert that includes not just Gershwin and Hammerstein, but two 1916 pieces specially written for her by young composer Sebastian Adams.
•	Among Irish classical artists taking part in the festival are baritone Gavan Ring, violinist Elizabeth Cooney and clarinetist Deirdre O’Leary.

Bots, fake ads and the war for the Eighth Amendment

Highlight: Despite Google’s blanket ban on referendum ads, the online space will remain a crucial battleground 
Body


Political campaign laws for the digital era are desperately needed, the government has been warned, as the entirely unregulated space of Facebook becomes the key battleground in the final two weeks of the abortion referendum campaign.
Google announced last week that it would ban all ads relating to the May 25 referendum on whether or not to repeal the Eighth Amendment. Facebook said it would stop all ads from outside the country in relation to the vote, in a move aimed at pre-empting any moves by regulators to force it to act.
“We understand the sensitivity of the campaign and will be working hard to ensure neutrality at all stages,” Facebook said in a statement. “Our goal is simple: to help ensure a free, fair and transparent vote on this important issue.”
But should it really be up to the social network - one of the world’s most valuable and powerful companies - to set its own “goal” to ensure a vote taking place in Ireland is fair and transparent?
Should Mark Zuckerberg – the New York-born billionaire who visited Ireland as a tourist in 2011 and turns 34 tomorrow – be the arbitrator of debate around what is enshrined in Bunreacht na hÉireann?
The question is entirely relevant. The sheer saturation of referendum-related content, and the number of users engaging with it on the social network, show how powerful it is as a tool to win over the hearts and minds of voters. Almost all users in the country will have ads – mostly anonymous – popping up in their feeds and attempting to influence their decision. We don’t know who or what is trying to exert that influence. In the words of a headline from MarketWatch website, “Ireland’s abortion referendum is under siege from bots and fake ads”.
Facebook is a rules-free zone. So far it has been left to its own devices in terms of regulation, with absolutely no effort by the government to subject it to the standards of truth, fairness and transparency that apply to newspaper, radio and television coverage of the referendum or to the placing of posters on lampposts around the country.
This leaves a situation in which anyone can disseminate false or misleading information to targeted groups of voters, based on their age and location, interests and opinions, without fear of rebuttal. For a subject as divisive and emotive as abortion, such unchallenged information could have a significant impact.
Allowing it to go unchecked leaves us open to the possibility, after May 25, of questioning the legitimacy of the result, whatever it might be.
So just how pervasive are these Facebook ads? The company has so far refused to say how much money has been spent on ads relating to the referendum. And that is “the million dollar question”, according to Craig Dwyer of the Transparent Referendum Initiative (TRI). The nonpartisan organisation relies on Facebook users to volunteer to have their data tracked so it can assess the proliferation of ads in their feeds.
One hundred per cent of the pages so far monitored have been targeted with ads, from which it deducts that there has been a near-saturation of ads on the pages of Irish Facebook users. So far it has identified 620 ads relating to the referendum. There has been a surge as polling day draws closer, with 150 new ads appearing in the past five days alone.
“Facebook will be the battleground for the next two weeks,” said Dwyer. “With the decision by Google to ban all ads, we are going to see the battle on Facebook intensifying even more.”
TRI can identify what is “sponsored content” but to most Facebook users these ads can look like a personal post from an individual user. Even if users do know that it is an ad, there is no way of tracking where it came from.
One things users are told is why they are being shown the ad, if they click on ‘why am I seeing this?’. As we reported in The Sunday Business Post last week, people were being shown anti-repeal ads if they had expressed an interest in Dublin GAA or Liverpool FC and were shown pro-repeal ads if they had expressed an interest in Brown Thomas and other online shopping sites.
Among the groups TRI found to have paid for ads is Expectant Mothers Together, which targeted at least seven different Facebook ads to the group of 577 users sampled. The group runs anti-abortion campaigns in the US, and warned of an “existential threat” to the unborn from Ireland’s vote.
Another is from the Jerome Lejeune Foundation, a US organisation that describes itself as an advocacy and research group for children with Down syndrome. Ads also appeared from Live Action, a group led by activist Lila Rose, best known for placing hidden cameras in family planning clinics.
Also targeting ads at Irish Facebook users is the Radiance Foundation. The controversial organisation has been accused in the US of exploiting the Black Lives Matter movement to promote a pro-life message after it ran a campaign saying: “As long as there is abortion, only some black lives matter.”
These ads will now be banned following last week’s announcement. But Gavin Sheridan, founder of Vizlegal and a digital transparency campaigner, said there wouldbe ways around the rules. “It will not prevent individuals or organisations from donating to groups in Ireland to run the ads from here,” he said.
“There is very little visibility on how many ads are being run, no idea on who is behind them, no idea about the amounts of money being spent. It’s just opaque.”
Dwyer also believes there is the potential for this to happen.“Hopefully it will make it more difficult to interfere from outside of Ireland, but in an ideal world you would have far more information about who is paying for the ads,” he said.
Besides, the majority of anonymous ads are from domestic sources, according to TRI’s database, so it does not solve the transparency problem.
There is no way of quantifying how influential these ads might be in the campaign. But a look at the level of engagement will tell you just how influential they are. Protect the Eighth had three videos which had half a million views in just one day.
The government has set up a group, to be chaired by the Taoiseach, to look at online campaigning. It said the group would “consider the substantive issues arising from recent experiences in other democratic countries with regard to the use of social media by external, anonymous or hidden third parties”.
But it is facing growing calls to do much more, to regulate for political advertising online and to bring overall election laws up to modern-day standards. The independent senator Alice Mary Higgins and Fianna Fáil TD James Lawless have issued a joint statement calling for the swift passage of laws to regulate online political advertising. “We need to look at an electoral commission to look at this,” said Higgins.
Lawless, who has tabled a bill to regulate online political advertising, said the announcements by Facebook and Google were welcome but temporary and served “as another reminder that legislation is needed”.
“The government has had its head in the sand for far too long on these issues and needs to urgently update the electoral acts for the modern age,” he said.

Breaking out of the ‘tragedy/process/recommendation’ loop

Highlight: Changing the crisis pattern we use, from ad hoc report/inquiry/tribunal to well-resourced agencies with investigative powers, is the only way to go. The lack of accountability undermines public trust in the institutions of the state
Body


Calls for accountability. Calls for consequences. Calls to set up inquiries. Calls for reform. Calls for increased pay. Calls for better terms and conditions.
Tracing the pattern these calls make traces the pattern of our national conversation. Health scandals, housing scandals, child protection scandals, political corruption scandals, every Garda story you’ve heard since the early 2000s. They rumble on. The best we can do seems to be to give lawyers millions of euro to stand for years in front of the seemingly inexhaustible supply of retired judges in inquiries which will find, well, whatever they find.
There’s a strong sense that what they find won’t much matter. Consequences seem largely absent. Elaine Byrne wrote about the need for a different model of accountability in last week’s Sunday Business Post. Having written (literally) the book on corruption and on tribunals and inquiries, Byrne has the predictable public crisis pattern down. Here’s how she described the pattern: “It begins with a campaign by an advocate or an individual directly impacted by a wrongdoing. They bring the matter to public attention . . . the Something-Must-Be-Done-Now virus infects everything . . . the government reacts in a panic and establishes an inquiry in an effort to stem the contagion. The tribunal reports. The recommendations say something obvious . . . The recommendations are ignored.”
Something is wrong. Something must be done. Something is set up to park the issue. Something is recommended. And those recommendations go ignored.
Why can recommendations go ignored?
Lack of accountability undermines public trust in the institutions of the state. Recent Eurobarometer surveys showed only 45 per cent of respondents trusted their government.
The map shows the differences in this score by EU country. Slightly more respondents - 51 per cent - trusted the public administration the government oversees. Ireland is above average on these measures across Europe. Other countries hit by austerity have far lower scores. Both measures have been rising over time as the economic crisis abates for most people in Irish society.
The more educated respondents trusted the government more than the less educated, as did those who had less trouble paying their bills.
There’s a very old debate about how best to assure accountability. The caricature comes from the debate between Herman Finer and Carl Friedrich in the 1930s and 40s. Finer thought you only got accountability from hard external constraints. The practical outcome of Finer’s ideas are Hiqa monitoring the HSE and the HEA monitoring the universities and institutes of technology. Finer puts us into a world of regulators and oversight authorities.
Friedrich thought establishing good norms and values was all you needed, and professionalism and a sense of duty would do the rest.
In practice, we do both in Ireland. We rely on the probity of our public servants, and insist they be regulated and overseen. There are frameworks for accountability out there, in force, on the books.
Accountability means different things to different people. Two scholars of the history of accountability, Christopher Pollitt and Peter Hupe, call accountability a “magic concept”.
Like the concepts of ‘freedom’ or ‘dignity’, it’s very hard to be against ‘accountability’. To see the asymmetry, ask yourself, who would be taken seriously arguing for less accountability? Magic concepts like accountability and governance have a high degree of abstraction, so they can mean what you want them to mean, a strongly positive norm, a seeming ability to dissolve problems just by invoking them, and you can use them in different areas like health or housing when the need arises.
Accountability is a portable manhole of a concept. To its credit, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in its 2014 paper on Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance spends a fair bit of time trying to get at exactly what accountability means for it.
Despite potentially meaning all things to all men, there are internationally comparable measures of accountability out there. The Australian scholar Andrew Williams produced a global measure of accountability, and the change in his measure of accountability for EU countries from 2000 to 2010 is shown in the chart above. You can see it’s not great for Ireland, but it’s not the worst, either, having fallen by 5 points over the decade. We are in the same grouping as Greece, Iceland, Portugal and Spain again.
Somewhat prophetically foreshadowing the Vicky Phelan case, in its 2014 paper DPER wrote: “In particular circumstances following, for example, an avoidable disaster or tragedy, accountability can also provide the opportunity for public catharsis.” The opportunity for catharsis comes from consequences. Because if accountability is a bottle of smoke, consequences, on the other hand, are very concrete indeed.
Setting up ad-hoc inquiries is very expensive, time-consuming and unlikely to lead to increases in the public’s satisfaction that either justice had been done, or the right people had been found out and punished. (Seriously though: where do all these retired judges come from? Is there a bewigged Rolodex?) When I say inquiries and tribunals take time, a reminder: the Moriarty Tribunal lasted eight years and the Mahon Tribunal lasted 15 years. A further reminder: the Mahon Tribunal’s finding that “. . . corruption affected every level of Irish political life [and] those with the power to stop it were frequently implicated in it”. Perhaps this has changed, at least.
If inquiries and tribunals are ineffective in imposing consequences, investigations by well-resourced and trusted statutory authorities do seem to have at least some effect. The most recent example is the Central Bank’s investigation of the dodgy dealings by the banks with at least 37,000 of their tracker mortgage customers overcharged an estimated €700 million. A fine and redress scheme is now in place.
The sheer number of reports, commissions, inquiries and tribunals since the 1970s is astonishing. The costs in the modern, say post-Bertie Ahern, era, are easily in the hundreds of millions and dwarf any of the budgets of any supervisory agencies.
Changing the crisis pattern we use, from ad hoc report/inquiry/tribunal, to well-resourced agencies with investigative powers is the only way to break out of the ‘tragedy/process/recommendation’ loop we are in.
We must also realise that our public servants do a good job when compared to their colleagues internationally.
A recent survey of the Irish civil service by the DPER showed positive results for the vast majority of the areas our civil servants are responsible for. Only three negative areas stuck out: the service is bad at introducing innovations, poor performance isn’t managed well within the system, and civil servants don’t think the public appreciates what they do.
These are problems of public sector management that can and have been solved in other countries. Australia reformed its public services in the 1970s, and is just about to start a large reform programme to change the entire structure of the public sector.
When the public see poor performers being either helped to improve, redeployed to make better use of their skills, disciplined, or fired, their trust in the system will improve. When the public enjoy the benefits of innovations in the public sector - for example, the speedy new passport renewal system - their trust in the system will improve.
When the public trust the system, calls for increased pay and better terms and conditions for those in the system will not be met with as much scorn as we see today. The management of the public sector is an enormous, and enormously important, job. Those charged with doing it should be rewarded when they do it well, and sanctioned heavily when they fail. Consequences for some benefit the system as a whole.
As the 2014 DPER report said: “Accountability can also provide the opportunity for public catharsis.” The alternative to consequences is another cycle of tragedy/inquiry/ignored recommendations.

British tourism operator Big Bus Tours is to acquire City Sightseeing Dublin, the hop-on hop-off bus sightseeing business.
City Sightseeing Dublin, which is registered under Irish City Tours, is owned by the Dualway Group. The family-owned company also operates Dualway Coaches, one of the largest private hire businesses in Ireland, Airport Hopper, a daily shuttle bus service to and from Dublin Airport, and Grayline, which operates day tours out of Dublin city centre to tourist attractions.
Big Bus will purchase the majority share in City Sightseeing, but Dualway will maintain a minority stake and David McConn, chief executive of the Dualway Group, will remain on as managing director of City Sightseeing.
“We took the decision to maintain and grow our share of passenger numbers in the city. The decision would have been taken by the board of directors and we felt that getting another proactive global brand such as Big Bus would be the preferable next stage of growth for us,” McConn said.
Big Bus, which currently has operations in 19 cities across the world, plans a major investment in City Sightseeing, including adding wifi on all vehicles and a new app.
The Dualway Group has a total fleet size of 65, including 25 City Sightseeing vehicles. It has 170 employees and that will increase as the Airport Hopper service expands in July.
McConn said it was not seeking any other takeover offers at the moment.
“The Dualway Group is 40 years in existence and we have some big growth plans for the next number of years and we are very much committed to those growth plans.”
The acquisition is subject to the approval of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.

A national poll by Property Partners estate agency group has revealed that up to a third of private treaty house sales fail to complete as a result of contract issues.
The group is now calling for an overhaul of the way houses are bought and sold in Ireland to bring greater efficiency and transparency for both vendors and purchasers.
The poll, conducted to coincide with a new brand launch, also found that it can take up to 200 days to complete the entire sales process.
“The existing private treaty process places far too much stress on both parties and even more so if the deal falls through, which can happen very late on,” said Property Partners chairman Ronan Long.
“We are calling for sales contracts to be made available from the outset before any bidding takes place.
“This is how most online auction sales are now being conducted, resulting in less time wasting and faster completion times.
“Not only would it remove a great deal of stress and uncertainty for both parties but the time spent on the entire process could reduce by up to 50 per cent.”
According to Long, the introduction of such a radical change is likely to meet with resistance. “[However,] with consumer expectations changing, we believe the market will demand this and it will become de facto in the near future.” he said.
“Under the current system for private treaty house sales – which account for in excess of 90 per cent of all residential home transactions – a buyer’s solicitor only gets sight of the contract after a sale is agreed. Impediments to a successful sale often only arise a considerable amount of time into the process.”
The real estate group believes that if contracts were made available to interested parties to review online from the outset, it would enable issues to be identified before negotiations even begin.
“The online auction model of providing contracts for review via secure web access only became commonplace in recent years, but it is now how most online auction sales are conducted,” said Long.
The Property Partners rebrand is being rolled out across its 25 branches nationwide. As well as a new website, the rebrand encompasses a new brand identity and colours, which will be incorporated into the company’s shop fronts, signage and other marketing materials.
With the company in growth mode, including the most recent addition Property Partners Payne in Lucan, Dublin, the rebrand is designed to refresh the company’s image and remind customers that it is successfully operating and growing in Ireland and continuing to look after both buyers and sellers nationwide.
“We felt it was time to inject new life into the brand to reflect where we are today and where we are heading. While our reputation for professionalism, exceptional service and local market knowledge remains, both the market and customers expectations have changed significantly,” said Long.

Highlight: Can certain foods and nutrients really boost your mood? Dietician Orla Walsh goes behind the headlines to examine the evidence 
Body


Over the past ten years, there have been myriad headlines touting the benefits of diet and nutrients for mental health. But what is to be believed and what is to be binned? It’s worth looking behind these headlines to see how much evidence there actually is for some of these claims.
In an article headlined ‘A taste for salt can keep you feeling chipper’, a newspaper reported that researchers had suggested that salt may act as a natural antidepressant. But that headline was a leap.
First, the study that this story referred to didn’t suggest that people should use salt as an antidepressant. Rather, it discussed some evolutionary reasons why there may be a sense of ‘reward’ after eating salty foods.
Secondly, this wasn’t a systematic review and therefore wasn’t robust evidence. Not all relevant studies were included – instead it was a selection of studies which supported the author’s thoughts.
And finally, despite the headlines, it’s important to note that none of the studies discussed suggested that a lack of salt causes clinical depression, or that people with clinical depression could improve their symptoms by eating more salt. In fact, as most people in Ireland consume more salt than they need – which can be harmful in the long term – this report is rather unhelpful when it comes to our health.
In science, the results that carry most weight are from systematic reviews. This type of research pools the better quality evidence that is available and analyses it together to answer a question.
A piece headlined ‘Do anti-depressants work better when taken with supplements?’ looked at studies that examined the impact on mental wellbeing of taking omega 3 fats and folic acid supplements.
In total, eight studies looked at omega 3 fats, of which six showed a statistically significant reduction in depression scores in those that supplemented their diet with omega 3 compared to the placebo groups within these studies. When the results were pooled together and analysed, there was a statistically significant effect of omega 3.
Omega 3 fats are naturally found in oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, trout and fresh tuna. Alternatively, you may wish to try a fish oil supplement.
There were four studies looking at the impact of folic acid, of which two showed a reduction in depression scores for people taking folic acid. As the studies differed in size, when all the results were pooled together and analysed there was no statistically significant effect of folic acid.
Folic acid is naturally found in green vegetables, citrus fruit and yeast extract. Women of childbearing age should take a 400mcg supplement daily.
Many people would have been alarmed to see a headline proclaiming that eating a diet high in processed foods increases the risk of depression. It came after a study found that eating a diet based on processed foods was associated with developing depression in the following five years.
A cohort study like this can make a strong case for causation, but it cannot prove that one thing leads to another. Similarly, it cannot rule out reverse causation – in other words, which came first, the processed food or the symptoms of depression?
In this study, researches collected information on diet and lifestyle from nearly 3,500 people, then five years later went back to them and collected data on their mental health.
They found that people who ate more wholefoods were less likely to have depression. This was the case even after all the factors that may have influenced this link were taken into account. They also found that people who ate the most processed foods were more likely to have depression.
Although this bit of research cannot say with 100 per cent certainty that eating processed food is linked with depression, eating a diet that is rich in wholefoods will come with countless benefits. Although there are many ways to describe wholefoods, a simple explanation is that wholefoods can be directly taken from a farm.
It’s safe to say that some of us are not our most lovely selves until we have our morning cup of coffee. But does coffee go a step further and actually make you less likely to suffer from depression, as some headlines have claimed?
A large prospective cohort study including more than 50,000 women was undertaken in a bid to see if there was a link between the two. Across a ten-year period, consumption of coffee was measured every two years using a validated questionnaire. The researchers considered other factors known to affect depression risk in their analysis, such as social involvement and physical activity.
The results showed that women consuming two to three cups of coffee each day had a 15 per cent less risk of depression, and those consuming four cups or more daily had a 20 per cent lower risk than women consuming one cup or fewer a day.
This benefit was not found for those that drank decaffeinated coffee. It’s also worth noting that previous studies have been conducted in men which reported similar results.
This type of observational study cannot prove that coffee lowers the risk of depression. However, this link between coffee and depression is interesting and worth noting, and for those that do enjoy a few cups, this is some positive news.
Try to drink your coffee in the first half of the day, as caffeine before bed can negatively affect sleep, which in turn can have negative implications on mood.
A small study which looked at the effects of psilocybin, a chemical found in magic mushrooms, on people with severe depression generated plenty of coverage.
The important thing to note is that the researchers didn’t give magic mushrooms to people – they provided them with the extract psilocybin. The scientists scanned their brains using an MRI and measured their depression using a questionnaire the day after the second treatment, and again five weeks later.
The great news is that all 19 people within the study reported immediate improvements to their depression, and almost half of the people within the study still felt better five weeks later.
One of the most important things when conducting a study like this is to have a comparison group; unfortunately this study didn’t have one. This is problematic, as the people within the study were also being given special psychological care during and after taking psilocybin.
Therefore, it’s difficult to say if the psilocybin was causing all or any of the positive results. A bigger, more controlled study is needed in the future to see if there is any magic to this extract from the mushrooms.
‘Over-the-counter magnesium tablets significantly improve depression in just two weeks’ – or so a typical headline claimed after the publication of a small study that found that people taking the supplements, in addition to their other existing treatments, reported an improvement in their symptoms of depression.
Researchers asked 126 adults with mild or moderate depression to spend six weeks taking a 500mg supplement of magnesium and then to stop taking it for six weeks. The researchers then monitored people’s depression symptoms with phone calls every two weeks.
This study would not be considered high quality as there was no dummy pill, meaning the placebo effect could be in play here. Did the participants feel better because they expected to feel better?
Nevertheless, magnesium is thought to play a role in mood regulation, so it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that taking this supplement did have an effect. On average, the participants reported a six-point improvement in depressive symptoms on a scale of 0 to 27 after six weeks. That’s comparable to a two-point improvement on a scale of one to ten, which is clinically important.
With all things science and health, the first motto is do no harm. Taking a small amount of extra magnesium through a supplement is unlikely to cause any adverse effects. However, this study used 500mg of magnesium each day, which is a lot. Magnesium supplements are not suitable for everyone, especially those with a history of kidney disease. The safest way to put this theory to the test is to simply eat more green vegetables and milled pumpkin seeds, as they’re a natural health source of this important mineral.

Capricious Trump plays at peace in North Korea

Highlight: But sanctions against Iran have put the US out on a limb, in league with Israel and Saudi Arabia, and at odds with the rest of the world 
Body


Here we go again. Last time out, the Bush family came up with an elaborate excuse, a tale of weapons of mass destruction and secret nukes. It was, of course, utterly bogus, but we only found that out afterwards. After the war, after the tens of thousands dead and the millions uprooted, a vast region of the world has been unstable ever since.
This time around, the Trump family of Manhattan had no need of narratives to frighten us. It was all as arbitrary and as narcissistic as usual. Apparently it all began when son-in-law Jared, the real estate agent and Ivanka’s husband, began visiting Israel and Saudi Arabia. I suppose at least it’s a new idea sending a real estate man to try and solve the Middle East.
He came home to his father-in-law with a new idea, a remarkable plan to put manners on Iran involving the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Now who would have ever predicted that marriage of convenience? Besides it’s positively medieval: the son-in-law at the Trump court making US foreign policy.
The thing is that the war the Bush family unleashed in the Middle East caused such levels of instability that we have ended up with a massive sphere of Iranian influence from Syria to Iraq. Now, apparently, the Trump family have to do something about it. A little American correction is needed apparently.
Of course, ever since Trump took over we all sensed that sooner rather than later he would be unable to resist temptation. The distance from game show television to becoming the most powerful man in the world must be dizzying, so can you really blame him if he wants to try out his new toys? After all, he’s running the ultimate game show on Earth.
But irrespective of how much we expected him to break out, when it came it was truly extraordinary. Since Trump’s announcement, scrapping the US’s part in the Iranian nuclear agreement, the political and diplomatic world has barely extinguished its midnight oil. Or contained its astonishment.
Apart from all the other implications, Trump’s decision creates a vastly complex global scenario and a highly dangerous one. It’s not just its potential impact on the Middle East that is sending out warning signals, but Trump’s action also has hugely significant knock-on implications for the rest of the world’s freedom to trade, and in particular for the EU. What now the prospects for the much-vaunted and promised EU independent foreign or trade policy?
This is a US foreign policy decision that has confounded its allies and left America itself isolated.
Not only that, but to abandon in a cavalier fashion an international agreement of such importance involving all the major players in the world has destroyed any international kudos the Trump presidency might have been gaining from the apparent North Korean détente. He’s now even worse than we might have imagined.
With new US secretary of state, Iraq invasion specialist John Bolton at his side, the boys are definitively back in town. Maybe we should all take to sleeping under the stairs.
Trump may not have known it, but across the world in the hours following his Iranian rejection, all sorts of long-held assumptions and axioms about the US’s direction were being quietly shelved; dates were being excised from diaries and plans were being put on longer fingers.
If Trump’s intention last week was to frighten Iran, he frightened a whole lot more. This time around, his capricious instinct has revealed a profound lack of judgment and even of any comprehension of what is at stake. Here is the man making America great again, making America grovel again.
On Monday last, he spelled out only part of this agenda when he signed off on a whole series of new crippling economic and trade sanctions against Iran. What he didn’t spell out are the wider implications for the five countries which remain in the Iranian agreement: Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain.
Despite all the brave words coming out of their capitals about maintaining the Iranian agreement, how can they continue to trade in the context of the US erecting a new wall of sanctions around Iran? Surely for American sanctions to be effective, the others still in the original agreement cannot act as sanction-busters?
Will companies that continue to trade with Iran be prevented from trading with the US? Given, too, that US banking dominates global trade, are there further possibilities that companies that continue trading will face financial isolation?
Quite apart from the military time bomb Trump’s action has planted in the affairs of the Middle East, clearly the implications of America becoming a sort of economic policeman to enforce Iranian sanctions furthers the potential for a global economic war.
And what now of the western alliance? Has this decision not created spectacular implications for the future of an alliance, which has linked Europe and America politically, militarily and economically for generations. What now and where now?
Despite personal pleadings and transatlantic hikes from the leaders of France and Germany, Trump remained adamant. Even the famous so-called special relationship with Britain counted for nothing.
Imagine, the closest that Britain’s foreign secretary Boris Johnson could get to Trump was to go on the president’s favourite Fox News programme and plead. What now of Britain’s post-Brexit prospects for new trade agreements with the US, if Britain continues to trade with Iran?
Trump’s abandoning of the western alliance has come as a bombshell. Potentially it opens up a whole new diplomatic world map and it creates a division across the Atlantic that hasn’t existed since before World War II. It also invidiously links the state of that relationship to events in the Middle East.
How long then before Iranians realise that the new US sanctions regime effectively traps the country back in economic purdah, and they start up the centrifuges again?
Will that in turn signal an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear sites in a US proxy war? Has not the most unstable part of the world now become the plaything of the US’s most unstable foreign policy direction in generations?
How come Israel, with an estimated arsenal of some 200 nuclear bombs, is so exercised about Iran which has no nuclear bombs at all?
This weekend, the papers are full of the news that in a few weeks’ time big rocket man heads to Singapore to meet little rocket man. It’s being sold as the solving of the world’s most dangerous crisis.
I was not sure that China would ever have allowed little Rocket Man throw all his toys out of the pram on the Korean peninsula. The grim prognosis this weekend is that the emerging Iranian crisis may potentially be far more dangerous and far more likely to lead to war than ever the nuclear crisis with North Korea was.

Highlight: What could the government have done differently last week? Here are five things to start with 
Body


Few issues of recent times have highlighted the responsive, rather than proactive, nature of our political system like the cervical smear controversy.
The government has tried to stay on top of the crisis with a number of announcements from an inquiry to a redress package to legislation to stop a repeat of what happened.
But this all glosses over the fact that they were in a position to put in place policies that could have prevented some of the damage caused to women that has emerged in recent weeks.
Here are five things politicians could have done:
1 Put in place an independent HSE board
The HSE is the biggest service offered by the state and the biggest employer in the country with a staff of 110,000 and a budget of €14 billion. Yet its governance structures are appallingly weak, mainly because of a government decision in 2011 to scrap its board. The health minister has long since acknowledged as much, telling an Oireachtas Committee on the future of healthcare in March 2017: “I do not believe the current governance structures are in any way adequate for me to discharge the functions the House expects me to discharge.”
The Sláintecare Report in May 2017 recommended that an independent board should be appointed “at the earliest possible opportunity” with the director general accountable to the board and the board accountable to the minister. A cabinet decision was made in October 2017 to reinstate an independent HSE board. This has still not happened.
If the proper governance arrangements had been in place, then senior managers would have had to answer for the decision not to tell cancer patients about their smear test history.
2 Legislated for mandatory open disclosure
The government has promised to bring forward laws to make full disclosure with patients mandatory. But it baulked at the chance to do just that back in 2016. In 2015, the then health minister, Leo Varadkar, initially said of such a duty of candour “I think it is just right.” The Oireachtas health committee also recommended making it law.
But both rowed back on that decision after the health department’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said it would lead to “a large bureaucratic overhead that distracts from patient care” and that open disclosure would best be achieved by “fostering the development of an open and honest culture”.
The decision to rely solely on his advice, which has not been made public, created a vacuum where there was no legal requirement to tell women about the misreading of their earlier test results.
3 Put in place a less adversarial approach in court proceedings involving patients
Varadkar told the Dáil last week that “nobody wants to see sick people or terminally ill women dragged through the courts. The public does not want that and it is in nobody’s interest. It is certainly not in the interests of the taxpayer in the longer run, of confidence in our health service or of patients or citizens”.
But had his government acted on a commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government published in May 2016, then women such as Vicky Phelan and nine others - including three who have since died - would not have been dragged through the courts.
The programme contains a commitment to take a less adversarial approach in medical negligence cases. It said the government would set up a working group to report back within six months “on options to reform the law of torts and the current claims process”.
The Taoiseach has asked the Attorney General to work with the State Claims Agency to examine the remaining cases with a view to settling them, or resolving them by way of mediation as soon as possible in order that they do not have to go to court. If he can do so with the remaining cases, then why could his government not have taken such an approach to Vicky Phelan’s case, which the Minister for Health was advised about three days before it went to court?
4 Brought into force existing laws to reduce patients’ trauma in court cases
In 2015, the Legal Services Regulation Act was signed into law. Part of that act was designed to prevent the trauma people experience taking on the state in clinical cases and provides for “pre-action protocols” or steps that can be taken before starting proceedings.
The Taoiseach explained last week that there is is “a legislative process which must be undergone. Often a law is enacted and it takes a couple of months, or even longer, for it to be commenced into law.” Three and a half years on, that section of the act has not yet been commenced, or enforced. Varadkar said this is because “the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which is the body that will deal with it, has only been established in the past few months”. Fianna Fáil does not buy that explanation and says it is inexcusable that this section of the act was not commenced.
5 Prepared better to keep women informed
Harris received a note from his officials on April 16 - days before Vicky Phelan’s case progressed to court, advising him of the details. It outlined how the screening was falsely reported as negative in 2011, that she did not find out about her cancer until 2014 and did not find out about the false negative until 2016. It said the State Claims Agency had advised the department that “publicity around the case and/or settlement is likely”.
It would appear that his officials fell far short of what was required of them in fully conveying to him the gravity of the issue. If it was their intention to alert him to the seriousness of what was about to unfold, he did not pick up on the signals.
Either way, the department was hopelessly under-prepared for the controversy. Women were advised to contact their GPs about repeat smears on the Tuesday before last, but an arrangement with GPs was not agreed until the following Friday. The helpline has also been struggling to cope, with 900 women contacting it on one day last week. Some 4,000 out of around 12,000 women who called it are awaiting a callback. Had the minister asked more questions or paid more heed to that memo, his government might have been better prepared and have mitigated some of the fear and confusion that was to come.

This line was often played by the late Vugar Gashimov, and Carlsen’s choice could be viewed as something of a tribute.

A novel way to treat the position, intending to put the bishop on b2 and castle queenside.
6 . . . e6 7.Bb2 a6 8.0–0–0 b5 9.f3 h5?!
Pushing the h-pawn delays White’s g4–advance, but also makes it easier for White to open files on the kingside.

A very strong move, but there was an excellent alternative. The thematic 17.Nd5! exd5 18.exd5 would regain the piece with a large advantage since, if the knight retreats with 18 . . . Nd8, White slowly builds a huge attack with 19.Qd3 Rh8 20.Bg4 Kf8 21.Rd2 Kg8 22.Rde2 Bf8 23.Re8 and Black can hardly move.

Black’s prospects have improved, but Carlsen continues to pose problems.
22.Ne2 Nxe2 23.Rxe2 Bc3 24.Bxc3 Qxc3 25.Qe3 Rc5?
25 . . . e5 would have limited White’s advantage.

Multimillionaire property developer and horse owner Luke Comer’s plans to build a thoroughbred operation to rival the giant Coolmore Stud have hit another planning hurdle.
An Bord Pleanála last week ruled that his plans for a gallops and a covered exercise track for his horses in Co Kildare were not exempted development and would require planning permission.
The plan involved the construction of an exercise track and gallops for horses at Palmerstown House. An inspector for An Bord Pleanála stated that “significant works in relation to the track have already been undertaken” including extensive filling, the raising of ground, drainage works and pipe installation, and the creation of a rough track covered in loose shale and stone.
According to An Bord Pleanála’s report, Comer had sought clarification from Kildare County Council on whether it was exempted development, and in 2017 the council ruled it was not. Comer then took his application to An Bord Pleanála, which last week agreed with the council.
Comer bought Palmerstown House in 2013 – formerly owned by the late Jim Mansfield – and it is just one part of the empire he operates with his brother Brian.
It hasn’t all been plain sailing, however, and last year Luke Comer received fines and costs of around €50,000 from the Turf Club on foot of a number of infringements at his stables.

The building materials giant CRH is to apply to the High Court to strike out or stay a legal action brought by developer Sean Mulryan’s Ballymore Group over the alleged supply of pyrite affected stone products in north Dublin.
Lawyers for the firm and its subsidiary Roadstone described the case as “horribly complex” in the High Court last week in circumstances where a number of separate claims for damages have been brought by homeowners against Ballymore, which constructed the residential estate of 145 houses.
From 2010, residents at Drumnigh Wood in Portmarnock began to complain of structural defects, alleged to be as a result of pyritic heave.
Ballymore initiated High Court proceedings against its suppliers two years ago. The case may be heard next year. Separately, Ballymore is the subject of two sets of proceedings taken by homeowners. The court heard one set is being handled by insurers Premier Guarantee while the other involves 30 to 40 homeowners. Four or five lead or pathway cases are due to be heard first.
Last Thursday, the CRH proceedings came before Justice Deirdre Murphy who heard Ballymore Residential had recently been invited by the defendants to discontinue the proceedings.
Ballymore is opposing the move with lawyers for the builders arguing in court that it was “inconceivable” to abandon the case after two years of litigation including a four-day contested application for the building firm to be allowed inspect and take samples from seven of CRH’s quarries.
Ballymore argued that given the overlap in the various actions in play it would be preferable to stay the claims brought by the homeowners until the CRH proceedings are determined.
In reply to this, barrister Paul Sreenan for CRH and Roadstone said Ballymore was looking for a global indemnity in respect of the claims against it. He said the current proceedings could not possibly decide claims by homeowners where indemnity would have to be dealt with on a house-by-house basis.
Responding to Justice Murphy’s query as to whether his clients might escape liability if their products were found to have been misused, counsel again said this would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. He added that his side was prejudiced by Ballymore failing to keep records about the sub-flooring of houses in the estate.
The court will hear the strike-out motion in the coming weeks.

Cross-border highway is planned to ease Brexit

Highlight: The new route will involve different sections being built on both sides of the border, due to close cooperation between local authorities in Donegal and Derry
Body


The government is going to build a cross-border dual carriageway from Dublin to the northwest to help counter the threat from Brexit.
The new route will involve different sections being built on both sides of the border, due to close cooperation between local authorities in Donegal and Derry.
There will be a 36km bypass of Ardee in Louth and a dual carriageway from Clontibret in Monaghan to Aughnacloy in Tyrone. This will connect to the new A5 dual carriageway through Tyrone, which will be co-funded by the Irish and British governments. There will also be a new bridge over the river Foyle at Lifford and Strabane as part of a new €200 million dual carriageway serving both Letterkenny and Derry city.
Government chief whip Joe McHugh said the upgrade of the northwest route would cut journey times and increase the prospect of attracting new investment.
“You are changing the whole Donegal story from one of forgottenness and isolation to one of opportunity. All of this is happening in the next six to seven years,” he said.
The journey time from Donegal and Derry to Dublin currently takes around three and a half hours in good traffic conditions. The new upgraded road should bring that down to under three hours.
There is a commitment to fund various sections of the route in the recent ten-year national development plan. But there is also significant work being done by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council to advance the project. They did a joint analysis after the Brexit referendum, which identified the upgrading of the road network to Dublin as a priority action to mitigate the impact of Brexit.
Derry City and Strabane District Council chief executive John Kelpie said the average speed of vehicles along the A5 section was 45mph (74kmh).
“That places businesses in Derry and Donegal at a disadvantage when accessing their largest potential market in the Dublin metropolitan region,” he said. “This disadvantage is likely to be compounded if there are any checks on the border and thus the completion of the upgrading of the Letterkenny-Derry-Dublin road link is more critical than ever in this new environment.”
Kelpie welcomed the Irish government’s commitment to support this project in the national development plan.
“We’re anxious that work on upgrading the road be started immediately in advance of the UK’s exit from the EU so that we ensure the best possible outcome for the region,” he said.

Cunningham: ‘I was intimidated to try to get me to drop case against the Gardaí, DPP and CAB’

Body


Ted Cunningham, the retired Cork-based financier, has said he believes there was a recent attempt to “intimidate” him in order to get him to withdraw a case he is taking against An Garda Siochana, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the DPP and Danske Bank.
Cunningham made this allegation last week, as part of proceedings in the High Court to compel the four defendants to explain where £3 million that was seized from him in the wake of the Northern Bank robbery has gone, and on what grounds it was taken.
Cunningham alleged in an affidavit opened in court before Mr Justice Seamus Noonan that on Monday, April 16, he was approached by a member of the Special Branch as he was looking for the bus from Heuston Station to Finnstown Castle in Lucan.
“The Garda detective showed me his identification and he explained to me that he was a Special Branch officer,” Cunningham said.
The detective, he said, told him he did not want to “embarrass” him by stopping him in the station and had waited instead for a “quiet place to stop and talk”. Cunningham claimed the detective then brought up the case he was taking.
“He told me: ‘We seem to be at loggerheads over the £3 million which was taken from your house.’” Cunningham said his solicitors KRW Law were dealing with this. He claims that the detective then said: “Surely, we can sit down and talk about it?”
Cunningham said he couldn’t, and the detective then said: “You must have had a terrible time while in prison” in relation to the Northern Bank robbery. Cunningham agreed he had.
The detective said he was too young to have been involved in the investigation that led to Cunningham’s imprisonment, and suggested again they should “sit down and resolve this”.
Cunningham said he was “shocked and traumatised” by the approach and said he believed it was an “attempt to intimidate in such a way that I might withdraw my case. I have no intention of doing so”.
Cunningham’s counsel asked the court last week for a direction asking the respondants to reply to the questions he had asked about what had happened to the £3 million seized from him. Counsel for Danske Bank and the DPP said they both planned to file affidavits, but that they wanted to wait for the Garda Commissioner and CAB to lodge their responding affidavits first.
Cunningham’s solicitors, KRW Law, have also written to Irish Rail seeking access to CCTV footage taken at Heuston Station at 12.25pm on April 16 when their client was allegedly approached by the other party. A complaint has also been made to Gsoc on the matter. A full hearing of Cunningham’s case is set for June 5.
Cunningham rose to prominence in the wake of the Northern Bank robbery when a gang stole £26.5 million in Belfast in December 2004, in what was one of the biggest thefts in British and Irish history. Nobody involved in the heist has ever been convicted, and the robbery was allegedly carried out by the IRA.
Cunningham has pleaded guilty to two counts of “being reckless” as to whether sterling cash taken from his home “represented the proceeds of criminal conduct, namely a robbery at the Northern Bank”. The amount of money involved was £100,040 and £175,360, a tiny fraction of the amount taken.
A sum of €2.9 million and €45,000 was, however, confiscated from him which has never been returned. Cunningham has written to CAB and Danske Bank, the new owner of the Northern Bank, in an attempt to determine this money’s location, but he has yet to discover where the £3 million is.
Cunningham is seeking an order to compel CAB to provide him with “a proper accounting (with supporting documents) in relation to the seizure, detention and distribution of over £3 million in cash belonging to me and taken from my home”.
He also claims that this money was seized pursuant to an “unconstitutional warrant”

Debutant novelist fully indulges her sentimental side

Highlight: Your humble reviewer found Helen Cullen’s The Lost Letters of William Woolf a pretty sentimental sort of book, and it wasn’t entirely to his taste. Which isn’t to say that it’s a bad book
Body


FICTION: The Lost Letters of William Woolf, By Helen Cullen, Michael Joseph, €14.95
It is, when you think about it, rather strange to accuse a novel of being “sentimental”. In its earliest usages, “sentimental” simply meant pertaining to physical and mental sensations – that is, to the stuff out of which all fiction is made. (In this sense, all novels are sentimental novels.) It was only in the late 18th century – when the Gothic novelists overdid “sentiment” in the hopes of generating cheap thrills – that the word took on its present meaning.
When we call a novel “sentimental” nowadays, we generally mean it as a term of abuse. It’s the cynic’s favourite move: to call a book sentimental is to dismiss it, superbly, from serious consideration. But ever since the heyday of the Gothic novel (with its hysterical heroes and its mercurial heroines, its portentous scenery and suspiciously well-timed thunderstorms), writers and critics of a less cynical cast of mind have been fighting a rearguard action in the name of sentimentality.
Back in 1979, John Irving defended Dickens against the charge that his characters were absurdly sentimental by suggesting that real people are absurdly sentimental, too. And Vladimir Nabokov once remarked that “people who denounce the sentimental are generally unaware of what sentiment is”. More recently, academic critics have pointed out that the tag “sentimental” has frequently been used to deny the power and appeal of fiction written by women.
All of which is an elaborate way of saying that your humble reviewer found Helen Cullen’s The Lost Letters of William Woolf a pretty sentimental sort of book, and that it wasn’t entirely to his taste. Which isn’t to say that it’s a bad book: it’s a solidly-crafted piece of commercial fiction with a high-concept hook and some well-realised characters. Its saccharine-ness (saccharinity?) is built in: it’s a story about searching for true love; a certain amount of sentimentality is inevitable.
Cullen’s protagonist, the eponymous Woolf, is stuck in an expiring marriage to his college girlfriend, Clare. William works in the Dead Letter Depot in East London. Here, undeliverable letters accumulate and must be sorted and, if possible, returned to their senders. Up on the fourth floor of the Depot repose the truly undeliverable letters: those addressed to “Supernaturals” (God, Santa, the Tooth Fairy). William dreams of publishing an anthology of these cries from the heart.
Rummaging through the undeliverables one day, William finds a letter addressed only to “My Great Love” and signed “Winter”. “Maybe this is the year you will find me,” the letter begins. “I hope so.” William hopes so too. He finds himself obsessed with Winter’s letters and their mysterious author. Will he follow the clues contained in her messages, and track her down? What will happen if he does?
The sentimentality of this conceit is, as I say, built-in. And Cullen’s prose is rather lush – tending at points towards the twee. “William watched as a shy smile illuminated her expression and her eyes grew misty.” “His ribcage expanded like the bellows of old.” “Her stomach was churning, doubling and dancing with the shame of his disrespect and her inability to walk away.” “The hours slipped away as they danced to each and every song the DJ played.”
The real problem with sentimentality in fiction is that it can lead the writer away from thought and towards reflex – and reflex, in fiction, usually means cliché. “A sickening dread crawled over his skin.” “She woke up to a sinking feeling.”
Cullen is an Irish writer living in London and The Lost Letters of William Woolf is her first novel. If it suffers occasionally from uneven pacing, it generally redeems itself with a charm and energy that embody the best aspects of sentimentality – a strong affection for its characters, and a warm sense of the vicissitudes of love.

Dermot Desmond, Gavin O’Reilly and the last days of the Sunday Tribune

Highlight: When a business article published in 2001 angered  one of Ireland’s richest men, he swore vengeance. The eventual ripple effect helped to bring about regime change at Ireland’s biggest newspaper group 
Body


The closure of the Sunday Tribune in 2011, after 31 years in business, set off a chain reaction that had long-running implications for its benefactor: Ireland’s biggest newspaper group, Independent News & Media. Within 18 months of its closure, INM had a new shareholder called Dermot Desmond, a multibillionaire who now finds himself as a potential kingmaker in embattled INM with a 15 per cent shareholding. During the same period, INM’s former chief executive Gavin O’Reilly left, ending the O’Reilly family’s influence on the company.
Desmond is not known for losing money. His decision to instal John Bateson, the managing director of his investment vehicle IIU, to the board of INM indicates his commitment to the company. But why did he ever get involved in such a high-profile company and what will Desmond do next? Today, we investigate the origins of his stakebuilding dating back to 2011.
On February 1, 2011, INM appointed a receiver to the Sunday Tribune on foot of debts of €30 million, money that showed no sign of ever being repaid. Twenty-two days later, the newspaper closed after the chronically loss-making title failed to find a buyer. Forty-three staff lost their jobs; a newspaper with a proud tradition of breaking stories and nurturing talented journalists was no more.
Its closure was not entirely unexpected. INM was struggling under a debt mountain that had forced it to sell off prize assets in India and South Africa, as well as offload the prestigious but loss-making Independent in London to a Russian oligarch for £1. Editor Nóirín Hegarty said the Tribune’s demise was “a very sad day for indigenous journalism”. It was, however, just the beginning of a remarkable investment saga for Desmond that still has some way to run.
Dermot Desmond was on the west coast of the US when he rang Gavin O’Reilly on his mobile phone on February 4, 2011, just three days after the Tribune closed. The multibillionaire was financially robust even in the midst of a terrible global recession that wiped out many others.
According to a note kept by O’Reilly of his conversation, Desmond expressed “annoyance” at INM’s decision to pull the plug on the Sunday Tribune. He was within weeks of beginning a court case against the Sunday Tribune and its former editor, Matt Cooper, over a business article written ten years earlier. Desmond was convinced that he had been libelled in this article, and he believed that the newspaper had “messed” him around by delaying his case for years.
Desmond said he wanted an apology and damages to be paid to charity. “I said that I was not overly familiar with the details of the case, but I said that if he went to court and for example, won, he’d become an unsecured creditor of the Tribune, as it was in receivership,” replied O’Reilly, according to the note. “I said that I would read myself into the matter and that I’d give him a call on Monday or Tuesday, explaining that I would be in South Africa.”
The following Thursday, on February 10, 2011, at 6pm South African time, O’Reilly rang Desmond back. He asked Vincent Crowley, INM’s chief operating officer, to witness the call.
It was 8am on the west coast when Desmond answered just as he was about to play a round of golf. O’Reilly said he had looked into the legal action and believed that the Sunday Tribune might have had a defence, but that this was “academic, considering the title was in receivership”.
“I said that I was piggy in the middle and was merely trying to find some sort of practical accommodation that gives him vindication,” O’Reilly said. “I said I had no responsibility in this, but if an accommodation could be found, I’d help sell it to the Tribune.”
Desmond said that the Sunday Tribune had offered him an apology only that week, but that he wanted not only that, but also his costs to be paid and damages to be paid to charity.

“He then said that he would be buying 15 to 20 per cent of INM and would then ‘find the person responsible’ and said that he had ‘already started buying (INM),” claimed O’Reilly.
Desmond did not respond to a request for comment on this phone call, or any other matter to do with the Sunday Tribune or INM. He is a respected investor and is under no obligation to respond to press queries.
O’Reilly, according to a file note later circulated to the board of INM, told Desmond that his case was nothing to do with INM, but the financier disagreed with him and insisted that the Sunday Tribune was effectively a “subsidiary of INM’s”.
This was not an uncommon view of the newspaper at the time. The Tribune was seen by many in the media industry as a hedge by INM against the encroachment of the Sunday Times in the Irish market.
Desmond warned O’Reilly that he was not going to walk away from his legal action, despite the plug being pulled on the Sunday Tribune.
O’Reilly emailed his notes to Crowley and finance director Donal Buggy.
“I concur with your record of your second conversation with Dermot Desmond as recorded below,” Crowley responded.
“In so far as I was present while the call took place, and can confirm that your record of your input into the conversation accords fully with my memory and understanding of what took place.”
O’Reilly had been warned and, as he was to later to discover, Desmond was not an investor to be trifled with.
On February 16, 2011, the Sunday Tribune and Matt Cooper apologised to Dermot Desmond in the High Court in relation to two articles published in 2001 and 2002. The case went to the wire before the decision was made to apologise, not just in relation to a Greencore article, but also for a second article about the Moriarty Tribunal.
Cooper agreed to pay €10,000 from his own pocket to charity as part of the settlement.
The first apology said: “An article appeared in the Sunday Tribune dated 11th February 2001 under the heading ‘Cahill falls on surprise sword’. In that article, it was stated that the board of Greencore and Bernie Cahill had been told that Dermot Desmond’s IIU, a 14.7 per cent shareholder in Greencore, had no objection to the change of the company’s articles to allow Mr Cahill to remain as chairman. It was further stated that Mr Cahill had been targeted by Mr Desmond. We recognise that these statements were inaccurate and should not have been published.”
The second apology stated: “An article appeared in the Sunday Tribune on 24th November 2002 under the heading ‘Indifference and defiance may turn to concern when Moriarty returns’.
“The article suggested that Dermot Desmond was an unfit person to participate in business transactions involving the state, and that he did not disclose his involvement as an investor in Esat Digifone.
“Matt Cooper and the Sunday Tribune accept that these suggestions were inaccurate and sincerely apologise to Mr Desmond.”
It was a clear victory for Desmond. But was it over? O’Reilly hoped it was.
He texted Desmond afterwards: “Glad a settlement and apology was finally arrived at: sense prevailed at S Tribune. Statement in court reads as proper vindication for you. Hopefully, our next call will be to set up dinner!! Best, Gavin.”
The following day, Desmond wrote to O’Reilly, making it clear that things were not over.
“We have had many conversations about Matt Cooper’s unsavoury articles as published by the Sunday Tribune,” Desmond wrote.
“While the Sunday Tribune has conveniently gone into receivership at your behest, as I have said to you on the phone, the Tribune is not off the hook and INM is 100 per cent liable for the damage caused by both these articles.
“You effectively call the shots at the Tribune. I am therefore not letting you avoid responsibility for these cases in circumstances where you pulled the plug on the Sunday Tribune.”
Desmond said “sheer obstinacy” by the Sunday Tribune had run up “unnecessary legal costs” and dragged on the case. “These cases should have been sorted out years ago. I will therefore be holding INM responsible for my legal costs.”
Desmond told O’Reilly that he would easily have won both libel actions. “You had no justification to prolong the litigation and were not amenable to sensible discussions to resolve the cases,” he wrote.
“I am therefore looking for damages in the amount of €500,000 or [managing director of the Sunday Tribune] Michael Roche’s salary for the last two years, whichever is the greater, which I will pay to a charity of my choosing.
“Believe me, this is not going to go away and I will not be folding my tent. I look forward to receiving your cheque.
Later that day, O’Reilly replied to Desmond on INM notepaper saying he was “hugely surprised” at Desmond’s position.
“I assure you there was nothing convenient or comforting for the board of INM in taking such a difficult decision (especially with regard to the potential impact on the 43 Sunday Tribune employees), and the decision was taken with due regard to what was best for INM and its shareholders, quite independent of, or cognisant of, any pending libel litigation.
“There is no basis for you asking that INM pay you for something that it is not responsible for; INM has no responsibilities for your legal costs, or indeed anything to do in relation to this matter.”
O’Reilly asked Desmond could they instead put the matter behind them as he had received a “fulsome apology”.
“That is where the matter ends. From your letter, I know what you want, but the shareholders of INM cannot accommodate your wishes.”
O’Reilly suggested a face-to-face meeting to resolve their differences.
On February 21, 2011, Desmond replied: “I have to say I am the one who is surprised by your letter. You cannot pass the buck on the decision to put the Sunday Tribune into receivership.
“You decided when it was going into receivership. It has been uneconomical since you invested, so the time was in your hands.
“I told you in our conversation that an apology was unacceptable and I would pursue the Independent by whatever means, which I will do.”
Desmond accused O’Reilly of being “disingenuous” by saying INM had no responsibility for the Tribune’s closure.
“You state that the apology was suitably covered in the press, without mentioning of course that the Irish Independent censored the story and gave it zero coverage. There is no point in meeting face to face unless you have a cheque.”
After receiving this letter, Gavin O’Reilly wrote a long note to his board on February 24, 2011, attaching all of his correspondence with Desmond in an appendix.
O’Reilly said he would “normally not bother” directors about libel issues, but felt he needed to, as Desmond had indicated he was going to “become a major shareholder in the company.”
He then described his various interactions with Desmond in the run-up to the apologies.
“So the matter is closed/settled,” O’Reilly continued. “While Mr Desmond may have wished that his costs were paid for by the Sunday Tribune, curiously, he chose not to pursue either Matt Cooper or the receiver for such costs.”
O’Reilly said the Tribune had not closed in order to avoid a legal action. “As we all know, nothing could be further from the truth; the issue of the Sunday Tribune has been a matter of repeated board deliberation for over 18 months, and the board’s final decision has to do with faltering circulations, escalating losses and major cash outflows,” he wrote. “Indeed, the matter of potential libel litigation was never considered – nor should it have been – by INM, as we had no hand, act or part in it.”
O’Reilly wrote that he had taken legal advice from the company’s lawyers, who told him that INM had no liability in relation to the Sunday Tribune: “Even if INM were somehow minded to make some sort of ‘goodwill’ offer (and personally I see no basis on which this would be defensible with our shareholders), it would set a very dangerous precedent for other libel actions that the Sunday Tribune may have from prior years, ie, other plaintiffs could seek to enjoin INM in any future litigation.
“That would clearly not be in the best interests of INM or its shareholders, essentially giving a blank cheque to others.”
O’Reilly asked his board to consider a letter that company secretary Andrew Donagher was considering sending Desmond formally, and for them to respond within 36 hours.
“It is very unfortunate that Mr Desmond has chosen this very aggressive (and remarkable) route against INM,” O’Reilly wrote.
Later that day, Paul Connolly responded to O’Reilly’s letter. Connolly was one of three directors who represented major INM shareholder Denis O’Brien on its board. The other two were radio boss Lucy Gaffney and corporate doctor Leslie Buckley.
Connolly said that “on the face of it” O’Reilly was right, but he feared INM was much closer to the Sunday Tribune than it should be.
The “sheer quantum” of loans advanced by INM to the Sunday Tribune meant, he said, “the dogs on the street knew that we effectively managed and controlled (it)”.
Connolly said he was worried, too, that INM appeared to be “steering” the receivership process.
“Likewise, a few weeks ago, INM became embroiled in the ‘masthead’ dispute with the Mail on Sunday – whatever about the rights or wrongs of what the Mail did, it wasn’t our dispute.”
This was a reference by Connolly to the decision by the publisher of the Irish Daily Mail to put out a Sunday newspaper that looked similar to the Tribune after it closed.
“In addition, as we know, journalists all over the world rarely write personal cheques to settle any libel case - did Matt Cooper really settle this on his own, or did INM underwrite it?” Connolly asked.
While Connolly might have been justified in posing such a question, Cooper did settle the case personally.
“Many of our other actions, such as those outlined above, could imply that we had a far higher degree of control thereby forming a basis for any aggrieved creditor to take a shot at INM,” Connolly concluded.
He said that, ultimately, he agreed that INM should send Desmond the Donagher letter.
Connolly, however, warned that the Donagher letter “may not be the end of the matter for INM from this or any other source making a Sunday Tribune claim on INM”.
On February 25, 2011, the Donagher letter was sent to Desmond. It said INM believed it had “no liability” to him in relation to the Sunday Tribune.
“As such, INM will – on behalf of its shareholders – strenuously defend any attempts by you to obtain monies from the company on this issue.”
Paul Connolly was right in his prediction that this might not be the end of the matter. Within three months, Desmond was reported to have amassed a 2 per cent stake in INM.
He had enough shares to send his representative John Bateson to speak at INM’s annual general meeting on June 3, 2011. This was a contentious meeting when, in a rare moment in Irish plc history, Leslie Buckley was voted off INM’s board by shareholders.
Bateson said at the agm that it would be a “grave” disappointment if Buckley left INM’s board, as he believed there had been a huge destruction in shareholder value prior to his appointment.
Afterwards, Buckley accused O’Reilly of “actively canvassing” for his removal, but O’Reilly denied this.
Investment advisory groups ISS and Glass Lewis did, however, produce reports in advance of the agm questioning Buckley’s independence, given his close links with O’Brien.
[caption id="attachment_416412" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Dermot Desmond refused to be pacified by Gavin O’Reilly’s efforts at rapprochement[/caption]
Elements within INM may have circulated these reports to institutional shareholders, but what was said or wasn’t said remains unclear.
Buckley’s ousting certainly stung him. In an interview with the Irish Times in April 2012, he admitted: “I was obviously very annoyed at the time, because I felt that in my period on the board, we had at least made some progress.” Buckley also spoke out about what he described as the “appalling” negative coverage of O’Brien in the Sunday Independent of April 1, 2011, when a series of articles appeared criticising the businessman.
“It’s very clearly part of a campaign against Denis O’Brien, right?” he alleged. “It could, of course, have something to do with the agm, but there is very clearly a campaign . . . against Denis O’Brien.”
“Do you think you’ll ever serve on the board of INM again?” Irish Times journalist Ciaran Hancock asked him.
“I haven’t really given it any thought, but I never say never,” Buckley replied.
By August 29, 2011, Desmond disclosed to the stock exchange that he had a 3.21 per cent stake in INM. The company’s share price was around 24 cent at this time, so he had spent a rough estimate of €5.5 million to build this position.
The following day, O’Reilly texted Desmond: “Dermot, hope you are well.”
O’Reilly said he was on an investor roadshow for INM. “Would be happy to meet you to discuss INM trading, forward strategy, etc. Would this be of interest to you or your colleagues? Thanks for letting me know, best Gavin O’Reilly.”
On September 15, O’Reilly again contacted Desmond. He wrote to the financier saying that he wanted to hear his views on INM as it strove to tell a better “equity story”, after shareholders had been decimated in the preceding years.
O’Reilly set out what he saw as the achievements of the company, from retaining profitability to paying down debt and meeting its banking covenants.
“I’d suggest there are very few – if any – major media companies in Ireland that are achieving what INM is in the current climate,” O’Reilly said. He added that if Desmond didn’t have time to meet, perhaps they could meet at the Global Irish Economic Forum, which both were scheduled to attend.
The forum was a think-tank set up for Irish business and political leaders to come up with solutions to steer the economy through the crisis. Desmond said he was travelling, but would like a “quiet moment” with O’Reilly at the event, which took place on October 8, 2011.
O’Reilly took a note of his encounter which he sent by email to INM executives Vincent Crowley, Karl Brophy and Donal Buggy, as well as to company solicitor Simon McAleese.
O’Reilly said he had met Desmond in the main courtyard of Dublin Castle while he was chatting to Michael Geoghegan, the former chief executive of HSBC. O’Reilly and Desmond moved away to talk to each other, and O’Reilly asked him would he like to meet up to discuss INM. Desmond replied he wasn’t interested.
According to O’Reilly, Desmond said he would spend “whatever it took” to get back his costs of €500,000 associated with the Sunday Tribune action, “even if it costs me millions”.
Desmond claimed, according to O’Reilly, that the Tribune was a subsidiary of INM. O’Reilly did not respond, but asked could the matter be put behind them.
Desmond said no, but said he had “great respect for your father”, in reference to Tony O’Reilly, who preceded Gavin as chief executive, and had led many different businesses including Heinz and Waterford Wedgwood. Desmond said he would do “whatever he had to, to get my revenge”, according to O’Reilly.
O’Reilly said this was unfortunate, as Desmond was now a shareholder in INM, a company he led. Desmond said he knew that, and the conversation ended.
On January 5, 2012, Desmond’s investment company IIU increased its stake in INM from 3.87 per cent to 4.24 per cent, at an estimated cost of €1 million.
On April 19 of that year, Gavin O’Reilly resigned from Independent News & Media, where he had worked since February 1993. INM’s share price was in the doldrums and the business required restructuring, making O’Reilly’s exit not entirely unexpected.
Later, it would emerge that Paul Connolly, the non-executive director of the company and representative of O’Brien, tried to sue the media group in an attempt to block O’Reilly’s €1.87 million exit package.
On June 6, Desmond increased his stake from 5.75 per cent to 6.36 per cent. Based on INM’s share prices at the time, this might have cost him another €3 million.
On April 26, 2013, INM announced it had agreed a restructuring with its syndicate of eight lenders.
The restructuring followed an announcement by the company that it was going to sell its South African business.
INM said it planned to raise new equity to enable €40 million of debt to be repaid, which would allow core debt levels to be reduced further to €118 million.
This new equity, it would emerge, was raised from Desmond and O’Brien who, following the restructuring, had 15 per cent and 29 per cent of the company respectively. Desmond is estimated to have invested another €15 million in the business.
In August 2012, at an egm, Leslie Buckley was appointed chairman of the company.
Jerome Kennedy, a former managing partner of KPMG, technology guru Triona Mullane and Len O’Hagan, a former Fitzwilton and Jefferson Smurfit Group executive, also joined the board.
Buckley’s tenure as chairman would turn out to be controversial, and he resigned from the company earlier this year. Within a short period, it emerged that INM was under investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Desmond, as a 15 per cent stakeholder in the company, has now invested an estimated €25 million at an estimated average of 12 cent a share.
INM has a strong underlying business, despite its recent trading last week at 9 cent a share. But can it beat the ODCE? Or will it find itself embroiled for years in investigations?
For Desmond, and other patient shareholders, the INM saga is far from over. What began for the financier with the Sunday Tribune has some way yet to run. Few, however, would bet against Desmond.

Highlight: Scandinavian furniture is dominant and influential at the de Veres design auction later this month 
Body


The first person to use the word ‘comfort’ in the modern sense was 18th-century innovator Horace Walpole. Until then, the word meant aid given to someone in distress, and was never applied to home furnishings.
Comfort was the masterstroke of 20th-century Scandinavian designers. They made furniture that delights the eye – and comforts the human frame. Typical is the Falcon chair, a global best-seller that spawned many a copycat version, created in 1970 by Norwegian designer Sigurd Resell (1920-2010) and features at the de Veres Design Auction on May 22 at the Royal College of Physicians. With its brown leather sling seats on bentwood bases, it is pleasingly reminiscent of a hammock (€1,000-€1,500).
Sitting comfortably in leather also sums up a Roche Bobois sofa that goes the extra mile with an adjustable headrest (€1,000-€1,500). Founded by Jacques Roche in 1950, the Paris firm specialises in contemporary furniture inspired by the Bauhaus designers.
In addition to 20th-century modern, the sale also includes a number of late 20th/early 21st-century classics. A headline lot is Figure of 6, a cutting-edge take on the bentwood chair by Joseph Walsh whose imagination elevates carpentry into the realms of fantasy. In pale ash, it stands 99cm high (€6,000-€9,000).
From 1990 there’s Philippe Starck’s WW stool in cast aluminium (€500-€700). More sculpture than stool, it was designed for film director Wim Wenders.
The most outré ceramic is Fruit Plate, by Danish ceramicist Bodil Manz whose work can be found in MoMA and the V&A. Manz made her name with paper-thin, translucent eggshell porcelain cylinders. In recent years, her work has gone in a different direction – with this piece she has some fun, 70×50×62cm (€2,000-€3,000).
Best described as objets d’art are three of Emmett Kane’s ebonised Irish burr oak Crocks, notably Crock of Gold (€1,000-€1,500)
Lighting highlights include the Ruray desk light designed in 2012 by Shane Holland (€200-€300), and, for Patrick O’Reilly aficionados, a bronze table lamp comprising a single bare bulb suspended on a long pole carried by a Marching Bear (€600-€900).
The top painting is Gold Painting 12/91, one of several lots by Patrick Scott, 129.5×129.5cm (€10,000-€15,000).
There are also five geometric abstracts by Theo McNabb, master of the cool palette, each with an estimate of €800-€1,200.

E-cigarette firm says HSE should promote vaping as way to quit

Highlight: A Public Health England e-cigarette evidence review published in February found that vaping poses only a small fraction of the risks of smoking, and that switching completely from smoking to vaping conveys substantial health benefits
Body


The owner of one of Ireland’s biggest e-cigarette companies has called on the HSE and the Irish Cancer Society to advocate vaping as a way to quit smoking like similar services do in Britain.
“The HSE should look at what the NHS is doing. Cancer UK, the NHS, the stop smoking services in the UK - we are light years behind,” Joe Dunne, who owns VIP Electronic Cigarette, said.
A Public Health England e-cigarette evidence review published in February found that vaping poses only a small fraction of the risks of smoking, and that switching completely from smoking to vaping conveys substantial health benefits.
It said that e-cigarettes could be contributing to at least 20,000 successful new quits per year and possibly many more and the evidence does not support the concern that e-cigarettes are a route into smoking among young people.
Dunne said that while the NHS advocates vaping as a way to quit smoking, even including it in advertisements, the services here will not do the same.
“The word that keeps coming back from the HSE, the Irish Cancer Society and the government is that we don’t know the long-term effects of vaping. It’s full stop after that,” he said.
“We don’t know the long-term effects of vaping. I agree with that comment. But that’s not the context it needs to be in. We’re not asking non-smokers to vape. The question is what is the difference between vaping and smoking and Public Health England says it is at least 95 per cent less harmful.”
Dunne said he would be happy to supply products for a trial in a stop smoking group in Ireland.
While vaping is not advocated by the HSE and Irish Cancer Society, demand is high. Dunne has 25 stores across the country, which includes two franchises, and he plans to open four more this year, two of which will be in Dublin.
The HSE said that current government policy notes the evidence regarding the safety of e-cigarettes and their effectiveness as a smoking cessation tool is insufficient.
“There are a range of policy and legislative issues regarding e-cigarettes and health to be considered by the Department of Health, high among them being regulation and pricing policy.”
The Irish Cancer Society said that while it acknowledges that e-cigarettes are less harmful than tobacco, it could not recommend them as a smoking cessation aid until further evidence on the long-term risks becomes available.

Evidence proves that cervical screening works

Highlight: No matter how good a screening programme, no matter how effective it is in reducing mortality in society, it will hurt some patients 
Body


The recent tragic cases of cervical cancer in women who had previously received falsely reassuring screening tests, should necessitate thoughtful scrutiny and analysis of our cancer screening programmes. Some of the political and journalistic commentary to date has fallen short of this standard.
Medicine has developed variably successful strategies for dealing with the cancer problem. Some cancers, such as childhood leukaemia, can be cured with drugs. For others, prevention is best. Lung cancer (usually, not always, caused by smoking) and cervix cancer (HPV vaccination).
For most cancers, the best chance depends on early diagnosis and treatment. For example, patients are encouraged to present promptly if they notice a breast lump, or bleeding from the back passage. Most will be found not to have breast or rectal cancers, but others will, and prompt attention can result in cure.
Screening is the ultimate early diagnosis strategy. “Screening” refers to testing apparently healthy people who have no complaints or symptoms, in an attempt to diagnose as yet occult cancers or pre-cancerous conditions. Patients may ask for screening or have doctors who recommend it (“opportunistic screening”). Alternatively, screening may be formally organised on a national or regional basis, usually by a government, which invites you to attend for a test that you have not sought.
Organised screening is nearly unique in healthcare. The patient doesn’t seek medicine, medicine seeks the patient.
The success of a screening programme is measured by the reduction it produces in the burden of the disease in society. On a population level, mammography (breast X-ray) screening is one of the most effective strategies available to society for reducing the death rate from breast cancer. A screened population of over 50-year-olds will have an approximately 20 per cent reduction in the number of breast cancer deaths compared to a similar group without screening.
The evidence that cervical screening works is overwhelming. Routine screening by studying cells from the cervix, entered the medical culture in most western countries during the 1970s. Since then the number of cervix cancer deaths has plummeted, dropping by one half in many jurisdictions. Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of death in women world-wide, mostly in poorer countries.
While it is hoped that cancer screening will help every individual being screened, it is obvious that it cannot. Why? The vast majority of a screened population don’t have cancer. Their negative (that is, normal) test is a “true negative”. Though they derive reassurance, their health is not improved at all.
No matter how good a screening programme, no matter how effective it is in reducing mortality in society, it will hurt some patients. “False positives” (when the test suggests the possibility of cancer, or cannot exclude cancer in, a cancer-free person) are relatively common. False-positives can terrify healthy patients who require further tests (sometimes including minor surgery) to prove that a screened abnormality was in fact harmless.
Some cancers and pre-cancers will not show up in screening tests, ie “false negatives”. False-negatives hurt patients. In addition to failing to diagnose the cancer at an earlier more curable stage, false negatives can lull a patient into a false sense of security, if they subsequently develop potentially serious symptoms.
False negatives are part of every screening test used in cancer. For example, 10 per cent of breast cancers simply don’t show on mammography, no matter how good it is and no matter how expertly it is performed.
False negatives may also be due to human error.
Organised screening services audit “interval cancers”. These are cancers which are diagnosed between screening tests, to see if the earlier screen should have picked them up, or if they were unavoidable. Relevant to the current Irish controversy, international studies of cervix screening suggest that there are approximately 50 false-negatives per 100,000 negative screen tests, and that about half of those 50 may be contributed to by human error.
Patients may suffer other harms. The “PSA” blood test is quite good at identifying prostate cancers in men, but it isn’t absolutely certain that treating these cancers with life changing surgery or radiotherapy prolongs survival, although many experts believe that it does.
Tragically, we still have approximately 100 cervix cancer deaths annually in Ireland (compared to approximately 700 deaths from each of breast and lung cancer). Newer generation cervix screening technologies and widespread vaccination will hopefully reduce the number further.
We should aim for zero.
The failure to disclose the information to cancer patients about their previous misdiagnoses was wrong, and added to the heartbreak of women who had already received the worst news of their life. The recently revealed HSE/DoH memoranda make a charge of legally-informed heartlessness difficult to defend. It should be noted, however, that the NHS in Britain, which has been cancer-screening for decades, first specified a duty of candour with respect to screening errors in 2016.
The evidence to date does not suggest that this failure to disclose prior mistakes contributed to delayed diagnosis, as has been irresponsibly suggested. The authorities only reviewed the screening history which revealed the errant screens after a diagnosis of cancer was made.
The misdiagnosis cases are troubling and are catastrophic in their impact on the patients and families in question. They should prompt two crucial, easily answered questions.
1) Is our rate of false negative screens higher than in comparable countries?
2) Is there a discrepancy in the “pick-up” rate between the different Irish and international labs that service CervicalCheck?

Ex-Sports Campus boss fails in redundancy claim

Body


The former boss of the National Sports Campus has failed to prove he was made redundant in October 2015, the Workplace Relations Commission has ruled.
David Conway, who served for a year and a half as acting chief executive of the National Sports Campus, claimed he was owed redundancy pay dating back to his time as acting chief executive.
Conway’s time as acting chief executive ended in October 2015 when the Sports Campus and the Sports Council were merged into Sport Ireland and John Treacy was appointed as chief executive of the new body.
Conway – who continued to work at Sport Ireland for nearly two years as sports campus director – also claimed that he was constructively dismissed in May 2017, a claim that was withdrawn at the hearing.
Conway, who is currently the chief executive of the Limerick Twenty-Thirty regeneration company, had worked at the National Sports Campus since 2003 and was appointed acting chief executive in April 2013, which saw his salary bumped up to €96,726 per annum.
As part of that, it was agreed that he would, on the appointment of a new chief executive, revert to his previous salary and duties.
However, after his spell as acting chief executive had ended his previous role no longer existed, so in October 2015 he was appointed as campus director on a salary of €83,506.
Conway filed a grievance with Sport Ireland in relation to the drop in salary, and the WRC noted that there was an exchange of emails in relation to the dispute between October 2015 and October 2016.

Body


What began life as a stone-clad schoolhouse in 1861 and remained so until 1970 has since become a lesson in transmutation: extended, remodelled, renamed and transformed into a well-presented five-bedroom family residence, spanning some 370 square metres nestled on two acres.
Currently on the market with Lisney and guiding €1.75 million, Victoria Lodge on Ballycorus Road in Kilternan in Dublin 18 has all the trappings of bucolic life, yet lies within minutes of Kilternan village, some 25 minutes from the city centre (off peak) and within five to ten minutes’ drive from both Carrickmines Park and Dundrum Town Centre.
Set behind granite walls and accessed via electric gates, the front gravel drive offers parking for multiple cars in front of the property’s double-door entrance set within the original cut stone façade.
Once inside, the large L-shaped entrance hall is laid in marble floor tiles and boasts a sandstone fireplace, which houses a wood-burning stove.
Double doors to the right lead into a triple-aspect drawing room, with a bespoke Artefaction fireplace set around a remote-controlled gas stove. The room boasts high ceilings with recessed lights, cream carpets, covered radiators and pale olive walls.
There’s a guest WC with marble floors off the entrance hall and a gallery hall to the left of the entrance, with a solid white oak staircase leading to the master suite on the first floor.
Further along the inner hall is an open-plan study area overlooking the front garden and fitted with bespoke walnut bookshelves and base-level cupboards in French white.
A second set of double doors from the main entrance hall open to a large kitchen/breakfast room fitted with hand-painted, soft-white base and wall-mounted units with pale granite worktops and upstands. A matching feature island and breakfast bar sits beneath the pitched roof which has six roof lights that flood the space with natural light.
A gourmand’s dream, the space has a stainless steel Brittania chef’s range with eight gas rings, double ovens and a chargrill plate. There’s also a Franke double sink, American double fridge/freezer, microwave/oven, coffee machine, two warming drawers/proving presses, two Fisher Paykel dishwashers and a CCTV monitor with four cameras, an audio/video intercom and a remote electric gate control/hold switch.
Delineating the kitchen from the open-plan living/dining room is the change from marble floor tiles to polished walnut floors which marry well with the room’s 16-foot vaulted ceilings and wall of full-height windows and two sets of double doors leading to the gardens. A wood-burning corner stove completes the space.
A plumbed utility room with additional fitted units and marble floors and a bespoke wine room with a handy multi-temperature fridge and walnut wine store complete this half of the ground floor accommodation.
[caption id="attachment_416246" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] The front of the house[/caption]
There are four double bedrooms, two of which are en suite, along this inner hall wing, which sits perpendicular to the front entrance. Two of the rooms with en suites have built-in wardrobes, while the third bedroom has a walk-in wardrobe area and double doors that open to the rear patio and garden.
The fully marble and stone tiled family bathroom has a free-standing double bath with floor-mounted chrome bath taps and a separate power shower.
The spacious master suite on the first floor features dual balconies to enjoy all-day sunlight. It has cream carpets and walls, built-in wardrobes opening to a dressing area and an en suite bathroom with marble floor tiles with underfloor heating, dual-wash hand basins, a power shower and a bath with mountain views.
Outside, the wraparound grounds have been professionally landscaped and include formal courtyard gardens to the front and informal lawned grounds at the rear designed by award-winning designer Eoin Ryan, lead designer at Inspire Gardens.
The planting includes box hedging, privets, bay trees, red robins, a water feature, laurel hedging, tree ferns, stipe grasses, ornamental grasses, cypress trees and more than 100 mature specimen trees throughout the grounds, including a forest of trees close to the second entrance. There is also a large sandstone terrace at the rear of the house. There is ample space to install paddocks if required, which would benefit from the property’s second entrance off Mine Hill Lane.
The area is home to a choice of primary and secondary schools. There are three bus routes in Kilternan servicing the city centre and surrounding areas. Golf and tennis facilities and numerous restaurants and bars are also nearby. Sandyford business district is a ten-minute drive away, and the nearest Luas and M50 exit are a five-minute drive from the house.
Viewing is by appointment with the agent at 01-2963662.

Fear and navel-gazing on the campaign trail

NON-FICTION: Chasing Hillary, By Amy Chozick, William Collins, €25
Bernie Sanders told Hillary Clinton during one of their primary debates that the American people were sick of hearing about her “damn emails”. Two years on, I’d venture that the American people are sick of hearing about her damn presidential campaign.
Despite the Sanders insurgency, the Clinton campaign had few white-knuckle moments. She won the primary as expected. Even the ugly battle with Trump seemed like a grim death march to victory for her. There was little doubt she’d win. Until she lost.
Amy Chozick, one of the many New York Times reporters covering the Clinton campaign, had her work cut out in finding a unique selling point. So, instead of writing about Clinton, Chozick turns the focus of the book on herself. And in doing so, she ignores a basic rule of journalism at her peril.
Katy Tur, the MSNBC journalist who was part of the NBC team covering Trump, published a book last year, the aptly titled Unbelievable. Her job was easier than Chozick’s: the chaotic, seat-of-the-pants Trump campaign makes for a more rollicking read than the cautious, by-the-numbers Clinton one.
But even allowing for that, her book is far more insightful and significantly less self-obsessed. While Tur provides a wry insight into the additional “pain in the ass” of covering a campaign as a female TV reporter, she cites a veteran reporter who reminds her that “no one cares” how tired or fed up or sick a journalist may be. ‘The news is not about you,” he says.
Someone should have given Chozick the same advice. Chasing Hillary tells us far more about her than Clinton. And frankly, it’s hard to care all that much about her myriad insecurities, her constant fretting over whether Clinton likes her or not, her craving for her editor’s approval and her post-election anguish over whether she devoted too much time to covering the hacked Clinton campaign emails.
In a frank assessment of the New York Times’s obsession with reporting every detail of their mundane contents, she writes: “I can’t explain it exactly, except to compare it to a fever that spread through every newsroom and made us all salivate over the tiniest morsels.”
The priority that editors accorded to the emails storyline didn’t just make the Times an unconscious adjunct to alleged Russian meddling in the US election. It ensured that journalists competing for a front-page byline endlessly chased that story instead of more newsworthy topics. In Chozick’s world, the instant gratification of a page one byline is depicted as the ultimate goal of a Times reporter. Context appears significantly less important. “I chose the byline. I always chose the byline,” she writes.
A number of Chozick’s colleagues at the Times are less than pleased by her book. Not just because she paints the paper (unwittingly, perhaps) as staffed by lemmings who chased the same story without examining its importance, but because she tells tales out of school. She cites one editor who thought the Trump campaign should be covered by the TV section.
Chozick’s tale-telling, her gushing praise for some of her colleagues and her navel-gazing are all wearying. It’s also curious that when critiquing (deservedly) the Clinton campaign team, she chooses to identify all the women while protecting the anonymity of male staffers, identifying them as Brown Loafer Guy, Original Guy, or Hired Gun Guy. This is something of an inside joke. This reporter spent a substantial amount of time on both the Clinton and Trump campaigns, and reporters shared nicknames for certain staffers who inspired strong feelings. But if the purpose of your book is to share your ringside seat with the readers, why shut them out with schoolgirlish pseudonyms?
Her coverage of the Clinton family dynamic is disappointing. She accurately describes Bill Clinton’s frustration as he tried and failed to drum into the campaign chiefs that they were ceding the white working-class vote to Trump by neglecting to visit states like Michigan: “Bill went red in the face on almost daily conference calls trying to warn Brooklyn that Trump had a shrewd understanding of the angst that so many voters – his voters, the white working-class whom Clinton brought back to the Democratic Party in 1992 – were feeling.”
The young turks ignored his advice, and the folly of their decision to shunt him aside as a relic of a bygone era became apparent when Clinton lost the previously Democrat states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
Any reporter who has covered a campaign trail knows it’s an endless round of rubber-chicken fundraisers, stale jokes, never-ending grip-and-grins, and hearing the same stump speech in school halls and arenas, until you could recite it in your sleep. Not that there’s much of that; covering a campaign means you fight perennial jetlag sleep with a diet of fast food and caffeine. It can bring new meaning to the word tedium, but it can also be thrilling and enormous fun. No one forces a reporter to do it. Chozick’s whining about the travails of being a campaign reporter can be grating.
Clinton’s defeat, and the factors that contributed to it, have been pored over exhaustively. The post-mortem has gone on for an indecently long period. It’s time to stuff the entrails back into the cadaver of her campaign, sew it up and bury it in an unmarked grave.

He received a call from the HSE last Tuesday week when he was informed his wife had been given two inaccurate smear test results – one in 2010 and another in 2013.
RTÉ aired an interview with Emma Mhic Mhathúna on Thursday morning. She was told in 2013 that her smear test was clear, but it wasn’t. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016. Last week, she was told that her cancer is terminal.
“If my smear test was right in 2013, I wouldn’t be where I am today. That’s what makes it so heartbreaking. I’m dying while I don’t need to die,” she said.
These individual tragedies followed the high-profile case of Vicky Phelan, whose decision to refuse to sign a confidentiality agreement with the US lab which misread her screen test triggered the current cervical cancer crisis.
Given that at least 209 women were provided with inaccurate smear results, more tragic stories are likely to come to public attention in the coming days and weeks.
On Thursday, Tony O’Brien, director-general of the HSE, appeared before the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee.
Damaging memos surfaced during the afternoon session. For many, it beggared belief that the HSE and the Department of Health were only now admitting they had received extensive briefing notes on the controversial issue, that had been enraging the public, as far back as 2016.
Previous claims that they knew nothing about the Vicky Phelan case began to look Jesuitical. Why the continued suppression of information?
The government began to worry it was not being told the full story of this omnishambles.
Pressure mounted.
By Thursday evening, Tony O’Brien, director general of the HSE, had stepped down, bringing the total number of resignations this crisis has elicited to three.
***
The memos that were eventually made available by the HSE on Thursday were described as “devastating”, “damning” and “smoking guns” by commentators.
Members of the Public Accounts Committee said they suggested that a strategy of containment and suppression of information was at play in 2016 when the health service was deciding what to do with review information of women’s cervical screen tests.
There were three iterations of this memo, which was circulated on behalf of the HSE’s national director of health and wellbeing, Dr Stephanie O’Keeffe.
The first provided a detailed explanation around the clinical audit process. It was initiated to identify how the screening programme could be improved. While it was not a “mandatory requirement”, management and clinicians involved decided to press ahead.
“It can provide information to women about why their cancers were not prevented and information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening,” it stated.
Members of the Public Accounts Committee seized on three elements: the memo’s reference to the need to manage adverse media reaction after women were told about their inaccurate smear test result.
At the end of the first of the three memos, there was advice on the “next steps” that stated:
There was a strong emphasis on upholding public confidence in the benefits of the overall screening programme. There was no reference to the women themselves, or how they might feel.
The memo advised that the volume of letters due to be dispatched “increased the risk of an individual reacting to the content if/when shared by their attending clinician”, Regina Doherty, Minister for Social Protection, described aspects of the memo as “disgusting”.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio, Doherty said it was “very obvious” to her that those behind the memo had no concern for the 209 misdiagnosed women. Many concluded that the memo itself showed the health service was deliberately – and at senior level – stifling open disclosure to patients.
The fact that the memo stated that one of the cytology laboratory providers had sought legal advice into the right of the screening programme to communicate audit outcomes received little attention.
“The programme is liaising with the legal team on this. This is not an impediment to moving forward with formal communication of audit outcomes,” it stated. “The legals were not about or against patients, but concerning the lab’s contract. It has to be done right so that the indemnity was available for any patient who might subsequently need it,” said one source who received the memo at the time.
The memo said 56 letters had been issued and that a further 200 letters would issue in July/August.
Another part of the memo also raised concerns: “There is always the risk that in communicating individual case reports to clinicians of an individual patient reacting by contacting the media if they feel that ‘screening did not diagnose my cancer’. This is a risk inherent in having a clinical audit process as part of the national programme . . . The volume element of letters increases the risk of an individual reacting to the content if/when shared by their attending clinician.”
What was the word ‘if’ doing in there given the pronouncements from various health ministers that the HSE was embracing a policy of open disclosure, where patients are told about adverse incidents that affected their health?
***
On Friday, the government announced the approval of financial assistance for the 209 women, whose initial cervical screen tests failed to detect abnormalities.
At a press conference held in government buildings, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said all outstanding legal actions would be “dealt with sensitively using mediation where possible”.
During the week, it emerged that a further nine women were taking legal actions over inaccurate smear test results.
These are separate to the case of Vicky Phelan, who settled her High Court case with a laboratory in the United States for €2.5 million last month.
An international expert panel, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the British Society for Coloscopy and Cervical Pathology, will review the results of screening tests of all women who have developed cervical cancer over the past ten years.
Dr Gabriel Scally has been appointed to investigate what went wrong in the CervicalCheck debacle. Scally is president of the Epidemiology and Public Health section of the Royal Society of Medicine in Britain.
A redress scheme has been promised. A Commission of Investigation is likely.
We are now more than two weeks into this crisis, yet the health service and the government are still unable to provide real reassurance around the quality of the laboratories we were, and are using, overseas.
This is key. There were warnings about the decision to outsource cervical screen testing back in 2008. The strong suggestion was that we had sacrificed standards and quality for money.
The state’s chief medical officer – and others – have sought to reassure the public that there was no problem with the quality of the screening programme itself and that all of the labs used are accredited and must operate to stringent standards.
We do not, however, know the error rate at the different labs.
Late last week, the Taoiseach sought to distinguish between negligent mistakes and unavoidable mistakes. Some will occur because of the limitations of screening itself, while others will occur because of human negligence.
An article in the prestigious Lancet journal also highlighted “a crucial distinction between unavoidable false-negative smears, which are an innate part of the programme, and ones that result from negligent practice. This distinction is further complicated by lawyers who propagate the mistaken belief that cervical screening has a zero error standard and that any error is therefore negligence”.
At this point we do not know how many of the 209 false-negative cases resulted from negligent practice. The scoping inquiry being led by Dr Gabriel Scally will attempt to establish these facts.
We also do not know exactly why doctors themselves did not tell their own patients about previous screening errors.
The guidelines that were eventually produced by CervicalCheck were loose and left some of the decisions up to treating clinicians.
Various theories have been posited, but again we do not actually have the answer.
Last week, the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan outlined cervical screening practice in other countries. “A survey of EU and EFTA countries published in the European Journal of Cancer described programme organisation, quality assurance (QA), monitoring and evaluation of cervical screening programmes.
“Twenty-nine countries responded and the results showed that organised efforts for QA, monitoring and evaluation were carried out to a differing extent and were not standardised across countries. Nineteen, including Ireland, implement national population-based screening,” Holohan said.
“Although cervical cancer case audits are a recommended aspect of programme evaluation and monitoring, audit activities only occur in 12 programmes, including Ireland. Seven of these, including Ireland, use the audit findings, mostly for programme improvement, lab QA, and education and training. Disclosure of clinical audit findings does not appear to be a prominent practice in cervical screening programmes internationally. In a rapid review of international literature, England was the only country where a clear published policy position in this regard was found. However, recent evidence of less than optimal implementation of this disclosure policy was apparent,” he said.
In other words, Britain appears to be the only European country that does actually have a clear published policy around telling patients – and even then it is not very well adhered to.
Doctors in Ireland were, quite clearly, far from alone in failing to tell their patients about mistakes in their screening history. Interestingly, studies from Britain show that when women were asked whether they wanted to find out about a review of their previous scan, about 40 per cent declined.
The difference in Ireland, of course, is that most were not given that choice.
***
Officials from the Department of Health and the HSE were hauled before various committees in the Dáil last week to explain what had led to the current debacle.
Politicians lamented the failure to disclose information while actively perpetuating misleading information themselves.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said “women’s lives were put in jeopardy by the HSE withholding information on false negative smears”. To many, this implied that doctors had deliberately delayed diagnosing and treating women with cervical cancer.
“This is simply untrue. Please stop scaremongering. The audit commenced after the cancers were diagnosed. No diagnosis was withheld. No treatment was withheld,” consultant obstetrician Dr Noirin Russell replied, in a message directed to McDonald.
“The diagnosis was already known when the audit commenced. That is why it was called a look back,” wrote Dr Cliona Murphy, incoming chair of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
McDonald appeared immune to the medical facts. In another missive, she stated that withholding the results of reviews, which were only initiated after the women concerned had started treatment, might have had a material affect on the treatment provided.
Obviously earlier intervention at the time of the initial false negative smear could have changed the outcome in some women, but all medical experts contacted categorically rejected McDonald’s claim.
“Management depends on the stage (how far advanced) the disease is at diagnosis,” said Michael Quinn, a world-renowned expert and president of the International Gynaecologic Cancer Society. “It is clear that early disclosure would not have altered the management.”
Dr Robert O’Connor, head of research with the Irish Cancer Society Society, said diagnostic scans and procedures were used to identify the extent and stage of the cancer. “Since treatment will follow accepted international practice for the diagnosis made, previous screening history will have no impact on that treatment as screening findings are not diagnostic,” O’Connor said.
One week earlier, Sinn Féin health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly had stated: “The state knew that women had cancer and didn’t tell them . . . how paternalistic, patronising and disgusting that is.”
Once again, this was inaccurate. O’Reilly subsequently deleted her comment on social media.
But Sinn Féin was not alone. Far from it. Inaccuracies seemed to transcend party boundaries. This has fuelled a certain level of public panic.
Consultant gynaecological oncologist Professor Donal Brennan responded to some of the heated exchanges in the Dáil and on the airwaves by saying that politicians needed “to move away from emotional scaremongering”.
Brennan said that “a constructive opposition should work towards constructive solutions”. He encouraged politicians to implement primary HPV screening, which is more accurate at detecting cervical abnormalities than the current smear test. He said politicians needed to introduce a gender-neutral vaccination against HPV and fund a programme for mandatory open disclosure.
That doctors/the HSE knew women had cervical cancer, but failed to tell them
False
Reviews of the smear history of women were initiated after they were diagnosed with cervical cancer. It was only then that CervicalCheck (the national screening programme) became aware that some women (we now know that there were at least 209) had received false negative tests.
That doctors and the HSE kept information relating to these false negative tests from women
True
Most of the women affected were not informed.
That the failure to tell women who had already received a cancer diagnosis about their previous screening history had a material effect on their treatment
False
The initial false negative result certainly did result in delays in diagnosing women with cervical cancer. This in turn led to delays in initiating treatment. Those delays were fatal for some women. However, screening history plays no part whatsoever in determining the type of treatment a woman with cervical cancer should receive. Informing the women, or their doctors, about previous false negative results would not have had any impact on the way in which doctors decided to treat the cancer. Many have, however, been outraged at the failure to disclose the information to the women affected.
That the decision to outsource many smear tests to the US or the private sector from 2008 onwards was the wrong decision
Unclear
There was extensive criticism of this at the time. The HSE has claimed those criticisms were comprehensively addressed. As yet, we do not know whether some labs were providing more accurate results than others. This will be examined in the scoping inquiry established by Minister for Health Simon Harris.
That the number of inaccurate smear tests being reported by our national screening programme was unacceptably high
Unclear
As of yet, we do not have data showing the error rates at individual laboratories. This will be key to determining the quality of the screening service. It is, unfortunately, a reality that some abnormalities will be missed in screening. Screening is not infallible. A prestigious Cochrane review (considered the gold standard in medicine) into studies of smear tests from around the world reported that, for every 1,000 women screened, around 20 will have pre-cancerous changes. The review concluded that the test will identify 12 of the women, but will miss eight.
That CervicalCheck has cost more lives than it has saved
False
The incidence of cervical cancer has dropped by 7 per cent every year since the national screening programme was introduced. According to the Irish Cancer Society, in its first eight years the national cervical screening programme “has led to the identification of 1,300 cancers and 50,000 high-grade [high-risk] and 37,000 low-grade pre-cancerous cells”.
That the previous government might have stopped this debacle from happening if it had introduced mandatory open disclosure
Possibly
The failure to proceed with this left a vacuum. Doctors and the system did not adhere to the policy of open disclosure and inform women about previous false negative tests.

Film workers stage protest at IFB over working conditions

Workers in the Irish film and TV industry are calling for a representative on the Irish Film Board (IFB) to combat what they say are unfair working conditions.
Of the seven film board members, five are producers or directors, one is a chartered accountant and the chairwoman is Dr Annie Doona, president of the Institute of Art, Design and Technology Dún Laoghaire.
Liam Neville, a GMB union rep and driver in the industry, was one of the organisers of a protest of film workers outside the Irish Film Board and the offices of the Minister for Culture last week.
He claimed more than 100 film and TV workers, including drivers, trainers, hairdressers and make-up artists, had protested last week to call for a place on the board of the IFB, improved conditions of employment and more accountability for the public funding given to the industry. The workers will protest again this Tuesday outside the IFB and Leinster House.
People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett supported the protest and said: “There is no real transparency about the €70 million that goes into the film industry every year, between film board grants and section 481 tax relief, as to the process of who gets that money, how it is spent and what the outcomes are in terms of developing an industry and quality employment.”
James Hickey, chief executive of the Irish Film Board, said issues between workers and employers should be mediated through existing trade union agreements and, if necessary, be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.
“The IFB’s understanding is that the protest was organised through an anonymous email, apparently from a union source. When the IFB contacted the Irish Film Workers Association (IFWA), GMB and Siptu, they all said that they were not involved in organising the protest and would not be encouraging their members to participate,” he said.
Screen Producers Ireland (SPI) said it had become aware of a couple of planned protests outside the offices of the IFB and the department via an anonymous email that was in circulation, but not addressed to the association.
“The organisers of these very small protests were therefore not identifiable, although Richard Boyd Barrett, who was prominent in the events, seemed to identify a couple of groups that he claimed were the organisers. SPI was not contacted or engaged with by any of the participants.
“Resolution and discussion of any grievances can be and are carried out via normal, legitimate industrial relations processes. The events this week don’t reflect that good and accepted practice.”
SPI said it was looking forward to recommendations from a forthcoming Oireachtas committee report on the issue.

Gadget watch: Nokia on the highway to success

Highlight: Nokia has essentially gone for the mid-range max with the 7 Plus. By not trying to compete with the Galaxy S9, it actually creates an opening to do battle with it
Body


The return of Nokia as its own thing, and not a subsidiary of Microsoft, was a big shot in the arm a year ago, one that was broadly welcomed because the smartphone market somewhat needed a hard boot in the backside.
Add in the nostalgia factor, which Nokia played on hard, and this was a brand that had the goodwill required to at least make folks think about its handsets.
In this game of musical chairs, the 7 Plus needs to be a miracle worker not to be the one left out. There’s room for Samsung, Apple and possibly Huawei, with Sony also having its niche. After that matters dwindle, so standing out is the one thing the 7 Plus simply has to do. It doesn’t, yet somehow it still works.
Nokia has essentially gone for the mid-range max here. By not trying to compete with the Galaxy S9, it actually creates an opening to do battle with it.
While the price depends on the operator and contract, it comes in largely at a level that undercuts supercharged mid-rangers like the OnePlus 5T. That’s no small feat and the delivery is equally impressive.
The dual camera is right up there, ditto with the overall user interface, and it’s got the storage space of a top-end device. The only criticisms are that the bezel is a little on the thick side and the screen isn’t as eye-popping as the Huawei P20 Pro.
Nothing here would make the 7 Plus stand out among the heavyweight devices in the market. By targeting a lower point and pushing it to the limit, Nokia has found a sweet spot it can build on.
This is a device that will win more people over to a business that makes good phones. That’s the short-term goal here. Making more people realise that and spend on said phones helps with the journey back to relevance.
By not trying to get back to the top, Nokia’s made the road there a touch more feasible.

Getting the democracy we deserve

Highlight: Google’s referendum ad ban shows how outdated our election laws are – and it has filled the gap in deciding the rules on digital ads 
Body


The ban by Google of all abortion-related advertising in advance of the referendum on the Eighth Amendment is dangerous for Irish democracy.
If the printing companies who printed election posters decided, with just two weeks’ notice to voting day, to stop producing campaign placards, serious questions about censorship would be asked. So too if newspapers decided not to publish advertisements from political parties or if radio stations chose not to interview election candidates.
Instead, we have outsourced the regulation of the Irish democratic process to an American multinational technology company in Santa Clara County, California. Nameless internet executives over 8,000km away are making fundamental decisions about the governance of Irish elections – and not public representatives in Leinster House.
Unaccountable corporate entities who use tax structures to shield the majority of their international profits from taxation, are determining what is in the best interests of the Irish public – what information should be suppressed, what communication is objectionable.
Google’s outright ban on advertisements is sharply different from its embargo on foreign spending on adverts relating to the referendum. Facebook has introduced similar restrictions on foreign online advertising on its platform.
The ban on financial intervention of non-Irish citizens on elections and referendums has been public policy since 2001. The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001 prohibited foreign donations where the donor is not an Irish citizen. The circumstances of that amendment were due to the extraordinary level of donations Sinn Féin received from foreign donors in America and Australia in the late 1990s.
The intervention by Google and Facebook in blocking unregulated foreign cash from the abortion campaign is long overdue. It also highlights in big red letters the woeful failures of the Standards Commission. The state watchdog on campaign finance has not issued a single press release on the extraordinary loopholes which allow foreign citizens to influence Irish elections by financing advertising on social media platforms.
It is the voluntarily-run civil society organisation, Transparent Referendum Initiative, which has done all the running on this by producing evidence of 145 groups and individuals which have bought more than 350 Facebook ads about the referendum.
The only press release issued by the Standards Commission in the last six weeks of campaigning has been notice of a public hearing for next September in relation to alleged contraventions of the ethics laws by three councillors.
This relates to an RTE Prime Time Investigates programme on political lobbying in 2015. That is a glaring metaphor for the obvious failings of how we regulate Irish democracy. A reactive response to media concerns – three years after the event.
Those who favour or oppose the move by Google to ban all abortion-referendum-related advertising are doing so from their narrow perspective on the referendum. For instance, Together For Yes has described the Google manoeuvre as creating a level playing field between all sides “who can now seek to convince the Irish electorate by the strength of their argument and power of personal testimony, not by the depth of their pockets”.
This from the pro-repeal umbrella group which has raised over €800,000 from crowdfunding as of April 26, 2018, according to its website. That figure has passed the million mark in recent weeks with new fundraising drives.
In the emotive heat of a referendum campaign, the long-term implications of this intervention by Google into the Irish democratic process are lost. A company, whose business priority is to boost share prices, has made a determination about what information the Irish public will have access to.
The reaction to this decision is coloured by which side of the abortion campaign people are on. The potential ramifications for democracy have not yet sunk in.
After this month’s vote, the government has committed to holding a further six referendums this year and next. They include ballots on blasphemy, the role of women in the home, to extend voting rights to citizens living abroad, liberalising Ireland’s divorce laws and reducing the voting age to 16.
There is also the possibility of two nonbinding polls, known as plebiscites, to seek the views of voters in Dublin and Cork to decide if the cities should have directly elected mayors. This year may also witness a presidential campaign and a general election. Local and European elections will take place in 2019. In all, Ireland will have 11 separate political campaigns to endure over the next 18 months.
This exercise of power by Irish citizens will not be regulated in any meaningful capacity by the Standards Commission watchdog.
Our outdated election laws were introduced in the generation before social media and data-driven campaigning. This legislative gap has mandated American multinationals to decide what the rules are around digital advertising.
It has been easy for Google to have such a profound influence on the referendum campaign. Ireland has a reactive and powerless watchdog. A Referendum Commission which has not played an active role in fact-checking and reacting to debate. A cumbersome process of registering voters. An Electoral Commission promised but never delivered on. We get the democracy we deserve by the wilful ignorance of failing to regulate it.

Gifts Direct delivers the goods on GDPR compliance

Highlight: One Irish company has embraced the GDPR change and turned it into a positive
Body


This year’s Small Firms Association annual conference takes place on the eve of the date on which the much-anticipated general data protection regulation (GDPR) kicks into gear.
From May 25, the new regulation becomes law with the aim of harmonising data protection regulations throughout the EU.
But for many smaller businesses, the rush to be GDPR-ready can be overwhelming.
Many see it as another task on top of a mountain of others and fear that if they unknowingly breach the regulation they may face a fine.
But one Irish company has embraced the change and turned it into a positive.
For over 30 years the hugely successful giftsdirect.com, Ireland’s largest online gifts store, has delivered gifts and hampers worldwide. Its US-based site, theirishstore.com, has also proved a huge hit on the other side of the Atlantic serving the massive Irish-American market in particular.
And key to the day-to-day running of these sites is the ability to interact with customers, alert them to offers and to stay connected.
“Companies involved in direct marketing need to have unambiguous consent from those they wish to contact” said Fiona O’Carroll, chief operating officer with Gifts Direct.
“Everything has to be clear and explicit. This will be helpful for direct marketing companies because they will be marketing to customers who are interested in their products/services. It enables positive engagement with customers and that can only be a good thing for brands and for their customers.”
And it isn’t just in the area of marketing where a holistic approach is required. “The GDPR impacts other areas too, such as human resources and third parties. For instance, any third party companies that process customer data must be fully compliant too,” said O’Carroll.
In preparing for the introduction of GDPR, the very first step was understanding fully why the regulation change is to come into force and its aims and requirements.
“We found great supports in helping us to understand the process, including from the SFA and we attended seminars where GDPR was explained step by step. Once we learned of the seven principles of the legislation we started to put our plan together. We carried out a full assessment of our business operations to find out what data we hold and, crucially, what we do with it. Once we had all of that done we were able to accurately identify risk areas and are acting accordingly.”
For Gifts Direct it took a number of months to get GDPR-ready, but O’Carroll believes that once small businesses and their employees are aware of the GDPR rules the regulation will become somewhat second nature.
“We’re hearing very much now of the need for a ‘culture of compliance’ and companies will now start training their employees about GDPR so that they understand how and why it works from day one. By being built into the training programmes we will, hopefully, have compliance across the board in Irish business.”

After turning down a seven-figure takeover offer last year, Ali Ryan, chief executive of Goss Media, is planning to expand its business in LA this year.
“I did have an offer to sell the company just before Christmas, but I decided that we have a lot more work to do. I walked away from a €1 million deal because I felt we have a lot more to do, not only in Ireland, but in LA, and soon in other cities too,” she said.
“It wasn’t an easy decision to make and this was our fourth offer to date. It’s great to see we’re clearly doing something right that our competitors and other media brands are interested in us, but we have so many new things coming to the forefront over the next 12 months. Now is the time to push forward and expand.”
Ryan would not confirm the identity of the bidder for the media company. Last December, The Sunday Business Post reported that Irish-American investor Liam Lynch was in talks to buy Goss Media.
The company will be four years old next month. “In four years we have grown and changed hugely,” said Ryan. “And I’m more excited about the company now than I’ve ever been before.”
Goss Media trialled a sister site in Los Angeles last year and will launch a rebrand of its LA site by the end of the summer. Ryan said it would focus on red carpet news and video straight from events in Hollywood.
“I left my job as a journalist at the age of 24 to pursue a dream, to create content that no one else has and to create the biggest and best showbiz news site in the country and to rival some of the best sites in Hollywood. I’m not finished yet,” Ryan said.
Goss has just hired its first commercial director, Sarah- Emma Hughes, formerly sales manager at Deliveroo. Ryan said Goss had switched its focus from traditional advertising to unique content and events.
“Every site can offer banner ads, competitions. We’re honing in on special content that only we can offer clients in this country and around the world.”
Ryan ran the third annual Gossie Awards last February. She said she planned on doubling the size of the event next year and that the firm would announce new events this summer. Goss also has an in-house creative agency, Create, which helps companies to improve their brand awareness through services including content creation and social media. It currently runs a showbusiness show, The Daily Goss, but will also be releasing new documentaries and one-off specials, featuring celebrities and influencers, as well as a podcast.

Government to fight attempt to alter banks’ tax amnesty

Highlight: Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin are increasing pressure on the minority government to limit the capacity of bailed out banks such as AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB to offset historic losses against their current tax bills
Body


The government is to block opposition efforts to change the law that allows the state’s bailed-out banks to avoid paying corporation tax for decades to come.
Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin are increasing pressure on the minority government to limit the capacity of bailed out banks such as AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB to offset historic losses against their current tax bills.
Both parties are now likely to push for changes in October’s budget with Fianna Fáil understood to be “minded” to seek a change in the law and Sinn Féin demanding one.
But the government will resist these efforts, with sources ruling out changes to the law on the use of ‘deferred tax assets’ (DTAs) which allow companies, including banks, to offset historic losses against taxes they would normally pay on profits.
Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman Michael McGrath said that although his party was awaiting the publication of a Department of Finance report on how changes to DTAs would affect banks, it “undoubtedly sticks in the craw of a lot of people that banks we bailed out will not have to pay any tax for a long number of years”.
Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty is proposing that the law be changed so that banks specifically would only be allowed carry forward 25 per cent of their losses to offset against tax.
He also wants a so-called sunset clause of ten years. Doherty said: “Changes need to happen for financial institutions. It’s one of our key demands and it would bring in in the region of €200 million.”
The sunset clause is being recommended in a draft Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report which The Sunday Business Post published details of last week. It would impose a time limit, so that banks would only be able to write off their historic losses for a certain period. If they still had historic losses ‘left over’ after this period, they would lose the ability to use them to write off tax.
In response to queries last week, the Department of Finance said a report on the effect of limiting tax reliefs on losses carried forward for banks would be published in June. On the PAC’s draft report, it said: “The department will consider the report and any recommendations set out therein when we receive the report.” However, a well-placed government source said no changes were being planned and predicted a row with the two main opposition parties in the run-up to October’s budget. “They can see it’s a popular issue, but we’re not budging,” the source said.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe signalled in March that the current regime was unlikely to change.
Meanwhile, sources in the financial sector have been weighing up the potential impact of a sunset clause on the value of the state’s shareholding in Irish banks.
One source bemoaned the political attention on the banking sector, saying: “Banks are always easy whipping boys, and they’ll be ripe for whipping during that election posturing. You wouldn’t want to own a bank stock during that period.”

Featuring elegant period features, refurbished interiors and six bedrooms, Bellewstown House in Co Meath will tick a lot of boxes for buyers seeking a substantial country home in prime condition.
However gardeners will likely be drawn most to the sprawling grounds of this south-facing Georgian residence, which are planted with some 120 tree species, including weeping beech, magnolia, scarlet oak, snowbell, strawberry and handkerchief.
Set on six acres of land, Bellewstown House is on the market through Sherry FitzGerald for €1.15 million, down from an asking price of €1.85 million in 2009, when its current owners first put it up for sale. It was last sold for over €2 million in 2007. The three-bay property dates back to roughly 1770, according to the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, and was renovated about a decade ago. It extends to 300 square metres over three levels, and is BER exempt.
Located off the main road leading into nearby Bellewstown village, the residence is approached by a long avenue behind stone pillars, running up to a forecourt overlooking the front gardens. A spoked fanlight sits atop the double doors of the main entrance, which open into a reception hall with a winding staircase.
To the right is a carpeted drawing room with a marble fireplace, sash window, ceiling coving, centre rose and cream-coloured walls. The dining room, on the left, is fitted with display units but otherwise almost identical in style.
At the rear of the ground level is a kitchen with an Aga cooker, original quarry tile floors and side access to the west-facing garden. The rear hallway also leads into a WC and dual-aspect living room with three sash windows.
Upstairs, on the first level, are four bedrooms and a main bathroom. The carpeted master bedroom has built-in wardrobes and an en suite with a bath, sink and lavatory. Two more bedrooms, both with original pine floors, are on the second floor.
Bellewstown House is deep in horseracing country, and equestrian enthusiasts are well catered to here by five large loose boxes and a paddock with separate access from the main road. The grounds of the property also hold a cobbled courtyard, full-size tarmac tennis court, farrier’s shed and garden store. Lawns to the front are screened from the road by mature trees running along the stone wall boundary.
The property, which has well water and septic tank drainage, also enjoys views over the surrounding countryside. Its lands are unzoned but offer good potential as a residential site with the appropriate planning permission, according to the agents.
Just a few hundred metres from the property is Bellewstown Racecourse. There are several equestrian centres also within a short distance of the house.
Bellewstown village has a primary school, a shop, a Catholic church, two pubs and GAA grounds, while Bellewstown Golf Club, a stone’s throw away from the house, has an 18-hole, par-72 course. On a clear day, there are views from the village across the sea towards the Mourne Mountains.
Drogheda town centre is about 11 kilometres away, offering a wide range of shopping and leisure facilities, as well as the Belfast to Dublin rail service. Dublin Airport is a half an hour drive via the M1, while Dublin city centre is about 50 kilometres away. St Patrick’s National School in Stamullen, Duleek Boys National School, and the Franciscan College in Gormanston are among the local schools, all a few minutes’ drive away.
Viewing is by appointment. For more details, contact joint selling agents Philip Guckian of Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes at 01-2376308 or Giles Belton of Sherry FitzGerald Lannon at 041-9838168.

Body


Minister for Health Simon Harris has said that he wants to see women given access to the more accurate HPV test for cervical cancer before October.
The new test provides 60–70 per cent greater protection than the current smear test and will result in fewer women getting a false negative result.
Harris said he was due to get a briefing from officials next week about the potential to introduce the HPV test before the target date of October.
“It will actually reduce the number of smears a woman will need to have taken, while also reducing the number of false negatives,” he said.
Harris said he would be looking at whether there was the capacity to do the new HPV testing in Irish labs rather than US labs.
He insisted that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s emotional reaction to the cervical check scandal last Friday was not a case of ‘crocodile tears’.
“The Taoiseach of this country is like everybody else in this country – shocked, upset and concerned,” he said.
Harris was speaking at an event to promote a Yes vote in the Eighth Amendment referendum, which was attended by former European Commissioner Máire Geoghegan Quinn, Fine Gael TD Frances Fitzgerald and Labour TD Joan Burton.
Burton said the cervical check scandal showed there had been a failure to talk about women’s health in this country, while Fitzgerald said the focus had to be on giving every possible support to the women affected.
Geoghegan Quinn said there should also be a focus on continuing to promote the HPV vaccine for young girls and the cervical tests for women.
“The one thing I would have concerns about is that women might now not decide to go for a cervical screen. We are all united – absolutely go for your cervical screen,” she said.

Lissaniskey House, near Nenagh in Co Tipperary, was once home to Dr Barry Edward O’Meara, the surgeon on HMS Bellerophon when Napoleon Bonaparte surrendered.
O’Meara travelled with Napoleon to exile on St Helena, becoming his physician and friend. When published after Napoleon’s death, his diaries, detailing the ill-treatment meted out to his patient, caused a sensation. This week, three centuries of acquisitions will go under the hammer at Sheppard’s two-day sale.
The sale runs the gamut from serious porcelain, a Chinese blue and white dragon bowl “possibly Ming” (€20,000-€30,000), to a novelty bronze and ivory barber’s bottle opener (€200-€300). Succeeding generations added to the collection, thus we have Queen Anne, Irish Georgian, Regency, Edwardian, Art Nouveau and Art Deco furniture and furnishings – and a painting by Robert Ballagh.
Headline furniture includes a pair of 19th-century painted demi lune console tables (€8,000-€12,000), a 19th-century Venetian lacquered cabinet-on-cabinet (€2,500-€3,500), a large satinwood display cabinet, circa 1790 (€3,000-€5,000), a William IV four-poster (€1,500-€2,500), and a large pair of Irish 18th-century giltwood pier mirrors (€4,000-€6,000).
[caption id="attachment_416289" align="alignleft" width="216"] An 18th-century table-sized marble reproduction of the Venus de Milo[/caption]
For walnut lovers, there’s a pair of Irish George I walnut armchairs (€2,500-€3,500), a George II red walnut bureau bookcase, circa 1740 (€3,000-€5,000), and a pair of Irish 19th-century walnut library chairs (€1,200-€2,800).
A very personal piece leads the sale: a platinum, white and gold Colombian emerald necklace, the emeralds 24 carats (€30,000-€50,000). Its wearer was also partial to silk scarves: choose from Hermès and Odile St Germain, estimates €150-€300.
An Irish silver highlight is an 18th-century soup tureen by Dublin maker Richard Calderwood (€1,500-€2,500). On a tight budget? Bid for the silver shoe horn (€30-€50).
Art embraces almost every European tradition, with a preference for French, English and Irish. Likely to achieve the top prices are three works by Eugene Delacroix (pencil, ink and watercolour) each with an estimate of €8,000-€10,000, and The Doge’s Palace, Venice, an oil by Spanish artist Raphael Sinet y Pérez (€10,000-€12,000).
The most charming piece of marble sculpture is an 18th-century table-sized Venus de Milo (€800-€1,200). Odd man out is an item from below stairs, a sturdy 18th-century butcher’s block, (€600-€800).

Housing group has €350m fund for affordable rental scheme

Forecastle, a new real estate group, has secured significant funding to provide thousands of affordable rental homes for teachers, gardaí, nurses, firefighters and young professionals on entry-level incomes who are being priced out of the rental market.
It has secured an initial €350 million from AIB and met with housing minister Eoghan Murphy and his senior officials, and according to one source has been working with the Department of Housing and the Housing Agency as well as with AIB on a potential state-backed element to its plans.
It expects to deliver 3,500 to 4,000 homes under this plan, of a mix of size and location, as part of a long-term affordable rental solution for key frontline services staff and young professionals nationwide, but initially in the greater Dublin area. It would later roll out five special purpose vehicles nationwide.
A source familiar with the plans said it hoped to deploy €1 billion of investment into the provision of these affordable rental homes over a four- to five-year rollout period.
Forecastle’s fund would commit to take up to 20 per cent of new pipeline housing developments from small and medium-sized builders and developers on a pre-sales basis, thus enabling the developers to access development finance and increase overall supply of new homes.
It plans to establish a charitable trust and run on a not-for-profit basis, and a legal structure has been devised by Dublin legal firm Philip Lee.
The pilot programme for the plan will be rolled out in coming months.
Rental accommodation would be offered with initial rents discounted by around 25 per cent of market rent.
Annual rental increases would be consumer price index-linked for the life of the tenancy, which Forecastle believes will enable young families on entry-level salaries in teaching, nursing and other professions to save and make life choices with some certainty.
It hopes that the pilot will be approved by the Department of Housing and will move into a larger-scale rollout that thousands of families will see the benefit of in coming years.
Directors include tax consultant Marie Bradley, Peter Martin of British-based Sanctuary housing group, construction professional Niall Greene and chartered accountant David O’Regan.
Martin Roche, a former chief financial officer with McCabe and Cosgrave property groups, is managing director.
Current government policy in relation to subsidised housing is quite rigid on new schemes that don’t relate to the most severe area of social housing need, but the group believes it has positive support from the Housing Agency for its plans.
It may need to become an approved housing body to avail of the state’s capital advance leasing facility, which at any rate has modest funds. It may be more likely to receive state support in the form of local authority lands.

How Microsoft put pressure on Ireland in US drugs case

Highlight:  Microsoft said Ireland needed to show ‘digital leadership ’ by backing firm in US Supreme Court 
Body


Secret documents have revealed that US computing giant Microsoft piled pressure on Ireland in a landmark case over access to emails at the centre of a drug-trafficking probe.
The drug case saw Microsoft face off with the US government over demands that the tech superpower give access to emails at the centre of the investigation which are stored in Ireland.
In private emails seen by this newspaper, Microsoft strongly criticises the government’s previous submissions in the case, going as far as to write a suggested template for an Irish submission to a US supreme court case which remedied what it saw as weaknesses in Irish legal filings.
Microsoft told Ireland that its submissions to US courts examining the case “created unnecessary confusion”, with the company telling the Department of the Taoiseach, “we think its [sic] essential that Ireland correct the record” on its submissions. Despite the potential for diplomatic difficulties arising from Ireland’s decision to take a stance opposing the US government, Microsoft wrote “it becomes essential that (Ireland) makes its points more forcefully and clearly than it did in its Second Circuit (Court) briefs”.
Ireland initially supported Microsoft’s case, but later changed its stance to ‘neutral’ in documents filed to the US circuit and supreme courts.
The correspondence between Microsoft and the Department of Justice makes clear the company’s frustration over what it saw as failures in the Irish submissions to the case, which the company descibes as “not as clear as it should have been”.
While Microsoft won the initial case that Ireland made submissions on, it was later appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. In emails requesting a further submission for the supreme court case, Microsoft sharply critiqued Ireland’s previous efforts.
The US company also accused Ireland of misinterpreting relevant Irish case law, specifically a legal action known as the Walsh Case.
“The Irish brief,” wrote Microsoft, “also created unnecessary confusion about Ireland’s domestic laws for subpoenas, with a distorted description of Ireland’s Walsh case.” The company added that “this too has been picked up in the (US government) brief this week”.
“We think its [sic] essential that Ireland correct the record on the Walsh case in its next brief,” the company’s senior attorney wrote.
“The letter went on to make exhaustive suggestions on how Ireland should adjust its submissions, and again critiqued the arguments Ireland made in its first tranche of legal documents.
On one point, Microsoft wrote: “The argument made does not clearly say: Irish laws prohibit transfers, and such direct demands like the warrant violate national sovereignty . . . the brief should make the following points under this heading,” before suggesting changes and relevant points to make.
The letter concludes: “We hope that Ireland agrees this is an important moment for it to show its digital leadership.”
Microsoft’s position was supported by letters from the American Chamber of Commerce, which also suggested wider legal reform, and Ibec, the Irish business lobbyist.
The company, which was founded and is still led by US billionaire Bill Gates, also urged Ireland to wait until the European Commission had made good on its promise to file a supporting brief to the case before submitting its updated documents.
However, Ireland forged ahead with plans to submit its brief last December. After those plans were made public, Microsoft wrote to the Department of Justice stating that it “strongly believes that Ireland should wait to file in January so its filing can take into account the amicus brief that the European Commission will file next week”. In the same letter, Microsoft again said “it’s important the Irish brief better informs the Supreme Court on the application of Irish and EU law in this litigation”.
Another Microsoft lawyer also emailed the Department of Foreign Affairs repeating criticism about the Irish position, and pointing out that the US government “exploits” failures in the Irish brief.
A brief reply to Microsoft from a Department of Justice official reads: “Clearly it’s a matter for government, and I understand you are reaching out at various levels.”
In a statement, Microsoft said that its views on the importance of data protection and privacy are well documented, and that it shared these views with governments, legislators and business representative bodies all over the world.
It said its view is that “having the right regulatory and policy environment to protect our customers’ data is crucial”.
“Microsoft is appreciative of the face that the Irish government filed amicus briefs at two important junctures in the Warrant Case. We have previously publicly thanked the government for its support in this matter.”

How the Iran nuclear deal works... and what ending it could mean

The Iran nuclear deal could be summed up with the proverb that half a loaf is better than no bread. It postponed, rather than eliminated, the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapons programme. But in the absence of the deal, nuclear weapons analysts believe Iran could build a nuclear weapon in less than a year, accelerating the prospect of a conflict involving Iran, the US and Israel.
Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main rival, has warned that if Iran restarts its nuclear weapons programme, it too will take steps to achieve nuclear capability, triggering a nuclear arms race in an already war-torn region.
The main aim of the landmark 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The deal was finalised in Vienna that year after more than two years of exhaustive diplomacy. There were seven signatories to the pact including Iran, the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany.
The Iranian government agreed to three main concessions:
 Reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 per cent
 Capping uranium enrichment at 3.67 per cent - a level potent enough to continue meeting the country’s energy needs, but not enough to build a nuclear bomb
 Getting rid of two-thirds of its centrifuges. Under the deal, it can use no more than 5,060 first-generation centrifuges for a decade. Nuclear weapons experts say these are so old and so few in number that they pose virtually no threat.
It also agreed to limit uranium research and development, and to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wide access to its nuclear facilities. The deal would expire in 2025, but curbs on Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons’ capability would stay in place after that.
In return for IAEA-certified compliance, an ongoing requirement, all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran were removed in January 2016. The reprieve allowed Iran to access international energy and financial markets.
In addition, $100 billion in frozen Iranian assets was released. After debt repayment, Iran received somewhere between $38 billion and $62 billion. The US separately reimbursed $1.7 billion, a refund - plus interest - of a non-fulfilled 1978 order for $400 million worth of military goods that was made by the Shah of Iran shortly before he was overthrown.
Two criticisms of the deal are that Iran’s people have yet to feel its benefits and now that Iran has shaken off the yoke of sanctions, it has used its access to cash to meddle in other wars in the region – including Syria.
However, the latter isn’t entirely true. Iran’s military backed the Assad regime as far back as 2013. Even so, there is little doubt that Iran’s ability to take on its Sunni Arab rivals in the region has increased since the lifting of sanctions. Iran has also conducted ballistic missile tests, although it did not violate the terms of the deal by doing so.
Trump has routinely referred to the deal as “insane”, “horrible” and “one-sided”. During the election, he signalled his intent to pull out of it if he won.
Democrats argue that Trump’s desire to pull out of the historic agreement is fuelled by his determination to dismantle every signature domestic and foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration.
International signatories to the deal have condemned the US withdrawal, noting it is the sole violator of the deal at this point. They also point out that Trump has offered no alternative, and as a result has escalated tensions both in the region and globally.
Since coming into office at the end of last month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has backed Trump’s withdrawal, calling Iran “the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world”.
National security adviser John Bolton is likewise a vitriolic opponent of the deal, preferring to use military force to inhibit Iran’s ability to build a nuclear weapons programme. However, US Defense Secretary James Mattis did not support the deal and is opposed to any US military intervention in Iran.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also a fierce opponent of the deal, urged Trump to abandon it. Netanyahu and Bolton are longtime friends and allies. Pompeo has said the US is “determined that Iran will never possess a nuclear weapon”. But he has not indicated whether this aim would be pursued by military or diplomatic means.
After Trump’s announcement, Hassan Rouhani, a moderate cleric, said Iran would abide by its commitments while it consults with the other signatories to the agreement. But the Iranian leader ordered the country’s atomic industry organisation “to be fully prepared for subsequent measures if needed so that in case of need we will start our industrial enrichment without limitations”.
