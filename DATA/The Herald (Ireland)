Charging ahead: VW becomes biggest German firm as investors bet on electric

Volkswagen (VW) surpassed SAP to become Germany's most valuable public company yesterday, driven by growing investor confidence it can supplant Tesla as the global electric vehicle leader.
VW's preference shares rose 11pc at the close in Frankfurt yesterday, valuing the automaker at about €139bn, roughly €13bn more than SAP.
Vaulting past Europe's biggest software company marks a spectacular comeback for the German industrial giant, which last topped the country's DAX Index six years ago, shortly before the bruising experience of the diesel-emissions cheating crisis.
Several companies have held the title over the past few years including Wirecard AG, the financial technology firm that went bust in one of Germany's biggest accounting scandals.
While Tesla remains the world's most valuable automaker by far at roughly $640bn (€535bn), VW's recent rise shows that investors have started to give credit the most aggressive push into electric cars by a traditional manufacturer.
Chief executive Herbert Diess this week made back-to-back announcements on how he plans to turn VW into the leading electric-car company, earmarking investments in battery factories and a slew of new plug-in models.
VW plans to bolster its software operations to 10,000 staff, making it one of Europe's biggest technology outfits after SAP, which first snatched the German stock-market crown from Siemens in July 2012.

'Breast milk bank saved my baby's life'

A mother of four has urged support for Ireland's Milk Bank after donated mother's milk helped critically support her miracle baby who was born at just 29 weeks and weighed only 460g (1lb).
Rebecca Fahy from Mayo paid an emotional tribute to the skilled doctors and nurses at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) at Holles Street in Dublin and the Fermanagh-based Milk Bank for their incredible support of her tiny daughter, Roisín. The Castlebar mother was rushed to NMH in early November from Mayo Maternity Hospital amid indications baby Roisín would be born prematurely.
"I was admitted to Holles Street three weeks before the birth and Roisín was delivered on November 23," she said.
Roisín was delivered at just 29 weeks - and weighed only 460g, around the weight of a package of butter.
The baby was so small she could fit in the palm of an adult's hand. Because the tiny infant's gut wasn't fully developed, she couldn't feed on formula and relied entirely on mother's milk. But eventually this had to be supplemented.
Thrived
Donor milk was supplied from the Milk Bank at Irvinestown in Fermanagh by Western Health and the Social Care Trust.
Roisín thrived and stunned doctors and nurses with her growth. By January 23 she was well enough to be transferred to Mayo General Hospital to be closer to her family.
Roisín is now 1.7kg in weight and is responding very well to care. "She is absolutely gorgeous," her mother said.
Rebecca hopes the little girl will soon be able to make her first trip home to spend time with her adoring siblings.
"We are so grateful to the doctors and nurses at NMH -they are absolutely incredible.
"We are also very grateful for all the support from the Milk Bank. I didn't even know it existed before Roisín was born but it was a critical support."

Laura Whitmore has released a photo of her growing baby bump ahead of the birth of her first child with husband Iain Stirling.
The TV presenter said she will catalogue the growth of her tummy after she was warned by mothers to take photos as it gets bigger or she would "regret not having the memories of the journey".
Whitmore, who is in the third trimester of her pregnancy, married Stirling in a secret ceremony in Dublin last month.
The Bray woman said it was taking a while to get used to the changes happening with her body.
In an Instagram post yesterday, the Love Island presenter wrote: "Coming soon... only really started taking pics of bump in third trimester.
"It's such a personal time. One thing I've been told is to take pictures or I'll regret not having the memories of the journey.
"Takes a while to get your head around the body changes.
"Woke up and realised I was wearing my old pants. Think they have a very different meaning now."
Magical
Addressing the couple's secret wedding, she finally confirmed it and said they did not make the news public until it was leaked as they "loved having it to ourselves".
Whitmore described the ceremony as "magical".
"Entering 2021 like... A year ago, Iain asked me to marry him and we had the most magical, perfect ceremony. We loved having it to ourselves," she said.
"We had been planning the perfect celebration and I will forever be so thankful that's what we got.
"We have never spoken publicly about our engagement or wedding.
"Back at the time, we never felt the need to say anything as it's all such a personal experience.
"We also were too busy enjoying it."

'Phased reopening' of schools on the cards

Ireland is "rapidly approaching" a scenario where the "phased reopening" of schools is possible, Professor Philip Nolan has said.
He said that the number of cases of Covid-19 could drop to 200-400 cases a day by the end of February if the current progress is maintained.
Professor Philip Nolan, of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), revealed the new figures yesterday but warned "that there is still a long way to go."
"That is still a pretty high level of disease," he said, but added: "It will allow us to do certain things perhaps."
He pointed out that "we are coming off a very large wave, one so large, I don't think any of us anticipated a wave of disease that big.
"However, what we proved over the last four weeks is something that we knew, that the basic public health measures - reducing contacts, social distance, hygiene - they work against the new variant.
"You just have to work harder at it to prevent viral transmission, and we have done that. I am optimistic about where we will go in March, April, May and June," he told RTÉ's This Week radio programme.
"If we are cautious, I think there are certain high priority, lower risk things that we can do in March, April, May, that will allow us some opening up without a significant increase in the transmission," he said.
Suffering
In relation to schools re-opening, he said that it was important to realise that schools in their entirety remained open through the October surge of cases.
Separately, Prof Nolan pointed out that: "The number in hospital has fallen significantly, the number in ICU has plateaued, importantly the number of new admissions per day is down.
"Each number is an individual story of suffering and trauma; each admission you prevent is worth the sacrifices you've made."
Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, said: "We have experienced over 1,000 deaths and more than 100,000 cases in January 2021.
"The efforts by all of the population in following the basic public health advice has seen us reduce the incidence of the disease very rapidly compared to most countries in Europe."

Care homes for religious not part of vaccine roll-out plans

Calls have been made to include a number of unregistered congregated settings for older people that have been left out of the vaccination roll-out in nursing homes.
Care settings catering for elderly members of religious orders, where dozens of retired nuns and priests are being cared for outside the remit of the Health Information Quality Authority (Hiqa), have not been listed for vaccination.
It is understood that many of the settings, where some members are in their 80s and 90s and are cared for by privately contracted healthcare workers and nurses, had outbreaks of Covid-19 last year. Deaths occurred as a result.
The current phase of the roll-out, covering people aged over 65 who live in long-term settings, includes a list of public and private nursing homes that are Hiqa-registered providers of care.
Since 2009 all nursing homes, public or private, are registered and inspected by Hiqa. This includes a number of nursing homes operated by religious organisations.
However, Hiqa's remit does not extend to the regulation of residential centres catering for elderly members of religious orders.
Under Section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, premises in which the majority of persons being maintained are members of a religious order or priests of a religion are offered an exemption to registration.
It is understood that because the settings do not technically fall under the strict definition of a nursing home, they have not been included in the current list for vaccinations.
"I think given the ethics of it this should be looked at," Sarah Lennon, executive director of Sage Advocacy, a charity that represents older people, told the Herald.
"During our discussions with the HSE and the Department of Health on the vaccine allocation list we were told that it is about the preservation of life first.
"The nursing homes were identified because of that, not because they are nursing homes, because they are congregated environments with people over a certain age," she said.
"These settings with older people from religious orders would seem to tick a lot of the same boxes.
"If we are talking about preservation of life and we know that these congregated environments are the ones that offer the most risk,  then it makes sense that they are prioritised."
In response to queries, the HSE said it is "currently gathering data on unregistered congregated settings for older persons with a view to agreeing a vaccination process for them".
In July, a paper published in the Journal of Nursing Home Research, which detailed the Covid-19-related deaths of four nuns in a convent in the southwest, highlighted the plight of care homes run by religious orders during the pandemic.
The four nuns died, and 12 out of 14 in their order tested positive, as the care system "collapsed" in their home during the height of the pandemic, according to the research paper.
Unregulated
The "significant" outbreak of the disease in the residence of a religious order "highlights the need to review these unregulated homes", the authors, geriatricians from the HSE, Mercy Hospital in Cork and Clonakilty Community Hospital, said.
Religious organisations were reluctant to give access to HSE staff during the crisis as residents were cocooning in accordance with Government regulations, the paper said.

GPs fear lack of vaccines for over-70s 'could lead to a lot of tensions with patients'

Many GPs fear a lack of Covid-19 vaccines for over-70s will cause turmoil as the supply will not meet huge demand among older people.
There are also concerns that a shortage of GPs in parts of rural Ireland will lead to delays in vaccinations.
Dr Ken Egan, a Mayo GP, said he has been contacted by many of his colleagues whose practices are already inundated with calls from older people about the vaccine.
The former president of the Irish Medical Organisation said it could take 12 weeks to fully vaccinate all the over-85s, the first group of older people who are to be offered the two-shot vaccine later this month.
"GPs are afraid the shortage of vaccines will cause chaos. It could lead to a lot of tensions between patients and doctors," he added.
"Health Minister Stephen Donnelly needs to be upfront with people and tell them they will get vaccinated but it will take longer."
"There will need to be guidelines on the priority order," added Dr Egan.
The first advertisements informing over-85s that "Covid-19 vaccinations are on the way" appeared in newspapers yesterday, telling people "your GP will let you know" when a vaccine is available and everyone will receive one when "it's their turn".
It is expected supplies of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, the first of which are to arrive next week, will only amount to 285,000 doses in February and March, down from the 600,000 which had been expected.
Although there were hopes last night that the number of doses arriving here could be increased after the EU announced that AstraZeneca agreed to deliver an extra nine million in the first quarter of the year.
Unclear
This could mean another 90,000 doses for ­Ireland.
There are also hopes of an increase in deliveries from Pfizer BioNTech, although large numbers of health staff have still not been vaccinated.
Everyone who gets the vaccine needs two doses and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee will decide on the gap which can range from four to 12 weeks.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is 60pc effective in people aged under 55 and there is a lack of data on the response of older people due to the smaller numbers involved in the trials.
However, it was licensed by the European Medicines Agency for people over 18 and it said it expects protection for older age groups, although it is unclear what level it will be.
Meanwhile, Dr Ruairi Hanley, a GP in Co Louth, said the plan is for GPs to provide rapid vaccination clinics for the entire older population as more supplies of the vaccine become available.
"GP surgeries may simply not be feasible in some parts of the country," he said.
"The truth is that there is a GP manpower crisis in rural Ireland due to the unwillingness of many younger colleagues to practise medicine beyond the M50.
"While I have no doubt that south Dublin would have no shortage, elderly people in rural Ireland may not be so lucky.
"Delays may be inevitable as there are only so many hours doctors and nurses can work."
He called on the HSE to arrange for vaccination centres where Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccines would be offered "instead of waiting for GPs to save the day".
There are 500,000 people aged over 70s in the country, including 81,000 over 85 and 90,000 aged 80-84.
Mr Donnelly said the roll-out to the over-70s will begin this month, with every effort being made to deliver the programme "as rapidly and as safely as possible".
Ireland expects to have a total of 1.1 million vaccines doses by March.
As of Wednesday 161,500 doses were administered, 71,600 of which were first doses to residents and staff in long-term care facilities.
Meanwhile, the Irish public reacted to thumb gate last night, giving Mr Donnelly his own medicine on Twitter.
His Twitter ignited with hundreds of people tweeting a thumbs up emoji but it certainly wasn't for the right reasons.
Mr Donnelly tweeted: "This is progress and will mean more vaccines for Ireland in the next two months."
He was reacting to Ursula von der Leyen's tweet on the AstraZeneca nine million additional doses for the EU.
Twitter users were far from impressed with the spin after it was revealed Mr Donnelly had sent a thumbs up emoji by text to chief medical officer Tony Holohan upon hearing the 'R' number had increased in Dublin in October.
Even Guardian columnist and activist Owen Jones gave Mr Donnelly a thumbs up emoji.

HSE faces barrage of legal claims due to delays in care, solicitors caution

The HSE is facing a flood of medical damages claims over the delayed diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening conditions because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Medical negligence claims cost the State €315m last year, but legal experts warned it is likely to "exponentially increase from 2021 onwards" because of how the pandemic has disrupted critical parts of the healthcare system.
Virus cases have pushed acute hospitals into crisis mode because of soaring patient numbers, intensive care demands and staff shortages linked to illness and the need to self-isolate.
While hospitals have tried to prioritise key services such as cancer care, unavoidable delays have hit other areas including screening, cardiac care, orthopaedics and neurology.
The National Screening Service said last month it was more than 60pc behind its annual screening target by September.
Its BreastCheck service was paused for more than six months at the height of the pandemic last year. By November 1, 153,000 women were awaiting mammograms.
Bowel screening and CervicalCheck services were also disrupted.
Fears are now mounting that normal two-year screening cycles may have to be extended to three years.
HSE chief executive Paul Reid acknowledged the pandemic had a massive impact on normal healthcare operations.
He said that at the height of the pandemic, there was a near standstill in normal activity.
In a submission last November to the Oireachtas Health Committee, he warned that while activity had resumed, "there have been enduring consequences" for the healthcare system.
Law firms are predicting they will be inundated with queries from patients alarmed at having vital assessments and treatments delayed.
Concerned
Michael Boylan, of Michael Boylan Litigation, a medical law specialist, predicted that firms will be inundated with legal queries from patients worried about delayed screening, diagnosis and treatment.
"I would absolutely agree that we are likely to be looking at an increase in medical claims because of the pandemic. We have already had calls from people concerned at delays in treatment," he said.
Firm partner Gillian O'Connor said the psychological impact of the virus on non-Covid-19 patients has been understated.
"People are worried about getting appointments, tests, a diagnosis and then treatment because of the way Covid-19 has disrupted the entire healthcare system," she said.
"Not to mention the fact that, according to the HSE's own figures, hospitals are one of the places where you can ­contract the virus."
Northern Ireland solicitor Patrick Mullarkey said there could be a tsunami of cases.
"The impact that we have already seen in delayed diagnosis and care will, in the very near future, see a significant rise in the numbers of patients presenting with complaints of a lack of care," he said.
Barrister Doireann O'Mahony confirmed numerous complaints from patients over delays to non-Covid-19 treatments.
"A lot of acute medicine is not getting the appropriate urgent attention because of the pressure on intensive care and beds in wards from Covid-19 and this is having a knock-on effect on other emergency situations," she said.
"The opportunity to intervene in cancer is lost when appointments are cancelled and patients are not seen, and the result of that is an increase in the number of people whose cancer spread and, sadly, the number of deaths.
"The pandemic is causing delays in screening and chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The lack of intervention is what kills people."
A HSE spokesperson said: "Since the onset of Covid-19 there has been significant reduction in all scheduled care activity across acute services including outpatient clinics, inpatients and day cases.
"This is in line with the National Action Plan on Covid-19 which recommended that services were to be maintained for urgent or time- critical patients only at the time."

Non-essential shops unlikely to reopen as restrictions ease - Martin

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has warned that non-­essential retail is unlikely to reopen after March 5 when current restrictions are due to be lifted.
The country is due to exit Level 5 at that point. However,  Mr Martin said he was committed to the "prolonged ­suppression" of the virus.
He was speaking as figures released yesterday revealed that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) had been notified of 1,247 new cases of Covid-19, and 15 additional deaths related to the virus.
Mr Martin said: "The Government will be having a series of meetings over the next while to deal with the medium-term situation."
However, he stressed that he saw education and construction as "immediate priorities", and he said the Government will look at other sectors.
"But I do not see a major reopening after March 5 quite yet," Mr Martin said on  This Week  on RTÉ Radio 1 yesterday. "A lot will depend on the numbers.
"We need to be conservative, and we need to be cautious in terms of what we do on March 5."
Hospitality will likely have to wait longer, for a wider vaccination of the population, he said, adding that he had  been straight with people on the roll-out.
Meanwhile, he said a "critical mass" of Irish people will be vaccinated by the autumn, despite the AstraZeneca row.
Obligations
But Ireland is down around 300,000 doses as a result of that vaccine company's announcement that it will not be able to fully meet its contractual obligations to the EU.
Ireland is expected to receive 1.1 million doses in the immediate weeks ahead, instead of an expected 1.4 million, Mr Martin said.
"We're hoping that we can make up some of that."
Last night it was expected that Ireland would receive another 90,000 doses after the EU announced that AstraZeneca had agreed to deliver another nine million doses in the first quarter of this year.
Mr Martin said he anticipated that May, June and July will be significant months of vaccination for the broad mass of the population.
Vaccinations remained "a moving target",  he said. "We have to be careful in giving precise commitments around vaccines because it does depend on supply," he said.
Separately, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said yesterday: "There is an onus on employers to ensure that, in the first instance, staff are encouraged to work from home and in cases where that is not possible, that their workplaces are safe for staff and customers and in full compliance with infection prevention and control measures.
"The HPSC has comprehensive guidance on outbreak management and infection prevention control measures that every employer should be familiar with and activating on their premises.
"I encourage all employers and managers to review their workplaces and ensure they have effective measures in place," he said.
There were 1,516 Covid-19 patients hospitalised yesterday, compared to 1,492 patients hospitalised on Saturday. The numbers in intensive care units remained the same on both days, at 211 patients.

Push to double knife crime jail sentences

Four Dublin councillors will table an emergency motion  at today's city council meeting, calling on Justice Minister Helen McEntee to act on previously suggested changes to knife crime laws.
The move would double the sentence for knife crime to 10 years.
Former Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O'Callaghan had proposed the change.
However, the Government has said there are no plans to amend the current legis- lation.
In the space of just over a week, Dublin's north inner city has witnessed a spate of knife crimes.
Teenager
A 14-year-old boy has been charged in connection with a knife attack that led to an office cleaner needing life-saving surgery after she was stabbed in the neck on January 20.
Last Tuesday, a teenager was stabbed on East Wall Road and died from his injuries.
Two days later, a man was stabbed in Seville Place.
The four councillors - Nial Ring, Christy Burke, Anthony Flynn and Cieran Perry - will call on the justice minister to immediately reintroduce Mr O'Callaghan's private mem- ber's bill.
The councillors will also call on the minister to immediately set up a task force to address, research and analyse the causes of the increase in knife crime.
Last October, around the time of the sentencing of a youth for the killing of Dublin teenager Azzam Raguragui, a Justice Department spokes- man said the Government is "very aware of the concerns which many members of the public hold with regard to the issue of knife crime".
Mr Ring said the impact of the recent knife attacks cannot be underestimated.
"People are literally living in fear and looking to the authorities for action," he said.
Mr Perry said legislation is "only one part of the jigsaw, but ultimately we need buy-in from the affected comm- unities".

Study may OK use of vitamin D in battle

The use vitamin D supplements in the battle against the coronavirus could be approved as a useful health boost by the end of this week.
A report on the advisability of promoting the use of the vitamin to aid the immune system has been sought from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).
Irish people have a vitamin D deficiency, which is most often derived from sunshine, Leo Varadkar told the Dáil last Thursday.
Independent TD Marian Harkin is urging the promotion of vitamin D and Mr Varadkar acknowledged: "A lot of Irish people are vitamin D deficient, not least because we don't have much exposure to the sun."
He added: "There is evidence of benefits (of vitamin D) in terms of Covid-19 outcomes. And there's very little evidence of any harm being done should somebody take vitamin D supplements."
Uncontroversial
Research from Spain, from the long-range Tilda project at Trinity College and from articles published in the British Medical Journal and The Lancet all suggest that it is "uncontroversial" to promote vitamin D for general use.
"There is a chance that it may be beneficial in terms of Covid-19 outcomes and the Government has asked Nphet to examine this and to provide us formal advice, which we can then stand over and give to the general public," Mr Varadkar said.
The HSE advice is that most people don't need extra vitamin D as they get sufficient in a balanced diet every day.
But the body cannot store vitamin D efficiently, and the Food Safety Authority and the HSE both recommend extra for all babies in their first year.
"Most people should be able to get enough vitamin D from a varied and balanced diet. But if you take supplements be careful not to take too much," the Tánaiste warned.
The literature indicates taking 25 micrograms or less per day is unlikely to cause any harm, he said, "and may cause some benefit".

'I don't know how many cars I have' - Shane

Shane Lynch has said he is never quite sure how many cars he has in his vast collection.
The Boyzone star (44) has owned models by Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Mercedes and Ferrari in recent years.
However, he said it was impossible to pinpoint what he had "on the driveway" because many of his models were being worked on all across the UK.
Outside of his work with Boyzone, the Dubliner has competed in the British GT Championship and British Drift Championship.
"My cars swap and change all the time because I'm a car lover. I'm a car nut. I'm a car enthusiast. I'm a car junkie. I have problems about cars," he said.
Lynch said he was like his mechanic father in that his car collection was constantly changing.
"I've always seen his driveways swap and change with machines, from American style to British style. He had a few German whips on there," he said.
"So my own was inherited from his love of cars. I get a crisis every few years of sell, sell, sell.
Builds
"I collect, collect and then look at them all and go sell, sell, sell and then I recollect."
Lynch said he always had at least three car builds on the go.
"They're always like six months to a year," he said, "so my car collection isn't quite direct, I can't pinpoint what's on the driveway."
Lynch has been announced as the face of the relaunched Men and Motors TV, which he will co-host with sports journalist Torie Campbell.
The channel first aired in 1996 and helped kick-start the careers of presenters including Richard Hammond and John Inverdale.

Dublin's clamping blackspots revealed, and worst culprits are all on southside of capital

Clamping in Dublin fell by half last year, but motorists on the southside were still the hardest hit.
Clarendon Street topped the list of blackspots in the capital where you are most likely to get clamped.
Dublin City Council (DCC) figures show Covid-19 lockdowns had a remarkable impact on parking enforcement rates, with 23,383 vehicles clamped last year - down more than 23,100 on 2019.
Only eight vehicles were clamped in the city at the height of the first lockdown last March compared with the monthly average of nearly 3,900 a year before.
Revenue
Reduced traffic levels also hit revenue from parking fees and fines.
Provisional figures indicate overall income from all parking revenue sources last year dropped by 38pc to just under €21m - down from €33.8m in 2019.
The bulk of revenue still comes from parking fees, which were down 37pc, or €11m, to just over €19m.
Around three-fifths of motorists now pay for parking in the city with their mobile phone through the Parking Tag app.
Clarendon Street is where motorists are most likely to have their vehicles clamped after a tenfold increase in the number caught parking there illegally.
A total of 625 vehicles were clamped on the street - which runs parallel to Grafton Street at the back of the Westbury Hotel - last year compared with 67 in 2019.
The South Circular Road - one of the longest thoroughfares in the city - remained  in second place with 369 vehicles clamped last year. That was nearly 250 fewer than in 2019.
Two roads in Ranelagh - Chelmsford Road and the main street (officially known as just Ranelagh) - were the next most common places to get clamped .
The figures show clamping blackspots are predominantly on the city's southside, with only two of the top 10 locations north of the River Liffey - Capel Street and Commons Street.
Mespil Road, which was the city's top blackspot for clamping vehicles in four of the previous five years, does not even feature in the top 10 clamping locations for 2020.
Last year, a total of 148 vehicles were clamped on the road - which runs along the Grand Canal between the bridges at Baggot Street and Leeson Street - compared with 911 in 2019.
Other areas that were previously a popular target for clampers, including Burling- ton Road, Parnell Street, Ormond Quay and Townsend Street, no longer feature in the main illegal parking blackspots.
The figures show the most common time for vehicles to get clamped last year was be- tween 8am and 10am, while clampers were busiest on Thursdays.
A council spokesperson said the impact of Covid-19 had reduced expectations of the number of vehicles that would be clamped.
However, the spokesperson said enforcement measures on clearways, bus lanes, cycle ways, footpaths and entrances to businesses and private homes were "a valuable and necessary service".
Despite reduced traffic levels, the figures show fees for reclaiming vehicles from the city pound in Harold's Cross rose by 11pc to €67,025 last year.
Illegally parked vehicles that are not removed within 24 hours are towed away and impounded, with the owners required to pay a release fee of €160 plus a daily storage charge of €35 to have them returned.
There are around 30,000 on-street parking spaces in the city, and vehicles were clamped at more than 1,400 locations last year.
Suburbs
Rates for catching offending motorists are even higher in parts of the suburbs controlled by the other three local authorities in Dublin.
Convent Lane in Dún Laoghaire had the highest number of parking fines in the city and county last year.
A total of 1,273 motorists were issued with €40 fines for parking on Convent Lane, next to Bloomfields Shopping Centre.
Main Street in Lucan was the only other location where more than 1,000 motorists were caught parking illegally.
Areas outside the city where motorists are targeted are Robinhood Road, Ballymount; Rock Hill, Blackrock; Cookstown Way, Tallaght; Main Street, Swords; and Monkstown Crescent, Monkstown.
Top 10 clamping  blackspots (Number of vehicles clamped)
1 - Clarendon Street - 625
2 - South Circular Road - 396
3 - Chelmsford Road - 294
4 - Ranelagh - 260
5 - South William Street - 255
6 - Merrion Square South - 253

Jason's goodbye to mum

Jason Isaacs has revealed he was able to be with his mother in her final moments due to a chance disruption in his filming schedule.
The Harry Potter star's mother Linda died in 2014 in Israel, where she had moved from the UK some years before, of complications related to cancer and dementia.
He told the Marie Curie podcast that by chance he had been filming a television series in the country, but production was halted after rockets were fired across the border with the Gaza Strip.
It meant Isaacs (57) and his brothers were able to be with her before she died.
Speaking to podcast host and grief expert Jason Davidson, he said: "Bombs started going off in Israel, rockets started coming across from Gaza.
"This was 2014, and the production I was shooting obviously shut down. The insurers shut it down.
"They sent everyone home and I got to stay just at the moment my mum moved into this place.
Fading
"She was there for months, fading away, not quite under- standing why she wasn't getting better but, you know, continually talking to doctors and stuff.
"Everybody around knew, not because we had a diagnosis, but because it was clear she was fading.
"I got to be with her there, and various brothers flew in at various stages, and my wife and kids flew out for a little bit, until she died and we buried her."

Leaving Cert students may not go back before March

Leaving Cert students may not go back to school until March, it is feared, as pressure mounts on the Government to make a decision on when the return will happen.
Another intense day of talks between education stakeholders resulted in no clear answers for parents or students.
With just four months left in the traditional school year, students still have no idea when they will be returning to class despite Tánaiste Leo Varadkar having stated on Monday that schools will reopen on a phased basis next month.
Opposition politicians have criticised the Government for failing to meaningfully engage with Nphet on what is needed to safely get children back to the classroom.
It comes as chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Nphet has given advice, and "is available to explain what that advice may mean but it's up to the education sector to plan the resumption of activities".
The Herald put 10 specific questions to the department including whether it has sought any advice from Nphet on a phased reopening, what criteria needs to be met for Nphet to recommend the return to education and what dates students are expected to start back.
The department did not respond to the specific questions but said "confidential talks" with unions and other education partners are ongoing.
Labour education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin hit out at the department, saying: "There's no sense of partnership, there's no sense of drive, there's no sense of being in control, there's no sense of being ahead of this thing.
"It's as if the department has almost given up."
He said that if the safe return of schools is a "Government priority", Nphet should be allowed play a bigger role.
Meanwhile, talks on plans for the Leaving Cert and Junior Cert exams this year were held yesterday and will continue next week.

RTÉ's Tommie is hailed as 'essential to peace process' as veteran journalist retires

RTÉ's retiring northern editor Tommie Gorman was an essential part of the Northern Ireland peace process, the Taoiseach said.
His versatility and wisdom shone through as he reported with humanity on the possibilities politics offered and the compromises required, Micheál Martin added.
Gorman's employer said he was the "beating heart" of RTÉ News after announcing the journalist from Sligo will step down this spring after 41 years with the broadcaster.
"Tommie Gorman is the quintessential professional who earned the trust of all who dealt with him," Mr Martin said.
"He understood better than most the possibilities politics offered and the compromises required to make progress.
"He brought us the daily news of an unfolding peace process. He was an essential part of that process."
Gorman was RTÉ's Europe editor before moving to Belfast in 2001.
He interviewed Roy Keane after the footballer's row with manager Mick McCarthy in Ireland's 2002 World Cup training camp on the island of Saipan.
He also tracked down Seamus Heaney on a Greek island after the poet had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Cancer
Diagnosed with cancer in 1994, Gorman said: "Ever since my diagnosis, work has been the ultimate distraction. You can lose yourself in work, you can lose yourself in living. You need to engage in living."
He has chronicled the ups and downs of the peace process for two decades.
Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster said Gorman always encouraged others facing difficult circumstances following his own public health challenges.
She said he tried to understand what made political leaders like her tick.
"I will miss Tommie incredibly from the political world, but of course I do consider him a friend, and that will continue," she said.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: "Tommie has given decades of selfless service to the people of this island."
The Taoiseach said Gorman's knowledge of detail and command of his subjects was unequalled.
"He has left a powerful journalistic legacy underlining the centrality of accuracy, humanity and trust," Mr Martin said.
RTÉ's northern correspondent Vincent Kearney will take over as editor.

Schoolboy gets €20k after cone broke toe

A school that offered a pupil €17,000 after he injured his foot was told told by a judge to think again and come up with more money.
The 15-year-old boy was injured after a teacher told him to move heavy cones in the playground.
Judge John O'Connor said in the Circuit Civil Court that Our Lady of Good Counsel Boys' National School could pay out as much as €25,000 to Joe Bennett, of Churchview Road, Killiney.
The judge granted the boy's barrister time to contact the school and inform it of the court's view before the settlement offer would be rejected and the case be sent to trial.
Grip
The barrister later told Judge O'Connor the school had increased its offer to €20,000.
Judge O'Connor had heard that in early February 2018, a teacher had told the then 12-year-old and another pupil to move cones that separated play areas.
The barrister said Joe had lost his grip on one of the wet cones, which fell on the big toe of his left foot.
"Liability has not been conceded, but we have the view of forensic engineer Karl Searson that the cone had been modified with the attachment to its base of a metal plate, making it unsuitable for being moved by children," the barrister said.
She said the boy had struggled through classes for the remainder of the school day.
The accident happened on a Friday, and the boy, due to increasing pain, had been taken to the accident and emergency unit of Tallaght Hospital, where it was found his big toe was fractured.
He had to have his nail punctured and the fluid drained.
He was on crutches for several days.
Judge O'Connor said the boy had suffered a great deal of pain and his social and sporting activities were affected.
He approved the increased compensation of €20,000.

Vaccine blow as effectiveness on older group now in question

A question mark hangs over whether the "gamechanger" Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine will be rolled out to all over-70s amid a lack of evidence on how well it will protect older people.
The vaccine was approved for everyone over-18 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) but its scientists said while there will be some level of protection for the over-55s they could not say how much because not enough were involved in its trials.
Germany has already decided the vaccine should only be given to people aged under 65, saying there is a lack of sufficient data to recommend use in older age groups.
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said last night: "The next step now is that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee will advise us on the use of the vaccine."
The experts will meet this weekend to analyse the date from the EMA and also decide of older age groups should be given the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.
The original plan was to roll out the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines to over-70s beginning with the over-85s through their GPs.
The minister said: "We now have access to three approved vaccines and will get 1.1 million doses in quarter one. We know we can begin the vaccination of those aged 70 and over."
A public information campaign for this group begins this weekend and they are advised they will be contacted by their GP.
However, vaccine task force chairman Brian MacCraith confirmed yesterday the expected 600,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is likely to be reduced to 300,000.
The European Commission is in a bitter row with AstraZeneca as the company is only supplying 31 million doses in the first quarter, 60pc less than agreed.
Earlier, the published contract between the Commission and the company indicated it covered UK plants which should deliver doses to the EU.
Last night the EU confirmed that under new rules, vaccine firms will have to seek permission before supplying doses beyond the EU
The EU member states will be able to vet those export applications.
The EMA said the two-dose Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is 60pc effective in preventing people who catch the virus getting ill.
Immune
Irish-born Emma Cooke, head of the EMA said: "While there are not yet enough results in older participants - over 55 years old - to provide a figure for how well the vaccine will work in this group protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines."
Dr Denis McCauley, GP spokesman for the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), said doctors here will await the decision of the advisory committee on what is the best way forward.
He said his advice to patients is to take "whichever vaccine they are given".
Pfizer held out the hope of increasing vaccine deliveries here after it announced modifications to its plant in Belgium will ease the scale-up of manufacturing capacities in Europe and deliver significantly more doses in the second quarter.
"Following this important upscaling work, Pfizer and BioNtech are now fulfilling deliveries to the European Union in line with the original agreed schedule, and continue to work toward increased deliveries beginning week of February 15, ensuring we will supply the fully committed quantity of vaccine doses in the first quarter and significantly more in the second quarter," the company said.
It comes as the number of new cases of the virus diagnosed here this month reached 100,000.
Another 48 Covid-19 related deaths were reported with those who died ranging in age from 30 to 99.
Hope
The number of daily cases fell to 1,254 confirming a downward trend.
There was also a drop in patients with Covid-19 in hospital to 1,518 and slight fall in intensive care to 211.
Among yesterday's cases 437 were in Dublin, 146 in Cork, 76 in Meath, 69 in Wexford, 62 in Kildare while the remaining 464 cases were spread across all other counties.
There is further hope on the horizon after it emerged a single-dose vaccine, manufactured by the US company Johnson and Johnson, is 100pc effective at preventing deaths and hospitalisations from Covid-19.
This means that one month after vaccination, no one who received the shot was admitted to hospital or died, regardless of which strain of coronavirus they were exposed to.
In the 44,000-person trial by the company's subsidiary Janssen, based in the Netherlands, they also found the vaccine prevented 66pc of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19.
Ireland has ordered 2.2 million doses of this vaccine. It has not yet applied for approval.

A woman in her 20s was fighting for her life yesterday after being forced into a public toilet and stabbed repeatedly while people called gardaí to break open the door.
The incident happened in the Markets area of Ennis, Co Clare, at around 6pm on Thursday night.
A source said the woman was seen arguing with a man who then assaulted her.
They said that after passers-by shouted at him and began to raise the alarm, the man gained access to a public toilet on the street and forced the woman inside.
The door was then locked and the concerned witnesses called gardaí.
"The fire brigade had to open the door, and when they did the man was arrested and the woman had suffered multiple stab wounds," the source said.

Mayor Mary Howard said the town was shocked by the attack.
"We are all thinking of the victim and hope she makes a full recovery," she said.
"You don't expect to hear of attacks like these in your local town, especially on a Thurs-day evening when things are quiet.
"People are upset and worr-ied about her. This kind of violence is awful."

A 72-year-old bottle of Glen Grant single malt Scotch whisky has fetched more than €44,500 at an auction in Hong Kong.
It was the first time the 1948 vintage had been offered in a sale.
The decanter is numbered 88 of 290 and was sold by Bonhams for 421,600 Hong Kong dollars, including premium.
It had a book estimate of 300,000 to 380,000 Hong Kong dollars (€32,000 to €40,360).
The whisky, the oldest from the Glen Grant distillery, is in a Dartington crystal decanter with an American black walnut presentation box.
Despite the economic uncertainty of the pandemic, interest in rare whiskies remains high.
Collectable
Compared with other investment commodities, collectable whisky has done well in the past 10 years, with a four-fold increase in prices, said wine and whisky specialist Christopher Pong.
Other whiskies in yester- day's auction included a 35-year-old Hibiki whisky from Japan that sold for HK$372,000 (€39,500).

4,500 passengers arrive into Dublin Airport in a three-day period

Almost 4,500 passengers arrived at Dublin Airport in the first three days of this week.
While still a tiny proportion of the number of passengers who would normally pass through arrivals, it underscores the challenge in persuading people not to undertake non-essential travel.
Of the more than 2,000 people who landed at the airport on Tuesday and Wednesday, about one-third was returning from holidays.
Flights are still operating from destinations such as Lanzarote and Malaga, some of the favourite hotspots for Irish sun-seekers.
All people over the age of six arriving in Ireland must now provide a negative or not detected PCR Covid test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival.
That has to be given to immigration officers on arrival.
But the Department of Justice said that 39 passengers had arrived between Monday and Wednesday without a negative Covid test. Of those, 28 landed at Dublin Airport.
Passengers without valid evidence of a negative Covid test can face a €2,500 fine or six months in prison.
The DAA, the semi-State company that operates Dublin Airport, said that 2,325 passengers arrived on Monday, 936 on Tuesday, and 1,202 on Wednesday.
That was out of a total of 4,665 arrivals and departures on Monday, 1,843 on Tuesday and 2,135 on Wednesday.
Separate figures from the Department of Transport showed that more than 2,100 passengers flew into Dublin Airport from Spain last week.
Landed
Spain topped the list of departure points for those arriving in Dublin Airport last week. It was followed by ­Britain (1,920 people flew in).
The new figures show 1,300 people arrived from the Netherlands, 1,174 from France and 1,055 from Romania.
They were followed by passengers from Portugal (991), Poland (972), Moldova (663), Turkey (591) and the UAE (537).
Figures for Cork Airport show 151 people arrived last week from Britain while 182 people landed in Shannon Airport, with the vast majority (135) travelling from Algeria.
In total, 14,757 passengers arrived in Ireland between Monday, January 18, and ­Sunday, January 24. This was down on the previous week when 18,226 people flew into Ireland; 33,808 arrived in the first week of January.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said this week that of the 800 people who came into the country through airports, 397 were returning from holidays.
Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport are around 95pc lower than ­normal.
Airlines across Europe are facing a "complete disaster", with traffic across the region expected to be 64pc lower this month compared to a year ago, according to Eamonn Brennan, the head of Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based agency that manages European airspace.
"It is clear that the months of February and March will be exceptionally low across the network," Mr Brennan said.
"Even April is expected to perform very poorly with only a limited pick-up for the Easter period."

Rugby legend Cian Healy has paid tribute to his wife Laura Smith after he become a father following the arrival of his new baby son.
The Ireland and Leinster prop opened his heart on Instagram, where he shared a photo of his son's tiny feet alongside a heartfelt message to Laura.
"I've been in awe of @ssssmithser for a very long time, even more so now having seen how she has taken to motherhood so well and proven that she is our family's rock," he wrote.
"We welcomed baby Beau Healy to the world on January 15 and every day since we have been loving and learning. I could sit and stare at him all day long!"
The couple had managed to keep the news private throughout Laura's pregnancy and surprised many when they finally revealed their baby joy.
The post received floods of messages from well-wishers, with rugby stars Jordi Murphy, Sean O'Brien and Jimmy Gopperth congratulating the couple.
The couple tied the knot in June 2019 at St Joseph's Church in Clifden, Co Galway, after Cian popped the question in December 2017.
Split
The pair first started dating in school, but a move to New York for Laura meant that the couple split in 2012. However, they reunited three years later on her return to Ireland.
Leinster star Healy dated former Miss Ireland Holly Carpenter but that relationship ended back in 2014.

Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has rowed back on expectations that everyone in the country will be vaccinated by September.
Mr Donnelly had said the Government is planning its vaccine programme around a supply of vaccines that "would mean every citizen can be vaccinated by September".
However, speaking in the Dáil yesterday, he said this roll-out was "heavily caveated" on supply of the vaccines.
There has been disruption in supplies with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and now doubts have been cast on the delivery of AstraZeneca doses.
The minister previously promised 700,000 people would be vaccinated by the end of March.
"The figure of 700,000 was in an effort to provide an indicative target for the Oireachtas," Mr Donnelly said.
Conditional
The latest figures show that 147,700 Covid-19 first doses have been administered, and 13,800 people have received their second dose. Under the plans, vaccination of over-70s will start next month.
"The figure of 700,000 was conditional on supply coming in, including from AstraZeneca, and as we're all aware, AstraZeneca have signalled that they will be not delivering the full amount that was anticipated," Mr Donnelly said.
Meanwhile, the Joint Committee on Health will today receive an update from the High-Level Taskforce on Covid-19 vaccination at a meeting in Leinster House.
Chairman of the Committee Deputy Seán Crowe said: "Vaccines offer hope, for an end to lockdown and hopefully one day an end to this pandemic which has now bereaved more than 3,000 families and caused ill-health, fear and disruption for so many across the State."
He said people want to know the exact details of when the vaccine will be available to them and their loved ones.

High-fliers shun one-bed flats over lack of work space

One-bedroom apartments have become a no-go for Dublin Dockland dwellers with renters avoiding them in their droves during the work-from-home rules.
The exodus of workers from the high-rent hub during the pandemic led to a fall in residential rents that could continue during 2021 as uncertainty continues over reopening dates for large employers.
Average rents dropped 13pc since last March as workers were sent home, with high-end apartments falling further, but the fall was greatest for one-bedroom apartments.
Owen Reilly, an estate agent specialising in the area, said couples were shunning smaller apartments as there was no space for them to work.
His highest-earning tenants weren't just looking for an extra bedroom but wanted an escape from the Docklands completely to somewhere they could have a garden.
Between March and April last year, just weeks into the first lockdown, 10pc of Mr Reilly's tenants ended their tenancy prematurely and left the area.
He said the majority were from abroad and left Ireland completely to work from their home country, mainly in continental Europe.
That response, and the almost complete collapse of the short-term rental market, has caused a shake-up and it is not yet clear when things will begin to stabilise again.
There was no lack of interest among renters in the area, however, as many saw an opportunity to live in a location previously too expensive.
It is still not a bargain location. Properties rented through Mr Reilly's agency cost on average €2,312 a month, just 7pc below 2019.
The expansion of companies such as Amazon, TikTok and Salesforce drove interest in the area too.
Demand also surged in the last few months of the year with workers preparing to come back to the office in the new year, although the fresh lockdown has postponed the return for many.
Mr Reilly said, however, that landlords would have to be aware that the market was more competitive and consider inducements to attract tenants, at least until the large-scale return to offices begins.
While the rental market has been bumpy, the sales market remained quite solid although the composition of buyers changed significantly.
First-time buyers made up 57pc of all buyers during the year while investor buyers fell from 47pc to 26pc.
In March and April, close to 60pc of Mr Reilly's sales fell through, almost all of them because investors pulled out.
Workforce
Another indicator that the balance between investor and owner-occupier shifted is that 57pc of his buyers required a mortgage, an increase of 26pc on 2019.
First-timers pushed prices for properties in the under-€400,000 category up 2pc while prices in the €500,000-€700,000 category fell 4pc. Beyond that, Mr Reilly had only a handful of transactions.
The appetite to buy remains strong, as indicated by the fact that selling prices in the second half of 2020 were on average 3.3pc above asking price.
Docklands was preparing for an explosion in activity prior to Covid with the workforce expected to double within a few years.
Mr Reilly said he expected those factors would still remain influences in the area.

Moving to a Zero-Covid island not possible, Nphet chief insists

The idea of transforming Ireland into a 'Zero-Covid' island is based on an "utterly false promise" that carries huge risks, Professor Philip Nolan said last night.
Prof Nolan, of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), was speaking as the proposal to eliminate the country of Covid-19 to allow the nation to return to normal is gaining ground among some Opposition politicians.
"I think it is an utterly false promise to say we can put certain things in place and go back to Level 0 or 1 in weeks or months," he insisted.
He said no system could guarantee the exclusion of a new disease or variant and Ireland would remain a "leaky country" vulnerable to both threats.
The aim now is to drive down community transmission of the virus here as much as possible, which will allow for "strategic options" to be taken as Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out further.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan also said this country has essential links with Europe, including Northern Ireland, which makes it unrealistic to seal our borders.
He shared the aspiration to get the virus down as far as possible and said many of the measures in place are taking us in the same direction while trying to slow the spread of more infectious forms of the virus.
"We simply could not seal the borders and stop movement of people in and out," he said.
But if the country opened up as normal there was the risk of new variants taking root here and rapidly intensifying, he added.
Earlier Prof Nolan said the spread of the virus is declining rapidly with 1,466 new cases yesterday.
"Incidence is falling and by working collectively to reduce contacts we have achieved suppression of transmission with the R number estimated at 0.4 to 0.7.
"We are maintaining an extraordinary effort but still we have a long way to go.
"We must maintain full suppression for several weeks if we are to achieve strategic options for the future.
"If we keep this up, we would be down to 200-400 cases per day by the end of February."
However, another 47 Covid-19 deaths were reported yesterday.
Dr Holohan said while incidence is falling it remains high.
He said: "We are continuing to experience high mortality with 878 deaths so far in January.
Hospital
"I am concerned about the high incidence we are seeing in long-term care settings and vulnerable groups.
"Our efforts to stay home and break transmission of the disease will save lives. Please continue to follow the public health advice and support each other to keep going."
The numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital fell to 1,567 but the number in intensive care remains high, although stabilised, at 216.
The forecast is that daily case numbers could reduce to 200 to 400 a day at the end of February. At that point, there would be around 600-800 Covid-19 patients in hospital with 60 to 80 in intensive care.
There is concern about what will happen when the country opens up a significant level of activity and fears that vaccinations will trigger a relaxation in anti-Covid rules and this could lead to a sharp rise in infection.
The more infectious UK variant continues to gain dominance here and nine cases of the South African strain had been found which were travel-related. No case of the Brazilian strain has been found.
HSE chief Paul Reid announced yesterday that close contacts of confirmed cases are to be offered tests again from today.
Dr Lorraine Doherty of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre provided examples showing how one event can spark a chain of transmission.
In one case, a person who picked up the virus in a meat plant set off a trail of transmission leading to 220 being infected.
A separate outbreak among third-level students gave rise to 61 linked cases. One student worked as a waitress at a wedding, infecting 16 other staff and guests.

Number of mortgages falls to lowest level in three years

The number of people who drew down a mortgage last year was at its lowest level for three years.
New figures from the Banking and Payments Federation show that just short of 36,000 mortgages were issued last year.
The total approved for a home loan was also at its lowest level since 2017 as the pandemic hit the housing market hard.
Some 35,617 mortgages, to a value of €8.36bn, were drawn down in 2020.
This was the lowest level of activity since 2017, the banking body said.
In 2019, before the pandemic, almost 42,800 mortgages were drawn down.
This means there was a drop of more than 7,000 in the number of mortgages drawn down by first-time buyers, movers, switchers, investors and those topping up their home loan.
The value of the mortgages that were drawn down fell by €1.1bn in 2020 compared with the previous year.
Last year a total of 43,151 buyers were approved for mortgages, down around 6,000 on the 2019 total.
These approval figures do not all turn into mortgage drawdowns as a chronic shortage of properties to buy means many potential borrowers often get outbid and do not end up buying.
The value of the approvals last year was €10.34bn. The number of approvals in 2020 was the lowest since 2017.
However, the value of approvals was up 2.1pc on the 2018 figure, reflecting the rise in the property values.
The average approved mortgage grew by almost 6pc year on year to €244,700.
This is up almost €10,000 on the value of the average approval in December 2019.
Over the last three months of last year some 12,154 new mortgages were issued to borrowers, with a value of €2.95bn.
This number of mortgages was down slightly on the total for the same three-month period in 2019.
A total of 3,999 mortgages were approved in December.
This was down by 23pc compared with the previous month, but up 35pc when compared with the same month in 2019.
Decline
Chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation Brian Hayes said there was strong growth in approvals and drawdowns in December and in the last three months of last year.
However, he added that the recovery in mortgage activity in recent months has not fully offset the sharp decline seen earlier in 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions.
He said the large numbers approved for a mortgage mean there is a good pipeline for drawdowns in the first and second quarter of this year.
"It remains to be seen, however, what the impact the current lockdown we are experiencing will have on prospective homebuyers and the mortgage market as we move beyond that," Mr Hayes pointed out.
Separate figures from the State's Property Price Register show that there were 48,300 residential property transactions last year.
This is compared with 58,791 in 2019.
Last year's transactions had a value of €15.6bn, down from €18.6bn in 2019.
Economist at Davy Stockbrokers Conall Mac Coille said demand from homebuyers has been robust.
It has been held back only by limited stock, he explained, with new homes listed for sale now down to a fresh low of 12,200.

Roll-out of Oxford jab to older age groups hinges on crucial decision by European watchdog today

The planned roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine to older people here risks a hold-up if the long-awaited Oxford/AstraZeneca jab is not recommended to be given to people older than 65.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is today expected to decide the terms on which the vaccine will be licensed.
It could err on the side of caution given that only 5.7pc people involved in trials of the vaccine were over 65.
Germany took the lead yesterday in advance of approval and said the vaccine would only be given to people aged between 18 and 64.
Sources say the EMA may not make a specific recommendation, but would leave it up to EU member states to decide on whether to give it to older groups.
HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said the HSE would await the EMA decision, which would be analysed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee here.
The current plan here is to start giving it to over-85s first, in mid-February.
If it is not to be given to older age groups, it would mean a longer wait for vaccination by the over-70s, who will be dependent on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
It comes amid the ongoing row between AstraZeneca and the European Commission over the drug company's failure to deliver on the 81 million doses of the vaccine expected in the first quarter.
Promised
Ireland was promised 600,000 doses in the first quarter, but has been told to expect around 300,000.
HSE chief Paul Reid said yesterday that up to Sunday, 148,500 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine had been administered. This rose to 161,500 on Wednesday.
They include 71,600 first doses in long-term care facilities and 89,000 doses among frontline health workers. Of these, 76,100 have got a first dose and 13,000 have got the second dose.
In the coming week 46,000 second doses will be administered.
Four nursing homes are still without vaccinations due to outbreaks and it remains incomplete in 117 facilities.
If the EMA decides not to recommend the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for older people, it will mean supplies delivered here will have to be diverted from the over-70s to other cohorts.
It could mean that other outstanding residents and staff in residential care will get it sooner. There is also the possibility the HSE will move down to the key workers group while waiting for enough supplies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to come through for the over-70s.
There are around 500,000 people here aged over 70.
Within the older cohort in trials of the vaccine, one of 341 vaccinated people and one in a control group of 319 people without the vaccine became infected with the coronavirus, making a statistically reliable conclusion impossible.
AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said the company had less data than other drugmakers on the elderly because it started vaccinating older people later.
"But we have strong data showing very strong antibody production against the virus in the elderly, " he told Die Welt newspaper.

Staying at home sees emissions fall by 17pc

Staying at home prevented two million tonnes of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere last year as motorists inadvertently did their bit for climate action.
Transport emissions fell by 17pc because of Covid travel restrictions, proving a permanent change in commuting habits could have a significant role in cutting carbon.
Covid drove other emissions up, however, sparking a 9pc rise from the residential sector as people worked and studied, or were left unemployed, at home with lights and heating on for longer than normal.
Emissions from the energy industry fell by 14pc but this had little to do with the pandemic and was a result of the move away from coal and peat in electricity generation to renewable energy instead.
Rebound
A slight rise in agricultural emissions is expected as a result of increased fuel and fertiliser use.
The figures, from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, are estimates to be verified later this year but usually have a high degree of accuracy.
Overall they amount to a fall in emissions of 6pc, close to the 7pc annual average to which the Government has committed.
However, EPA director general Laura Burke said the post-Covid economic rebound would push emissions back up.
"While these early estimates show a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 as a result of Covid restrictions, this level of emission reductions, at a minimum, will be required annually," she said.
Climate Action Minister Eamon Ryan said the figures showed the scale of the changes required to the way the population lived if emissions were to be reduced.
"Just doing less than business-as-usual will not be enough, we must make fundamental changes to how we live our lives," he said.

'I will smash his teeth out' - mobster's threat to 'evil piece of poison' Kinahan

Liverpool gangster Darren Gee has turned on mob boss Daniel Kinahan and called him out on social media - describing him as an "evil piece of poison".
Gee, who was jailed for 18 years for his part in the murder of David Reagan, claimed last year that a friend was shot and injured by a bullet meant for him.
He said he now knows who sent the gunman and has accused the Irish mafia boss of being behind the alleged hit and sending a "crack head" from Liverpool to shoot him.
Gee (41) is a notorious gangster and was part of the infamous Scouser gang wars in 2004 and since his release has been threatened a number of times.
Last year he told the Liverpool Echo: "We were getting in a taxi...My friend headed out first and then we heard shooting in the street.
"I tried to chase the lads on a bike but lost them.
"The bullets were meant for me.
"When they realised they hit the wrong person, they stopped shooting."
Merseyside police issued him with a number of threat-to-life warnings but months ago he broke cover to appear on the hit podcast show Anything Goes.
He conducted a lengthy interview with podcaster James English about his life of crime and spoke about his brushes with death and his desire to go straight and help others "chose a life, not a knife."
The interview was watched by more than one million viewers and helped put the presenter English on the map.
English later interviewed one-eyed gangster Marvin Herbert, who once worked as a coach at Kinahan's MGM gym in Spain.
He described his long career in the underworld and admitted working as an enforcer in the UK and on the Costa.
However in recent weeks Gee has fallen out with English and accused him of getting too close to Herbert and other boxers linked to Kinahan's former gym, which is now called MTK.
Gee claimed he had made English famous and said he wanted to make his own show while Herbert also tried his hand at interviewing people resulting in social media callouts dubbed the 'podcast wars.'
English made his own video but later removed it after seeking an apology from Gee and saying he had hit the big time before he had the gangster on his show.
Gee has been recording a string of videos claiming "the Irish" are responsible for a number of shootings in Liverpool over the last few years, including an attempt on his own life.
He has claimed that Marvin Herbert is a representative of Daniel Kinahan and says they are trying to muscle in on popular podcasting.
Last week Gee posted and later removed a video featuring a picture of Kinahan in his black and gold MGM gear.
Disgusting
The boxing club changed name to MTK after Kinahan claimed to have sold his interest in the company after the 2016 Regency Hotel attack at a boxing weigh in.
"That disgusting piece of ****," he said.
"That's Daniel Kinahan, the dude that changed MGM gyms to MTK gyms because of violence in Ireland.
"I will smash his teeth out on sight.
"I would break every bone in his face with me fists."
And he continued: "Daniel Kinahan; I will punch your head in.
"You're a big hard man with money to do what you want.
"Get yourself to me and we will get it on.
"You don't represent any Irish man."
Merseyside police are keeping an eye on the situation as it develops.

790 drove drunk or on drugs over Christmas

Gardaí arrested 790 motorists for driving under the influence as part of their Christmas and New Year road safety campaign.
The campaign, which ran from December 4 to January 5, focused on detecting whether motorists had taken alcohol or drugs.
Over the course of the operation, officers carried out 12,858 breath tests and manned 5,513 checkpoints.
Gardaí said despite reduced traffic for certain periods over Christmas, the numbers detected for driving under the influence has remained high.
There were 10 deaths on the roads during the period, down six when compared with the same dates in 2019.
Enforcement
Last year, there were 148 deaths on Irish roads, an increase of 6pc in comparison with the 140 over the same period the year before.
Another key part of the campaign was National Slow Down Day, which took place on December 11 and 12.
The operation comprised high-visibility speed enforcement across the 1,300 speed enforcement zones, as well as the delivery of a road safety message through national, local and social media.
Overall, gardaí and GoSafe checked 186,125 vehicles and found 892 travelling over the speed limit.
A total of 85,233 drivers were found to be driving within the limit.
Gardaí issued 1,096 Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs) for use of mobile phones, while 314 FCNs were issued over seatbelt use.
Assistant Commissioner Paula Hilman, of the Roads Policing and Community Engagement Bureau, appealed to road users to remember the basics of road safety.
"The message is clear - never drive if you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or a combination of both," she said.
"We also ask that drivers increase their compliance with speed limits in order to lower speed-related collisions. This will reduce injuries on our roads and save lives."

A woman working in north Dublin was this month's winner of the Lord Mayor's Award for her mask fundraiser.
Ann McDonnell, who works in the Spar store on Glasnevin Avenue in Finglas, was chosen by Lord Mayor Hazel Chu after being nominated by a local customer, Colette Finnegan.
Ann started to sew her masks once the pandemic began and sold them in the Spar, sending all the proceeds to St Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown.
Delighted
She was overwhelmed to have won the award and said she could not believe it.
"People are saying I'm great, but it's the customers, really," she said.
"We've raised €8,000 for the hospice so far and we're still selling the masks. We have a great community.
"Before I worked in the shop I was a machinist at home when the kids were younger, so it's like I've gone back to my roots.
"I'll be bringing the award to bed with me tonight, I'm absolutely delighted."
The Lord Mayor had kind words to say about Ann, and also noted that many worthy people were nominated again this month.
"We really do have so many good people in this city," she said.
"I went with Ann as this month's winner because not only does she sound like a ray of sunshine for customers coming into the shop, she has also put another of her talents to great use making masks and raising money for a super cause. Well done."
Lovely
Customer Colette also commended her on her initiative, saying: "I think Ann is a great woman, and she always has a lovely greeting for everyone who enters the shop.
"Well done Ann for raising all that money for such a great cause and for thinking of everyone and keeping them safe with your lovely masks."

Dealer told gardaí ball of cannabis was a 'legal high'

A convicted drug dealer said he thought a vacuum-packed ball of cannabis found in his bedroom during a garda search was a "legal high".
Mark Dunne (43) said he had bought the €470 worth of "weed" for €80 in a shop because he did not realise it was illegal and it was "so cheap I couldn't say no".
Dublin District Court heard the shop was later investigated, raided and shut down.
Judge Grainne Malone found Dunne guilty of possession of the drug and having it for sale or supply.
She imposed a four-month suspended sentence.
Dunne, a father-of-two, had pleaded not guilty.
The prosecuting garda said he searched the house at Rafter's Avenue, Drimnagh, under a warrant on November 20, 2018 and found cannabis in a tightly-sealed, vacuum-packed plastic bag in the accused's bedroom.
Dunne took responsibility at the scene and said it was for personal use.
Obvious
The garda initially believed it was a small amount because the ball was so tightly packed, but when opened it was obvious it was a larger quantity, 23.5g, valued at €470.
Dunne later told gardaí he bought "that weed" from a CBD shop.
He said he thought it was a legal high, it would take him a month to smoke it and he had not intended to sell or supply it to anyone else.
Asked if it was cannabis, he said: "Yeah, it could be."
He said that when he saw it in the shop, "it was so cheap I couldn't say no".
Defence solicitor Matthew Kenny said it was his client's "honest belief" that what he bought was not a controlled drug.
No tick list or weighing scales were found.
Judge Malone rejected the defence's argument.
She said Dunne's assertions went to his credibility and she could not accept them.
The accused suffered from his nerves and had relied on using cannabis, Mr Kenny said.

Jamie Dornan has been lined up to star in a new BBC thriller from the makers of The Missing and Liar.
Set in the Australian Outback, The Tourist will star the Co Down actor as a man searching for his identity after waking up in hospital with amnesia.
The six-part series is produced by Two Brothers Pictures and was comm- issioned last year by BBC One in association with Stan, the Australian streaming service.
The drama will star Dornan as a British man who finds himself in the Outback being chased by a vast tank truck that is trying to drive him off the road.
He wakes up in hospital with no idea who he is and must search for his missing identity as he is pursued by figures from his past.
Australian actress Danielle Macdonald, who appeared in Lady Bird with Saoirse Ronan, will star as Helen Chambers, a fledgling probationary constable.
Exciting
Line of Duty's Shalom Brune-Franklin will play Luci, a waitress who is swept into the man's journey for answers.
The Lord of the Rings star Hugo Weaving will play Agent Lachlan Rogers, a detective leading the major crime department.
Filming will take place in Australia this year.
The creators promise the series will be "a story of self-discovery with a ticking time bomb underneath".
"The Tourist has some of the most exciting scripts I've ever read," said Dornan.
"I can't wait to go to Australia with such a talented group of people."
Macdonald said: "Helen is a fascinating and intriguing char- acter. I fell in love with her on page one.
"I ended up reading all the episodes in one sitting because I couldn't put them down.
"I'm so excited to get to be a part of this project and I just can't wait to start filming."

A man got into a woman's house and sexually assaulted her while she was asleep in bed after a get-to-know-your-neighbour party.
Anthony Ferguson appeared before Letterkenny Circuit Court in Co Donegal, where he was charged with sexual assault, burglary and threats to damage property.
Ferguson, a 26-year-old supermarket manager, pleaded guilty.
The court was told that Ferguson, with an address at Britannia Point, Colliers Wood, London, was an "outsider" who had arrived at the party on July 21, 2018.
Rowdy
The event, which was organised by locals, involved storytelling and other activities for children.
It also featured a 'baravan', which the court was told is similar to a mobile bar.
That evening, the victim was serving drinks at the baravan when Ferguson became rowdy and was asked to leave as the bar was closing.
The victim and her husband went back to their home nearby with some neighbours and had some more drinks with friends.
However, Ferguson gained entry to the house, was again rowdy and was asked to leave.
The woman and her husband went to sleep at around 2am, but the victim was awoken by a man in the bed who was touching her between her legs.
The man, Ferguson, said to her: "I have you now."
She jumped up, screaming at her husband to get the man out of the house.
Her husband scuffled with him before throwing him out.
Ferguson began shouting to be allowed back in as he had left his phone and jacket inside.
Garda Maria Doherty said they had received a call that a man was banging on doors and that a woman had been sexually assaulted.
Ferguson's barrister, Colm Smyth, said his client was extremely drunk on the night.
The court was told Ferguson has an issue with drugs and alcohol and has undergone two rehabilitation stints in addiction clinics.
Ferguson apologised to his victim, saying he was deeply sorry and ashamed for what he had done.
He added that he was shocked when gardaí said he had sexually assaulted a woman, saying he did not think he was capable of such a thing but could not remember anything from about 9pm that evening.
In a victim impact statement, the woman said she could not work for weeks after the attack and was going around her house locking doors all the time.
Her husband, who works abroad, could not travel as she was afraid to be left alone and they lost a major part of their earnings.
She said Ferguson should accept his wrongdoing and never again put anyone in a position like he had put her in.
Compensation
Mr Smyth said his client's father owned a number of supermarkets and could offer some compensation.
An offer of €20,000 was made, but Mr Smyth stressed that Ferguson would repay all the money back to his father.
Judge John Aylmer said it was appalling what the woman was subjected to on the night.
He noted that Ferguson had no previous convictions.
He said he will review all these circumstances and ad- journed the case until April for a final sentence.

Outbreaks on rise as case numbers 'fail to reflect true level of infection'

The number of Covid-19 outbreaks in private homes and childcare facilities jumped last week as public health officials warned yesterday the daily toll of new cases does not reflect the true level of infection.
New figures show there were 69 outbreaks in private homes last week and another 28 in childcare centres, a rise of 14 in the previous seven days.
Although new daily cases of the virus are falling, people who are close contacts are still not being tested unless they develop symptoms.
People should not "get distracted by the gradual decrease in Covid-19 cases", a statement from the Department of Public Health Mid-West, University of Limerick Hospitals Group and HSE Mid-West Community Healthcare warned.
Dr Mai Mannix, director of Public Health Mid-West, said: "The current trend of decreasing infection levels is a welcome one, and helps our team manage complex clusters and outbreaks when they do arise.
"However, previous experience has shown that where is there is a noticeable drop in cases, there can be a shift in behaviours whereby some members of the public relax their efforts, which then leads to more cases and outbreaks."
The HSE said it needs to see levels of positive cases dropping consistently before reintroducing automatic testing of close contacts.
It comes as another 54 deaths and 1,335 newly diagnosed cases were reported yesterday.
The people who died ranged from 55 to 96 years of age.
The number of patients with Covid-19 in hospital fell to 1,670 from 1,750 the previous day. However, the number of patients in intensive care rose to 217, one higher than on Tuesday.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: "The current 14-day incidence remains more than double the peak incidence experienced during previous Level 5 measures in October.
"Therefore, now is not the time to drop your guard and start to interact with people outside your household.
"The risk of transmission in the community remains very high.
"We must continue to work towards reducing incidence of disease and preventing further hospitalisations and deaths."
One in 76 people tested positive for the virus this month.
There were 20 new outbreaks of the virus in hospitals last week, 27 in long-term care facilities and 31 in residential institutions.
Another 36 were reported in workplaces, including 11 in food production and 10 in the commercial sector.
Offices suffered six outbreaks and two were in ­construction sites.
Care
Meanwhile, a report from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (Tilda) at Trinity College, following a survey of almost 4,000 people aged over 60, found their lives have been severely affected by the ­pandemic.
Almost one-third delayed or did not get the medical care they needed.
Their prevalence of Covid-19 was 5pc, but this was three times higher among the 60- to 69-year-olds compared with the over-70s.
Six in 10 have not travelled to meet their family and 80pc are not visiting friends.
More than one in five suffer from depression, double the rate before the pandemic.
Around 22pc are not getting enough physical activity.

There's little sign of holiday spirit at eerily quiet Dublin Airport

RTÉ footage of tanned holiday-makers landing back into Dublin Airport at the height of Level 5 lockdown restrictions may have sparked outrage on social media this week.
But yesterday the airport resembled the Mary Celeste and there was little sign of joviality among the passengers.
Those who were making their way through Dublin Airport were mainly lone travellers, heads down and face masks evident, as they moved quickly through the terminal buildings.
Understandably very few were willing to talk about where they were going or the country they had come from and their reasons for travelling here.
There were very few queues for any of the departing flights and a straight walk through to security.
There was an eerie quiet in the terminal buildings, which are devoid of the usual excited chatter of people reuniting or gangs of pals heading off on a fun-filled weekend away.
Once a thriving, economic hub for this country, it's hard to believe that the north Dublin airport handled 32.9 million passengers in 2019.
One woman who was travelling with her four- and six-year-old daughters explained she was flying to Spain for essential purposes, to meet their father as he was over there working.
She said she chose to fly with Iberia as unlike other airlines they didn't serve food on the plane and that made her feel safer during the trip.
On the way into Terminal 1, gardaí have set up a checkpoint and were stopping every vehicle on the road.
Sombre
At one point, a double-decker Expressway from Letterkenny arrived at the terminal carrying just two passengers and the driver was stopped for a quick chat with gardaí.
The mood was sombre and it felt like nobody really wanted to be there.
Siobhán O'Donnell of the Dublin Airport Authority said it was hard to see a once-vibrant business utterly wiped out with a 94pc drop in passenger numbers.
"I'm there 37 years this year and it's hard to get your head around it," she said.
As for the Prime Time segment, she said anecdotal evidence suggested those travelling for non-essential purposes were "quite sporadic" which is borne out in the figures themselves.

Vaccination rate in UK four times that of Ireland's as fears over shortages grow

The rate of Covid-19 vaccination in the UK is now nearly four times higher than in Ireland, amid fears a shortage of supplies from Oxford AstraZeneca will slow down the roll-out to the over-70s here.
It comes amid the bitter row between the European Commission and AstraZeneca and demands that 75 million jabs be diverted from the UK for member states.
The EU is expected to receive only 31 million doses in the first quarter, around 60pc less than initially agreed, with knock-on shortages for Ireland.
Promised
The latest data shows the doses administered in the UK per 100 people stood at 10.79 yesterday, with 7.3 million vaccines given.
The Republic of Ireland is fourth in the table after the UK, Malta and Denmark. The number of doses given here per 100 people was 2.9.
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said around 300,000 doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine are promised in February and March - down from the expected 600,000 - but he hopes that can improve.
The plan is to start the roll-out of the vaccine - due to be approved tomorrow by the European Medicines Agency - in the middle of next month in GP surgeries and vaccination centres, starting with over-85s.
But there are still questions about whether the EMA will authorise it for older age groups.
Residents over 65 in nursing homes and other residential centres, as well as staff and frontline health workers, will be given the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.
It could be the middle of March before all frontline healthcare workers get a second dose.
AstraZeneca chief Pascal Soriot said his contract with the UK meant that doses coming from its factories would go to Britain first.
He insisted the EU contract did not commit the company to a specific timetable for deliveries.
The vaccines meant for the EU were produced in four plants in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy.
But Stella Kyriakides, the EU's health commissioner, said: "We reject the logic of first come, first served. That may work at the neighbourhood butchers, but not in contracts.
United
"Let me be crystal clear: the 27 European Union member states are united that AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments in our agreement.
"We are in a pandemic. We lose people every day.
"These are not numbers. They are not statistics. These are persons, with families, with friends and colleagues.
"Pharmaceutical companies, vaccine developers, have moral, societal and contractual responsibilities which they need to uphold."

Woman who let heroin be kept in her home avoids jail

A woman who allowed her home to be used to store drugs has avoided a jail term.
Veronica O'Connor (41) was not present when the place was raided by gardaí, although two individuals who did not live in the house were there.
O'Connor, of Bunratty Road, Coolock, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to permitting the sale of controlled drugs from her address on February 22, 2017.
She has two convictions for road traffic offences.
Sergeant Janice Gray told the prosecution that on the date in question, gardaí obtained a search warrant for O'Connor's address on foot of confidential information.
The door to the house was barred when they arrived.
Sgt Gray said that when the door was opened, they found two people in the house who did not live there.
O'Connor was found in a car outside the house and had been talking with her brother, having received bags of clothes from him.
Gardaí found heroin worth €2,412 in the kitchen inside a container that would normally contain tea.
They also found 48 diazepam tablets for which the accused took responsibility.
Detox
The prosecution told the court the State's case was that O'Connor was knowingly allowing people to use her home for the supply of heroin.
He said she gave no names as to who these people were, and the State is "not going so far to say" that it was the two people who were in the house when gardaí arrived.
Sgt Gray agreed with the defence that at least one of them would be known to gardaí and is now serving a "fairly lengthy" sentence for a drugs offence.
The sergeant agreed that his client was on methadone, had relapsed back into tak- ing heroin and was trying to detox.
She agreed his client has had a long addiction, but has managed to get "clean" on several occasions.
Judge Martin Nolan said the accused was a woman of a certain age "who should have known better".
He said that while the amount of drugs involved was "serious enough", it was not "too serious" in relation to the amounts that come before the courts.
Judge Nolan said he did not think she deserved a custodial term.
He sentenced O'Connor to two years' imprisonment, but suspended the entirety on condition that she keep the peace and be of good behaviour for two years.

'Covid lockdown turned me into an overweight trainer'

A fitness coach who piled on the pounds during lockdown has told of her battle to regain control of her weight as the stress of the pandemic 'destroyed' her.
Sharon Doherty revealed she saw herself with the added pounds in a video teaching a private group and felt embarrassed.
The popular gym owner from Ashbourne, Co Meath, has battled depression and anxiety in the past and had previously lost five stone in weight.
As the country continues to deal with an extended period of lockdown, the 43-year-old advises anyone who is feeling down to get help.
She said that as a trainer, coach, nutritionist and gym owner, she felt that she was expected by others to have everything under control.
But she admits that with businesses shutting down and repeated lockdowns, "Covid destroyed me".
"It affected everyone in so many ways and I was in a very bad place for a few months.
"I got into a deep, deep hole. I introduced some old habits and got myself in a bit of a rut with stress and binge eating.
"I saw a video in my private group of myself and it broke me. I felt so embarrassed, ashamed, disgusted that I had let myself get to these extremes. That feeling crippled me and knocked me for 10.
"My body was surviving on stress and it was bloated, swollen, a mixture of excess body fat and water retention and there are actually no words to describe how I felt.
"I had the knowledge under my belt to avoid this and battle it but I didn't have the strength."
She said she finally began to reclaim her life in September when she asked a coach and colleague Paul Morgan to help her to start making small changes.
"I felt so vulnerable. It's not what people expect from a trainer. I was afraid of being judged because who wants a personal trainer who is overweight? Paul worked with me while I worked on me.
Lost
"I was accountable every week with weigh-ins and although normally I don't advise using scales, just seeing the numbers go down gave me hope. I wasn't a blob anymore.
"I had totally lost myself but now I was back.
"The reopening of the gym for a short while motivated me.
"When I'm teaching 20 women going through the same as me, I get inspired by them."
However with gyms closed again, Sharon says that people can still feel positive benefits by aiming to take control of their fitness and diet themselves.
"A little bit of accountability means a lot.
"No matter where you are at the minute with your fitness or nutrition or with your mindset, remind yourself there are many more people in the same boat."

TV presenter Angela Scanlon has said gardening can be a remedy for the "madness going on outside" during the pandemic.
Scanlon (37) said she felt "so grateful" she had a small outdoor space to spend time with her family and sometimes eat dinner.
The TV star, who has a daughter with her eco-entrepreneur husband Roy Horgan, hosts Your Garden Made Perfect on BBC Two, which uses virtual reality technology to show homeowners the true potential of their gardens.
"When you're not allowed to leave, it's like there's a real sense of peace and escape and sanctuary that a garden offers and comfort," she said.
"So, yes, there's a lot of amazing design that's going to bend your mind.
"To be able to look out into a garden and over the course of a year to see a change literally in front of your eyes and know that actually, it goes on, no matter what's happening.
Pool
"We have a small garden and, honestly, I felt every day so, so grateful for it.
"Just to be able to open the door and go out and sit there and have the paddling pool out when it was hot.
"The value, the benefit to your head and soul is amazing, so I will never be taking that for granted again. It's this little oasis of calm."

Vials of Covid-19 vaccine that were delivered to a nursing home have had to be discarded after they were incorrectly stored, HSE bosses have  confirmed.
The 22 vials - which contain around six doses each, enough to give 132 people a first or second dose - were incorrectly stored as they were not kept at the right temperature as per the maker's instructions.
The affected nursing home is part of the Midlands Louth Meath Community Healthcare Organisation.
"Unfortunately, the vials cannot now be used," said a spokeswoman.
The HSE said it was disappointing for all concerned, residents and staff.
"We are sorry that this incident has taken place.
"However, 49 residents and staff were successfully vaccinated at the facility.
"The Community Healthcare Organisation will now work with national colleagues to undertake the remaining vaccinations at the LTRC facility as soon as possible.
Upsetting
"We are very conscious that this is upsetting news for families, residents and staff members who are working hard to protect residents from Covid-19.
"We are offering a range of supports to all concerned.
"The breach has been reported and all necessary processes will be followed," a statement added.
There is published guidance on the use of the vaccine which outlines the medicines management responsibilities at local level, and to provide supporting guidance and resources.
It covers safe storage and distribution, including cold temperature controlled storage, safe handling, stock control, and stock reconciliation.
It also includes oversight of vaccine handling and preparation, including management of shelf life reduction processes following reconstitution.

Broadband is worse since pandemic started for one in four - ComReg report

A quarter of Irish people say their broadband has become worse since the start of the pandemic, according to Comreg.
More than one in seven say their mobile signal has deteriorated since last March.
The figures, taken from a survey of 1,000 people, also show three-quarters of us now rely on home broadband far more than before the pandemic, with families particularly dependent on it to get through an ordinary day.
However, 13pc of Irish home broadband connections are not adequate for home working, Comreg says.
Streaming
The situation is particularly bad for those with mobile broadband services, where one in four say the connection is not good enough to use for home working.
Comreg's survey says just under three in five of us are working from home to some degree.
More than two in five now need broadband to video conference with work colleagues, while three in five use it to watch video streaming services.
Online shopping has almost doubled since April, with half of us now doing so, but video calling friends (down 5pc to 57pc) has declined, as has reading the news online (down 5pc to 58pc).
Voice calls on mobile phones have improved, with 14pc saying calls have improved since last March, compared with 10pc saying it has become worse.
Nearly three in five would spend more on broadband to get a better service.
This is much more likely to be the case for households with children (64pc) than those without (51pc).
Those under the age of 35 are also three times as likely to want faster broadband.
Overall, six out of 10 people say their broadband is about the same as at the start of the pandemic, with one in four saying it is worse and one in seven saying it is better.
Virgin Media said this week that its customers used 84pc more broadband data than they did last February.
Last week, the National Broadband Plan connected its first rural home under the €3bn scheme.
The first households and businesses to be connected to fibre broadband are in Cork and Cavan, through commercial operators such as Eir, Sky and Vodafone.
Homes in Limerick and Galway are to follow in the coming weeks, with 19,000 due by the end of April and 130,000 due by the end of the year.
National Broadband Ireland says it has operations under way in all 26 counties and expects the number of premises under construction to be in excess of 130,000 by the end of the year, with around 70,000 premises available for connection "at prices similar to those available in urban areas".
Cheaper
The new service will typically cost from €45 a month for a 500Mbs connection or from €55 for a 1,000Mbs connection.
This is cheaper than similar services in cities, most of which are limited to a single high-speed provider, Virgin Media. It charges €71 a month for a 500Mbs connection after an introductory six-month discount period.
Roll-out plans for other areas of the country can be checked at nbi.ie/rollout-plan.
However, a timeline for any acceleration in the roll-out remains unclear.
As it stands, it is not due to be completely finished before 2027.

Kenny says he'll take a fine-tooth comb to new proposal for nursing home next to his house in Dalkey

Broadcaster Pat Kenny has said he is "taken aback by the scale, bulk and size" of a five-storey, 104-bedroom nursing home proposed for lands beside his home in Dalkey.
The Newstalk presenter was commenting on plans by Richard Barrett's Bartra Capital for the planned Yonder nursing facility.
The application comes 18 months after Bartra secured the go-ahead for 18 apartments and six houses on the 1.4-acre Yonder site.
Bartra only obtained planning permission from An Bord Pleanála after a battle with local residents, including Kenny and his wife Cathy, over the apartment scheme.
The nursing home plan replaces the apartments proposal for the site.
Surprised
"I was surprised to see this new application and taken aback by the scale, bulk and size of such an enterprise in an infill site in a residential area," Kenny said.
The proposed nursing home rises from two to five storeys.
Mr Kenny said that at five storeys in places, the scheme is one storey higher than the original apartment plan proposal.
He said the planned development site is surrounded by 10 householders' back gardens, and added that what is planned "is effectively a commercial enterprise" and "the equivalent of dropping a 104-bedroom hospital" into a residential area.
He said he will now go through the application "with a fine-tooth comb".
"I want to look at the detail to see all the difficulties that were presented in the original apartment scheme application and see if there has been any attempt to resolve those," he said.
He added that he is "certain" he will be lodging a submission with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on the plan.
"The nature of that observation will depend on the nature of the application. There are so many issues with this plan," he said.
Documents lodged with the planning application contend the scheme will have a significantly reduced impact on the Kenny home and neighbouring properties than the permitted apartment scheme.
In the documents lodged by Thornton O'Connor Town Planning, Patricia Thornton states that, unlike the permitted scheme, there is no development in the southern portion of the site and this significantly reduces the impact on the surrounding dwellings.
She said the nursing home has been designed to minimise the potential impact on surrounding properties.
She added that the scheme's location close to Dalkey village and the local Dart station will ensure future residents have the opportunity to remain living within their community.
Benefit
Ms Thornton said future residents will be provided with medical care and support while also enjoying the benefit of existing social and community infrastructure.
She contended that what is proposed represents a significant investment in an under-utilised infill site providing "a much needed nursing home facility for the area".
The principal objective is to contribute towards reducing the shortage of residential care home beds, she said.
A decision is due on the application in March, and if Bartra is unsuccessful it can proceed with its apartments plan for the site.

New penalties for breaking travel rules 'far too weak'

Cabinet ministers fear a public backlash over new mandatory quarantine plans which they believe do not go far enough to stop the spread of the virus from overseas.
The new quarantine rules will only apply to anyone travelling from South Africa and Brazil, along with those who arrive in Ireland without a negative Covid-19 test.
All other passengers are to be subject to mandatory quarantine in their homes, while a new €500 fine for taking any non-essential travel is to be introduced.
However, during a more than four-hour Cabinet meeting, ministers raised concerns the quarantine proposals will not go far enough to stop the spread of the virus or appease public demand for tighter controls on our borders once the spread of the disease is brought under control
At the meeting, Culture Minister Catherine Martin and Higher Education Minister Simon Harris both called for stronger regulations than those proposed by the Cabinet Committee on Covid-19.
Ms Martin, the Green Party deputy leader, told the meeting she did not believe the quarantine rules were strong enough to deal with the possibility of more variants of the virus emerging.
She said a larger managed isolation regime was needed and suggested life would return to near normal by the summer if it was introduced.
Mr Harris also said the new rules did not go far enough and called for more clarity on how the proposed quarantine regulations will work in practice.
Chief Whip Jack Chambers and Education Minister Norma Foley also pushed for tighter restrictions on travellers who are to be legally ordered to quarantine in their homes.
Mr Chambers insisted people should be told to remain in their homes for the two weeks rather than be instructed to restrict their movements.
He said the messaging on quarantining at home should be strong to ensure compliance.
His call for stricter rules on mandatory quarantining at home was supported by Ms Foley.
Crazy
Questions were also raised at the meeting about how mandatory quarantining at home could be policed.
Ministers also called for the list of essential workers to be narrowed to reduce the amount of people allowed to travel overseas.
Sources at the meeting said the quarantine proposals presented to the gathering needed a lot more work which Health Minister Stephen Donnelly committed to undertake in cooperation with other departments.
"I think we are out of step with the public on this and we should be going further," a source said.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said it was "crazy" to expect that people will quarantine in their homes.
She called for all passengers to be held in quarantine hotels.
Labour Party leader Alan Kelly said the quarantine plans were "half-baked, and will ­confuse the situation more".
"It was a missed opportunity to once and for all set out a strategy to suppress and contain the virus," he said.
"What we needed was a strong message from the Government that it will once and for all act, instead of more short-term responses, and stop-gap ­proposals."
Targets
Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall said there is public support for stronger restrictions and urged the Government to act faster.
Separately, Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien raised concerns at Cabinet about the impact of the continued ban on non-essential construction.
He told the meeting for every week of the lockdown between 700 and 800 houses will not be built.
He said the nine weeks of lockdown this year mean his housing targets will be off by between 6,500 and 7,000 homes.
The minister made a submission to the Cabinet Committee on Covid-19 over the weekend seeking to have the ban lifted.
However, it was decided to extend the ban until March 5. The proposals on international travel agreed by the Cabinet included a commitment to increase the fines for breaches of the rules.
The Taoiseach said the fines will be €500.
The Government said there will be increased Garda checks and enforcement activity on people making non-essential journeys during Level 5 restrictions.
Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said under new rules being considered gardaí will be able to ask people travelling from the North to the Republic to turn back if their journey is not deemed essential.
Regulations for some of the new rules will be signed this week but new legislation will have to be drafted for other elements of the Government's travel restrictions.

Six cases of the more infectious South African variant found

A further six cases of the more infectious South African variant of the virus have been detected here, it emerged ­yesterday.
Three cases were found earlier this month and were believed to have been contained.
The South African strain - called B.1.351 - is thought to be much more infectious than regular Covid and even more transmissible than the UK strain, which has been blamed for contributing to the third-wave surge.
There is particular concern because it is still uncertain whether the existing vaccines will be effective against it.
Caught
If not, drug manufacturers will need to reformulate the vaccines and everyone vaccinated would need a new jab.
Five people who caught Covid-19 abroad or were infected by someone who travelled here are among those who have died of the disease over the course of the pandemic, as Ireland yesterday reached a grim milestone of 3,066 deaths from the virus.
As the Cabinet gave the go-ahead for tougher restrictions on travel, the death toll breached 3,000.
The over-75s have been worst hit by fatalities and this third wave has seen high levels of infection among this group.
The number of healthcare workers who have died from the virus has risen to 10 after remaining at eight for several months.
It comes as another 90 deaths were reported yesterday among people ranging in age from 48 to 99 years old.
The number of newly diagnosed daily cases fell below 1,000 to 928 for the first time since Christmas Eve.
Hospitals continue to be under huge pressure, although the number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients fell to 1,750 from 1,905 on Monday.
Intensive care for patients relied heavily on surge beds, with 216 needing the highest level of treatment - a slight drop from 219 on Monday.
"Today we are reporting a further 90 deaths, bringing our cumulative total of lives lost to Covid-19 to more than 3,000 in Ireland," chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said.
"This highly infectious disease is having a severe impact on the most vulnerable in our society and we must continue the good work we are doing.
"The decline in daily incidence of Covid-19 has begun. However, the volume of disease in our communities remains very high.
"To date we have reported 96,000 cases in January 2021, which has already passed the total of 93,500 cases reported in 2020.
Identified
"Indeed, public health doctors in the midlands reported a total of 4,000 cases in the first eight months of 2020 and another 4,000 cases in the first four weeks of 2021.
"Through our enhanced public health surveillance programme we have identified six additional cases linked to the Southern African variant of concern. All cases are being followed up by public health teams in line with the latest European Centre for Disease Control guidance.
"The downturn in incidence has been achieved through the determination of people to stay at home, to work from home and to avoid meeting and socialising with others.
"It is imperative that everyone continues to strictly adhere to the public health advice to protect ourselves and our loved ones."

State 'too slow to bring in laws to protect the environment' - judge

A senior judge has said Ireland had an "astonishing reluctance" to comply with EU environmental laws.
Judge Anthony Collins also said Ireland needed to improve access to the courts for activists and remove key barriers on legal costs.
His comments come as the Government is considering making it harder to bring legal challenges.
Judge Collins sits at the European Court of Justice, where Ireland has been summoned repeatedly for breaches of environmental legislation.
The former Dublin-based barrister has previously represented the State in environmental court cases and he lectures on the subject at University College Cork - for which he recorded a podcast.
He said he made his comments in a personal capacity but did not believe he was revealing secrets about official attitudes to green laws.
Judge Collins said Ireland would have had no effective environmental laws if the EU had not brought them in.
Even when EU directives became European law officially then Ireland fought against implementing them.
A prime early example was the failure to address illegal dumps, which the State argued for years was down to the actions of individuals.
Other examples included the State's failure to apply and enforce laws on septic tanks, habitats, pollutants such as nitrates and phosphates, urban wastewater as well as environmental assessments.
Astonishing
"The list of non-compliance by Ireland of its environmental law obligations at EU level is incredibly long," Judge Collins said.
He added Ireland seemed to pay attention only when taken to court by the European Commission and fined, as in the Derrybrien wind farm case in Co Galway where €8m in penalties has been paid and fines of €15,000 a day are still totting up.
"It was only at that stage that the law was being taken seriously by the State," he said.
"I think it's fair to say there would have been a certain reluctance towards the idea of even applying some of these rules on the part of the State.
"That's fairly evident from the defences that were put forward - an astonishing reluctance to comply with rules which the State signed up to.
"The State willingly went along with all of them and yet when it came to implementing and applying them dragged its heels."
He said citizens had been left to become "private law enforcers", going to court to make the State apply the laws "often at considerable risk to their own financial safety".
"Access to justice is a major issue in Ireland," he said.
He said the bar was low for a court in deciding whether to allow legal challenges to the State but it could be raised.
However once an applicant met that threshold then they should be indemnified against paying costs if they lost, he said in the podcast.
Environment Minister Eamon Ryan accepted Ireland's record had been poor.
But he said the Government was working hard on issues such as climate, air quality, water quality and a reduction in waste.

Pharmacy teams 'feel sidelined in jab roll-out'

Pharmacists have complained they have been given no details about told when they will be vaccinated or when they will begin vaccinating the public.
The Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) has complained of being "sidelined" by the Department of Health and the HSE.
The Government announced last week that it had agreed a €91m deal with pharmacists and GPs to administer the vaccines, but so far pharmacists have received no details about their involvement or role, according to IPU chief executive Darragh O'Loughlin.
"We've heard nothing specific about when pharmacy teams will be vaccinated or when pharmacies will be rolling out vaccination to patients and the public," he said.
Eroding
"This is leading to huge frustration and annoyance among pharmacists and staff. Pharmacists feel sidelined by the Department and the HSE and their goodwill is eroding."
Mr O'Loughlin, who believes pharmacists could administer 80,000 vaccines a week, said yesterday that the IPU had been told verbally, without being given a reason, that they would not be involved in the roll-out to the over-70s.
The Department of Health and the HSE, whose officials are due to meet with the IPU today, did not respond to queries last night.

Viagra Connect - a newly branded name for the famous medicine for men suffering from impotence - will be available over the counter in the coming weeks.
Viatris yesterday announced the launch of the medicine to be known as Viagra Connect as a non-prescription, pharmacy-supplied treatment.
Sildenafil, commonly known by its brand name Viagra, was the first oral drug for erectile dysfunction to hit the market in 1998 and has been prescribed for more than 64 million men.
A spokeswoman said the hope is that the availability of Viagra Connect in Irish pharmacies will encourage men to get help for the condition.
Questions
It should facilitate early diagnosis and the management of both erectile dysfunction and underlying cardiovascular conditions.
"In order to purchase the product, men will need to answer some questions about their health so that the pharmacist can determine whether Viagra Connect is suitable for them," the spokeswoman said.

'I'm on dialysis and high risk - so why am I so low on vaccine list?'

When Matthew McNeive went for a check-up in the dialysis unit in Beaumont Hospital last November, a brief conversation with the receptionist made his blood run cold.
He asked her if she was busy, and she replied: "No. We have lost seven patients to Covid."
"It really shocked me," says Matthew (21), from Knock, Co Mayo, who since birth has endured 25 operations, including a kidney transplant in 2010.
Like thousands of renal and transplant patients, Matthew can't understand why his community has been placed seventh in the HSE vaccine priority list.
The Covid-19 mortality rate for renal and transplant patients in Ireland is estimated to be as high as 25pc. Matthew's life now consists of attending hospital for dialysis three times a week.
Despite near-constant hospitalisations as a child, Matthew excelled at school and earned a place at the Technological University Dublin studying clinical measurement science.
Now in third year, he has never repeated a year of his education but due to the HSE vaccine priority policy, the prospect looms large.
"I was due to start placement in Beaumont Hospital last October. However, the HSE deemed I was too high risk due to Covid-19.
"I was told that if I have the vaccine by February 15, I would have the immunity to start my last placement by March 15. However, because of how the distribution of vaccines has been ranked I am number seven on the list which means I won't get it until April.
"I won't be able to go into fourth year with my mates and will have to pay €6,000 in fees. The kicker is that if I was on placement I would have the vaccine by now. My classmates who are on placement have already been vaccinated.
Brilliant
"Dialysis patients are regarded as being extremely high risk in terms of Covid-19 and to put us way down the list seems contradictory.
"My year head, Dr Siobhan Daly, has been brilliant trying to accommodate me, but I think the HSE has prioritised the pecking order for vaccinations wrong.
"Renal patients feel a bit failed by the HSE. We are just as high risk as people in nursing homes, we are actually taking medication to suppress our immune system. It doesn't make sense."

'It means the world to me': restaurant bags its first ever Michelin stamp of approval

Ireland has gained a brand new Michelin star - for Dede in Baltimore in West Cork.
This is where Ahmet Dede, who previously held a star at the now-closed Mews, brings a Turkish sensibility to modern food based on the very best local produce.
"This means the world to me," said Dede, clearly emotional as he spoke to the host of the virtual awards ceremony for the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland 2021, Davina McCall, from Turkey.
No Irish restaurants lost their Michelin stars - even though Derry and Sally Anne Clarke of L'Ecrivain had asked Michelin not to include their restaurant in this year's guide as they have to vacate the building by the end of March.
Aniar in Galway, which was closed for the whole of 2020 bar a couple of days at the start of the year, kept its star - a relief for chef and restaurateur JP McMahon.
Michelin awarded three of its new Green stars - recognising a commitment to sustainable gastronomy - to three restaurants in the west of Ireland: Inis Meáin Restaurant & Suites in the Aran Islands, Kai in Galway's West End, and Loam in Galway city.
Ireland also gained four new Bibs Gourmand, recognising good food at affordable prices. These are Goldie in Cork city, Table Forty One in Gorey, Spitalfields in Dublin city centre, and Volpe Nera in Blackrock, Co Dublin.
Several restaurants including Clanbrassil House and Circa in Dublin, and Two Cooks in Kildare, alongside others which have closed permanently, did not retain their Bibs. This does not necessarily mean a drop in standards, and may be down to pricing.
Ross Lewis of Chapter One, Dublin, for whom Ahmet Dede worked in the early days of his career, received the Chef Mentor award, an accolade welcomed by chefs in Ireland. Speaking from his home in Dublin, he thanked the guide for "a huge honour".
At House at the Cliff House Hotel in Ardmore, Ian Doyle, who took up the position only last spring, retained the star previously held by Martijn Kajuiter.
Digital
"The inspectors decided I hadn't messed things up too badly," Doyle said.
For the first time in its history, the Michelin Guide has gone digital and there will be no printed guide.
Some had questioned whether there was any point publishing a guide when pubs and restaurants have been closed for so many months.
"The answer is simple," said a Michelin spokesperson.
"We want to promote the industry as much as we possibly can. We want to celebrate the many amazing restaurants in Great Britain and Ireland and all the hugely talented chefs and restaurateurs."

Bread will cost more dough due to Brexit

Consumers face a possible 9pc increase in the price of bread, Food and Drink Ireland (FDI) has warned.
The fallout from Brexit will result in tariffs being applied to flour imports and lead to increased costs for the bakery sector, according to the lobby group, which is part of Ibec.
FDI director Paul Kelly said: "Under the Rules of Origin in the TCA [Trade and Cooperation Agreement], there is a requirement that the wheat used should be of UK or EU origin, with a maximum tolerance of 15pc for grain from other countries such as Canada or USA."
If the wheat used to make flour is more than 15pc of third country origin, the full tariff of €172 per tonne becomes payable.
Millers
Mr Kelly said this is "a significant problem" for the bakery industry, which buys flour from millers in Britain with a high proportion of third country wheat, mainly from Canada or the US.
If the full tariff of €172 per tonne were to be applied to flour imported from Britain, it would mean a 50pc increase in product costs, FDI warned.
Based on ERSI projections, which also looked at other non-tariff barriers, this would equate to a 9pc increase in bread for consumers.
The tariffs will have a "significant" impact on the competitiveness of Irish-based producers both on their domestic and export markets, FDI added.
It has called for an exemption for the bakery sector in order to avoid these tariffs.
It said at this point it is hard to know how many companies could be affected and any price increases would be a matter for individual businesses.
Michael McCambridge, of McCambridge Bread, said his business will not be affected as it uses a different type of flour, with a lower protein, to other bakeries. Also, the flour it uses is milled in Ireland.
David Hickey, of Daly Foods, sees a "big increase" coming in the price of flour, but said this is due to the "aggressive" rise in the price of wheat, which was happening before Brexit.

Economy will 'take off like a rocket' after Covid-19 despite soaring job losses and business closures, Varadkar insists

Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said he expects the economy to "take off like a rocket" after the pandemic.
He was speaking as new figures revealed the number of redundancies planned by employers more than doubled last year.
Employers notified the Enterprise Minister of 11,744 redundancies between March and the end of 2020.
This compared with 5,007 proposed job losses that were notified during the same period in 2019.
Under employment legislation, employers proposing collective redundancies must flag them with the minister.
Mr Varadkar said the numbers would have been much higher if the Government had not put an economic rescue package in place.
This included wage subsidy schemes, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), grants, a commercial rates waiver and low-cost loans.
The latest figures show there are more than 475,000 people on the PUP and another 189,860 on the Live Register.
Many of these workers have been laid off because of Government-ordered shutdowns, so have not been registered as potential redundancies.
Thousands of others have had wages propped up by a State subsidy scheme.
"We know last year was a really difficult year," he said.
"Any redundancy is personally devastating for the individual and I know there is a family behind each one of these figures."
He said there will be an increasing focus on education and training opportunities for people who want to change careers, even temporarily.
"I believe the Irish economy will take off like a rocket once the pandemic ends and we will be able to return to low levels of unemployment again within a few years," he said.
Economist Jim Power noted that the redundancy figures are significantly lower than the 470,000-plus people on the PUP, or the 598,000 on the payment at the peak last May.
"I think the redundancy figures obviously show a significant deterioration but the magnitude of that deterioration without PUP and the wage subsidy would have been catastrophic," he said.
"However, it is extremely expensive and listening to the Taoiseach at the weekend, I wouldn't be full of confidence of any turnaround any time soon.
Lucky
"Inevitably in 2021 we will see another significant increase in those redundancy figures.
"Many businesses will decide there is no point going on."
Economist Alan McQuaid said he expects the unemployment rate, which stood at around 4pc before the pandemic, will remain in double digits after subsidies are withdrawn.
"We've done better than we thought," he said.
"We are lucky to have pharma and tech firms but you can't dismiss the fact that the biggest employers are SMEs and they're the ones suffering."
He said the biggest job losses are likely in hospitality and pubs, but construction will be buoyed up by demand.

First steps in Democrats' bid to ensure Trump will never hold office again

The first steps in a historic impeachment of Donald Trump were taken yesterday.
The US House of Representatives formally charged former president Trump with inciting insurrection.
The charge is based on his fiery speech to his followers before this month's deadly attack on the Capitol.
Nine House Democrats who will act as prosecutors walked through the building, carrying the article of impeachment to the Senate where Mr Trump will face trial.
A similar ceremony was carried out for Mr Trump's first impeachment trial last January.
Firsts
It marks two historic firsts - Mr Trump is the only US president to have been impeached by the House twice and will be the first to face trial after leaving office.
The significance of the move is the fact a conviction in the Senate could result in a vote to ban him from future office.
Leaders of the Senate, which is divided 50-50 with Democrats holding a majority because of the tie-breaking vote of Vice-President Kamala Harris, have agreed not to start the trial until February 9.
That gives Mr Trump more time to prepare a defence and allows the chamber to focus on President Joe Biden's early priorities, including Cabinet appointments.
After a two-month campaign to try to discredit his election defeat, Mr Trump on January 6 urged his followers to "fight" to overturn the result. A mob later descended on the Capitol, sending lawmakers into hiding and for several hours delaying Congress' formal certification of Mr Biden's victory.
Ten House Republicans joined Democrats in voting to impeach Mr Trump, a step akin to an indictment in a criminal trial. Senate Democrats will need the support of 17 Republicans to convict him, a steep climb given Mr Trump's continued popularity with Republican voters.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll has found that 51pc of Americans thought the Senate should convict Mr Trump. That largely broke down along party lines, with less than two in 10 Republicans agreeing. Multiple Republicans, including the party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, have condemned the violence and criticised Mr Trump for allegedly inciting it.
Republican Senator Mitt Romney told CNN on Sunday the trial was necessitated by Mr Trump's inflammatory call to his supporters.
"I believe what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offence. If not, what is?" said Mr Romney, a frequent critic of Mr Trump and the only Republican to vote to convict at his first impeachment trial.
But a significant number of Republican lawmakers have raised objections to the impeachment. Senator Marco Rubio pronounced the trial "stupid" and "counterproductive" on Fox News Sunday.
"We already have a flaming fire in this country and it's like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire," Mr Rubio said.
The case is a simpler one than Mr Trump's first impeachment, which focused on a phone call with Ukraine's president that was disclosed by a whistleblower.
In this case, the actions played out in a public speech and a separate phone call to a Georgia election official released to the news media.
Mr Trump was acquitted in his first trial last year, which took nearly three weeks and dealt with charges the president had abused his power and obstructed Congress over his call pressing Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday the second trial would be fairly quick.
Healing
"Everyone wants to put this awful chapter in American history behind us. But sweeping it under the rug will not bring healing," he said.
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Mr Trump who has been helping him build a legal team, urged the Senate to reject the idea of a post-presidency trial - potentially with a vote to dismiss the charge - and suggested Republicans will scrutinise whether Mr Trump's words on January 6 were legally "incitement".
Mr McConnell, who said last week that Mr Trump "provoked" his supporters before the riot, has not said how he will vote.

Income of €100,000 needed for the cheapest Dublin apartments

A joint income of almost €100,000 is now needed just to buy the cheapest new apartment in the Greater Dublin Area.
This is because it is not financially viable for developers to build apartments to sell to ordinary people.
They can only be built to sell if the apartments are constructed in more expensive areas where higher sales prices are achievable, a new report found.
It costs so much to build high-rise accommodation that 76pc of the units analysed were being funded, and would be rented out by so-called cuckoo funds - where investors buy up an entire block of apartments directly from the developer before they hit the open market, pushing first-time buyers out of the market.
The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) said that a first-time buying couple would need a deposit of €38,000 and joint income of €98,000 to buy the lowest-price apartment.
Affordability remains a critical issue, the society said in an analysis of the cost of building apartments in the Greater Dublin Area.
The report found that the sales price of the two-bed apartments reviewed ranges from €375,000 for a low-rise, low-spec unit in the suburbs, to €569,000 for a medium-rise (nine to 15 storeys) high-spec apartment in the city.
This means a first-time buyer couple would need a deposit ranging from €38,000 to €57,000, and a combined salary range of €96,000 to €146,000 to afford these, based on Central Bank lending rules.
A couple both earning €44,000 and with a combined salary of €88,000, and a deposit of €37,500, would not be able to meet the mortgage requirements of the lowest-priced apartment, a low-rise suburban unit priced at €375,000.
Just 20pc of all households enjoy earnings of more than €80,000, according to Central Statistics Office figures.
Funding
The total cost of developing medium-rise apartments now ranges from €411,000 to €581,000, including VAT.
In contrast, last July the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland found the cost of delivering a three-bedroom semi in the Dublin area was €371,000.
Apartment building is so expensive that cuckoo funds are funding their development and then renting them out.
The investment funds have been perceived as pushing first-time buyers out of the market, but others maintain that even fewer apartments would be built without their funding.
The SCSI compared the viability of the traditional apartments that are built to sell with the build-to-rent model involving investment funds.
There are fewer restrictions on build-to-rent schemes relating to the apartment mix, car parking and size, following changes by the Department of Housing in 2016 and updated in 2018.
SCSI chair Paul Mitchell said pension funds and other investment funds which bought these schemes had made a major contribution to apartment supply.
He said it is so expensive to build high rise that only funds could make their development viable.
He said it was so expensive to build apartments that "76pc of the units analysed are for rental rather than sale".

Intensive care cases 'will remain high for weeks'

The number of Covid-19 patients treated in intensive care units will remain very high for weeks to come, although admissions to hospital have now peaked, it has emerged.
People were warned that although the number of new daily cases is falling rapidly the country is in for the long haul as far as restrictions are concerned due to the huge amount of infection still circulating.
Professor Philip Nolan of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) said the number of patients with the virus in hospital will fall very slowly in the coming weeks.
He added there is concern about a high incidence of the virus among the over-75s.
Over three weeks up to 1,000 residents a week in long-term residential care have been catching the virus along with 500 staff in these facilities.
He was speaking as seven more deaths and 1,372 newly cases were reported.
The number of patients in intensive care rose by one to 219 and there is one-third more now in ICU treatment compared to the first wave.
There are 1,905 Covid-19 patients in hospital, down from around 2,000.
But daily admissions have fallen from as many as 140 to 74 yesterday.
Virus-related deaths have reached 688 this month, with an average of 52 deaths a day.
Deadly
There was a death toll of 175 in December and 164 in November.
Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said there was no evidence to link the higher deaths to preliminary data by UK scientists who believe the new, more infectious UK variant is more deadly.
Prof Nolan said: "We are seeing higher levels of infection acquired among health staff and among patients than at any point in the pandemic."
He cited the UK variant for contributing to the spread.
"We are seeing over 5pc of infection acquired among patients and 5pc among staff in healthcare settings," he added.
"That relates to the high level of virus entering those settings from the community."
Dr Glynn said there is still no evidence that the more infectious Brazilian strain of the virus is here.
Asked about funerals he said that in recent months there were a number of incidents where they led to significant large outbreaks.
On schools he said at this point it was not the time to instigate the mobility of one million people.
Commenting on whether people should take vitamin D supplements to increase their defences, he said it was important for people who are at home cocooning to maintain their levels of this vitamin.

Lotto bans credit cards to 'tackle problem gambling'

The National Lottery is to end gambling by credit card on its Lotto draws and games.
From February 4, members of the public will no longer be able to link a credit card or commercial card to a new account.
Card-linkage has enabled users in recent times to programme their favourite numbers to be automatically selected for each draw, with an accompanying charge against the card.
Customers who already have cards linked to their account will be unaffected for now, but will have to change "soon".
The National Lottery said in a new message to account holders: "We're always looking at ways to promote and improve responsible play.
"It's something we take very seriously, which is why we have taken the decision to phase out the use of credit cards and commercial cards as a means of payment for playing online."
The National Lottery is now owned by a consortium that benefits the Ontario teachers' pension fund in Canada.
The new move will prevent users from running up credit card debts in pursuit of a desperate dream.
Phase
"We will get to a stage where only personal debit and pre-paid debit cards will be accepted, in line with best practice," the company said.
The ban on new credit cards will be followed by a second phase, in which customers will no longer be able to top up their account using any credit card or commercial card.
Customers were told: "Don't worry, we'll let you know closer to the time the change is about to take place."
Those whose account is linked to a debit card have been told there is no need to take any action.
But those linked to a credit card are encouraged to switch to a debit card soon to avoid disruption later on.
The email ends: "Please continue to play responsibly, play for fun."
The move follows a ban on credit card use for lotto gambling in the UK.
It means the National Lottery here is following efforts by the British government to tackle problem gambling while protecting vulnerable customers.
"Credit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm," said Neil McArthur, the UK commission's chief executive.

Passengers arriving into Ireland without proof of a negative Covid-19 test will be held in quarantine for up to two weeks under plans agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Covid-19.
Anyone travelling from Brazil or South Africa will also be held in State-run quarantine hotels for up to a fortnight.
The Cabinet Committee also agreed to temporarily suspend all visa-free short-term travel from South Africa and Brazil.
Anyone arriving without a negative PCR test will also face a fine up to €2,500 and/or six months' imprisonment.
Passengers will have to pay for their own stay in quarantine hotels, which may be policed by security firms.
The committee also agreed to increase Garda checkpoints near all ports and airports.
Gardaí will check travellers to see if they are returning from abroad without an essential reason for travelling.
If this is the case they will be fined for breaching the 5km travel restriction.
The current fine for breaching travel restrictions will be increased from the current penalty of €100.
A source said all new measures will take time to legislate for if agreed by Cabinet.
Meanwhile, gardaí have reminded the public that foreign holidays are "not deemed essential" as they announced around 1,500 fines have been issued in the past two weeks for breaking the 5km travel limit.
Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said gardaí had put checkpoints near airports since Friday in an attempt to cut out non-essential flying.
He also told Claire Byrne on RTÉ Radio 1 that there will be extra checks near the Border, but said the idea of restricting travel across the Border or creating an "all-island bubble isn't politically possible as of yet".
"If someone is on a road 5km south of the Border, and doesn't have a valid reason as to why they are travelling, they will be subject to prosecution and a fine," he said.
"The guards have those powers."
Since the introduction of fines two weeks ago, 909 people have been processed and about 645 fines are being ­processed.
Gardaí also reminded the public that if a driver is found to be in breach of travel regulations and more than 5km from their home, adult passengers can be fined as well as the driver.
Allowed
This is also the case for adults who are stopped while cycling or walking.
A Garda spokesperson said its series of checkpoints and high-visibility patrols at public amenities across the country will continue.
He added: "An Garda Síochána is reminding people that they are only allowed to exercise within 5km of home.
"The 5km limit includes the distance travelled from a person's home to a location for exercise.
"In other words, you can't travel more than 5km to a location to exercise.
"In addition, An Garda Síochána is reminding the public that travel to airports and ports should only be taken for essential reasons."
Deputy Commissioner, Policing and Security, John Twomey said: "The vast majority of people are complying with the non-essential travel regulations.
"We thank them for that. People need to adhere to the public health regulations to help save lives and reduce that pressure.
"Please keep yourself and others safe by staying home. Limit your contacts. Practise social distancing. Wash your hands."

A young Dublin woman whose recovery from brain surgery is being helped by the devotion of her rescue dog is urging fellow animal lovers to take part in a new charity fundraising drive.
The initiative from Dogs Trust Ireland calls on dog owners to walk 99km with or without their canine companions during the month of February.
Pain
Róisín Tracey (24), from Drimnagh, Dublin, credits her flat-coated retriever Freya - who was found abandoned on the M50 as a pup in 2017 - with being a loyal 'canine carer' who has been a constant source of support for her while she recovers from brain surgery.
Ms Tracey underwent surgery last October for a rare nerve disorder called trigeminal neuralgia, which causes excruciating facial pain and other painful symptoms that have left her unable to work.
But thanks to the support of Freya, whom she adopted as an eight-month-old pup, she is never alone as she recovers.
"She is so in tune with me.
"She can tell if I'm in any pain and will be really quiet. She'll put her paw in my lap to let me know she's there for me," she said, adding Freya is an inspiration on their daily 7km walks.

Love Island star Maura Higgins has revealed that she is desperately missing her friends and family in Ireland as she waits out the lockdown in her adopted home of  England.
The former hairdresser, who was the breakout star of the 2019 series of the dating show, spoke about her new life in the UK, where she is now dating fellow reality star Chris Taylor.
"I miss being able to go home and see my family and friends back in Ireland," she said. "But I'm always on FaceTime to my family back home. England is definitely home for me now - I feel really settled over here."
Enabled
"It's hard not being able to fly back to see my friends and family as often as I'd like to but lockdown has enabled me to slow down a bit - it's really the first break I've had since leaving Love Island.
"I do think the pandemic has made everyone appreciate the little things more than they used to; it's allowed everybody to take a step back and see what is important."
Despite not clicking romantically while they're were both on Love Island, the Longford native stuck up a relationship with Taylor three months ago, having previously dated Curtis Pritchard.
She said the most important thing was establishing a friendship first with Taylor.
"It's great as we were so comfortable with each other from the beginning. I think the best relationships come from being friends first.
"We laugh so much together and are really happy," she told the Herald.
"We like to have a date night once a week; even during lockdown we've been getting dressed up and cooking a meal."
Higgins, who marked her 30th birthday last November, is estimated to have already made her first million thanks to some lucrative collaborations with top brands.

'Exams in a pandemic must be so hard, that's why we're doing this show' - Bláthnaid

RTÉ's Bláthnaid Treacy said she feels huge sympathy for students sitting their Junior and Leaving Certificates amid the uncertainty created by the pandemic.
The gaeilgeoir is currently fronting a new, two-hour bilingual show on 2fm called StaidAir, which airs on weekdays at 8pm in a bid to support those students facing into their Irish orals and trying to prepare at home.
"I can't even imagine how hard it must be for them. It's just the unknown.
"When you're doing the Leaving Cert, you know it's coming, you know there's these exams and that's daunting enough as it is.
"But just not to know what's happening is so hard while you're also trying to prepare. It's too much, it really is," she told the Herald.
"But the resounding message that keeps coming back to us on the show is the examiners are all teachers too.
"They're all rooting for you and they want you to do well. We are all in this together so picking up a few extra words without even realising it is the main aim of the show."
Every night she will try to cover one of the subjects that is due to come up in the orals and Bláthnaid said they are getting great feedback.
"The Irish language is a difficult one for a lot of people if you didn't go to an Irish-language school or have Irish-speaking members in your family.
"It's all about trying to make the Irish language more accessible and take away the fear that a lot of people have with it," she said.
"It's a bilingual show so people will know what's going on even if their level of Irish isn't great, but it's an entertainment show as well with lots of music and showbiz gossip as well."
The former Can't Stop Dancing presenter, who married her musician husband Charlie Mooney in June 2019, also opened up about how she stays strong mentally during the litany of lockdowns.
The Glenroe child star, who comes from Bray, Co Wicklow, said she has ditched running for the gentler pursuit of morning yoga as well as walking and said this has really helped with the winter blues.
"Everyone has a certain time of year when their mental health isn't great and for me, it's every October and November.
"I don't know why, it just happens to be really hard, maybe it's just the darker nights," she said.
"But I didn't really have it this year and I put it down to yoga because it is a difficult period for me.
"I was just talking to Charlie about it, how I really didn't get those blues I normally get. And we have more reasons than ever to feel blue right now. But I feel all right this year."
StaidAir with Bláthnaid Treacy is on 2fm at 8-10pm Mondays-Thursdays.

'Vitamin D helps build resistance to Covid'

Medical experts are urging people to take Vitamin D supplements to help protect against Covid-19.
The group, from a number of Irish universities, have appealed to the Government to issue updated guidelines for all adults on Vitamin D supplements, which they say can significantly reduce the risk of infection, serious illness and death from Covid-19.
However, to date there has been no action despite mounting evidence showing the benefits of taking supplements.
The group has pointed to studies describing significant reductions in death amongst older nursing home patients and substantial reductions in ICU admission rates amongst hospitalised Covid-19 patients after taking Vitamin D.
They also highlight emerging evidence from Andalusia in Spain, where a public health initiative to give Vitamin D supplements to all vulnerable groups coincided with a fall in daily death rates.
Lacking
Vitamin D is lacking in the Irish population across all age groups and so experts including Professor Declan Byrne, clinical director at St James' Hospital, and Professor Rose Anne Kenny, principal investigator of Tilda, are now urging the Department of Health to increase its current guidelines.
A daily intake of 20-25 microgrammes is recommended for adults to build protection against the virus.
Another academic involved in this work, Dr Dan McCartney, who is programme director of human nutrition and dietetics at TU Dublin and Trinity College, said: "Along with mask-wearing, hand-washing, social-distancing and cough etiquette, taking Vitamin D supplements now will give the Irish population a degree of protection while the vaccine is being rolled out."

'We can't let guard down' - cases fall below 2,000 for 2 consecutive days

Levels of coronavirus in the community are falling, with 1,373 new cases confirmed yesterday.
It was the first time this year that new cases fell below 2,000 for two consecutive days, after 1,910 cases were reported on Saturday.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said that "while are starting to make progress in reducing the level of the virus in the community", there is still a "huge volume of disease in the country".
58pc of yesterday's new cases were among those under the age of 45. The median age among those infected was 39.
There were 23 further deaths reported, with a median age of 84. The age range of those who died was between 61 and 99.
A total of 2,970 people have now died from the virus while there have been 187,554 confirmed cases, the National Public Health Emergency Team announced last night.
Women accounted for 730 of yesterday's new cases and 643 cases were among men.
Dublin recorded 379 cases, followed by Cork with 145, Wexford with 86, Galway with 85 and Limerick with 71. Another 612 cases were spread across the country.
There are now 218 patients with Covid-19 in ICUs and 1,931 people with the infection in hospitals across the State.
Over the weekend, 44 more patients with Covid-19 were admitted to hospital.
The 14-day incidence rate now stands at 840.7 per 100,000 of the population.
While the figures represent a decline in the numbers of new infections compared with recent numbers, Dr Holohan urged the public to hold firm.
He said now is a "critical time" to remain vigilant to stop further spread of the virus.
"While we are starting to make progress in reducing the level of the virus in the community, this is a critical time for all of us to hold firm to the public health advice.
"We must not let down our guard against this highly infectious disease and the risk it poses to ourselves and those most medically vulnerable to infection," he said.
"There is a huge volume of disease in the country and the recent surge in cases continues to place an unprecedented strain on ICUs, hospitals and other frontline healthcare services.
"The answer lies in driving down social contacts and congregation in all settings, including in workplaces," he said, adding anyone who can work from home must do so.
Meanwhile, as various groups call to have quicker access to vaccinations, Dr Siobhán O'Sullivan, chief bioethics officer for the Department of Health, said advancing age is the greatest risk factor for becoming seriously ill or dying from the virus and the roll-out of the vaccination programme must take that into account.
"Those who have an increased risk of dying or developing severe disease have been prioritised to receive a Covid vaccine.
Amplified
"Increasing age is the clearest risk factor associated with dying or becoming very ill if you contract the virus.
"This risk is amplified for older persons living in long term residential care as they have a higher risk of exposure to infection.
"In Ireland in the first wave of Covid-19, 56pc of deaths occurred in this setting.
"This is likely compounded by the presence of underlying conditions which increase with advancing age," she said.
Frontline healthcare workers have been prioritised in the first phase of the vaccine roll-out as they are also at high risk of exposure to the virus.
In the first wave, more than 30pc of cases of Covid-19 were in this group.

Anti-hate laws key to tackling racism, Holocaust Day told

Taoiseach Micheál Martin warned that Ireland and the world must use education and anti-hate laws as strategic tools to fight extremism, racism and anti-semitism.
The warning came as the Taoiseach delivered the keynote address at Ireland's ­Holocaust Memorial Day.
Organisers stressed that the commemoration was now more important than ever given the rise in far right groups across the world, soaring levels of misinformation and hate speech as well as an alarming surge in anti-semitism. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the event was staged virtually.
The ceremony annually remembers the six million Jewish people and millions of other victims who were murdered due to their ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, political affiliations or religious beliefs during World War II.
Holocaust survivors and Irish residents Tomi Reichental and Suzi Diamond offered personal recollections of the Holocaust.
Tool
"Education is an important tool in deepening our understanding of the Holocaust and fighting against racism and anti-semitism," Mr Martin said.
"We are (also) currently working on a number of measures across all areas of Government to address hatred and intolerance.
"The purpose of this work is to ensure we can identify how Ireland's law in this area can be improved, based on a clear understanding of the experiences of those impacted, while remaining in harmony with the very important right to free expression.
"In June 2020, the Government also appointed an anti-racism committee with a mandate to develop a new National Action Plan against Racism."
He said a core element of this work will be to promote the inclusion of minority groups in Irish society.
"This is a fight that will need to be sustained with energy and application into the future as new technologies and ever-evolving platforms provide new opportunities for old prejudice and hate." He slated anti-semitism and racism as "an ugly scourge".
Mr Reichental survived the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp and later settled in Ireland. "What we saw was hell on earth," he warned.
Jonathan Philips (66) had his father's entire family fall victim to the Holocaust.
"My father was very hesitant to talk about his experience while we were growing up. After his death we found about a hundred-odd pages of his account handwritten which I regret not knowing more about before."

Government likely to bow to stricter new travel rules

Mandatory quarantine for people travelling into Ireland without proof of being ­Covid-free and tighter north-south border Covid checks are to be considered by Government ministers meeting today.
The Government is likely to bow to pressure for new rules on quarantine.
Strategy
The Covid-19 ministers' sub-committee will try to recommend a strategy to boost the trend of lowering virus cases and ease near-breakpoint pressure on hospital services.
But one Government source has conceded "there are still more questions than answers" about the detail of new regulations to be adopted.
The major stumbling block remains how to deal with people travelling in from Northern Ireland, who could seriously undermine a Dublin government plan to oblige people landing here to have a certificate issued within the previous 72 hours showing themselves to be Covid-free.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has spoken with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the weekend about a "two islands" joint approach to the issue of people travelling in from overseas.
"But anything which might come of that remains to be seen," one government source told the Herald.
Mr Martin said mandatory quarantine of up to five days may be considered for people travelling into Ireland without proof of a so-called PCR test delivered within the previous 72 hours.
But others in Government point out medical experts rarely view a five-day quarantine as sufficient and more usually insist on 14 days.
Last night officials said there is clear pressure on the Government to act.
"But three practical obstacles remain in the way. These are questions of accommodation, transport and how to enforce any such quarantine," said one source.
Officials in all three Coalition parties - Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party - insisted their leaders are united on the need for action but are still undecided on the practical implications of whatever extra restrictions they involve.
Suppression
They expect some proposals will emerge later today to be put before Cabinet tomorrow.
Labour Party leader Alan Kelly has said a longer lockdown should be implemented to suppress Covid-19 along with a "national aggressive suppression strategy".
Speaking on RTÉ radio's This Week, he said the Border should be better policed to stop non-essential travel and that mandatory quarantine should be introduced for all visitors arriving here.
He added that it was inevitable that the Leaving Cert would be cancelled.

Irish citizens held abroad saved by crack garda team

Garda negotiation specialists have helped secure the safe return of eight Irish citizens, who had been held against their will in foreign countries in the past three years.
The role played by highly trained members of the Garda national negotiation unit, which is part of the force's Special Tactics and Operations Command (STOC), has not previously been revealed.
One other Irish citizen, James Hillis, who disappeared in Colombia in 2019, is still on the missing list.
Mr Hillis, who is from Wexford, is feared to have fallen foul of a drug trafficking gang,
Over the last few years, members of the negotiation unit (NNU) have assisted the local authorities in securing the safe return of Irish citizens in Nigeria, Ghana, Sudan, South Africa, Cambodia, Brazil, Algeria and Romania.
Gardai have been deployed on the ground dealing with incidents in Ghana, Nigeria, Sudan and Cambodia and worked closely there with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and local authorities.
Some of those who disappeared were victims of kidnapping by local crime gangs, seeking a ransom, while others were held for other reasons.
While efforts were under way abroad to ensure the Irish were set free unharmed, the gardaí kept in regular contact at home with their families, updating them on the progress made in their inquiries. The incident in Ghana was described as particularly complex and as well as the gardaí it also involved police from Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany.
Negotiations
Apart from the Hillis case, the longest negotiation to secure a release was in Sudan and lasted three months.
Most of the incidents have involved crime gangs but gardaí say they are often concerned that the kidnappers could sell or pass on their victims to more organised terrorist groups, creating fresh difficulties and much bigger ransom demands.
But there have been no terror-related kidnaps of Irish citizens since the abduction and murder in Iraq in 2005 of Irish-born Margaret Hassan, who grew up in London
She carried an Irish passport and the government in Dublin, under Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, repeatedly emphasised her Irish connections in an attempt to "soften" the stance of the kidnappers.
Some to start a fresh life, particularly after the last recession.
Gardaí are reluctant to discuss details of the individual cases where the NNU has been deployed, at home or overseas.
The head of the NNU, Detective Inspector Tony Ryan explained that their operations were deliberately kept low key as any publicity, particularly in the overseas incidents, could be counter productive and put the victim on greater danger.

Savers hit as An Post cuts rates and Bonds

The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has cut the interest rates on a string of State Savings products, in a move that is set to hit savers hard.
Amounts that can be won on Prize Bonds have also been pared back.
The savings products, which are sold by An Post, are popular because they pay some of the highest interest rates in the market, and most of them do not attract DIRT.
Banks are now paying savers at best just 0.01pc for demand deposits, with larger customers such as credit unions and pension funds having negative interest rates imposed on them by banks.
Credit unions have been restricting member savings to as low as €10,000 as they grapple with a surfeit of savings and weak demand for loans.
The new An Post Savings Scheme rates took effect from yesterday, the NTMA said.
However, the new lower rates will not affect those with existing Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, Instalment Savings, and 10-Year National Solidarity Bonds.
But from February the fund for Prize Bonds will be smaller for those who have them.
Instead of two €1m top prizes a year for those with Prize Bonds, there will now be four €250,000 top prizes a year. This is an effective cut of €1m in the top prize.
An NTMA spokesman said: "The new rates reflect the reductions in interest rates in both sovereign bond yields and the retail savings market.
"State Savings interest rates were last adjusted in June/July 2016, with the exception of Prize Bonds where the rate fund was adjusted in August 2017."
Down
The rate on newly issued 10-Year National Solidarity Savings Bonds has gone from 16pc to 10pc, which is from 1.5pc in annual terms to 0.96pc
There are some €19bn invested in State Savings products, which includes the money in Prize Bonds.
When the money in the Post Office Savings Bank is included, the total comes to €22.7bn.
There is another €124bn in household savings in banks and credit unions.
Financial adviser John Lowe, the author of Money Doctors 2021, said that despite the cuts the State Savings Scheme products were still the best value in the market.

A haulier and his girlfriend have been arrested as part of a drugs and cash seizure targeting a major crime gang based in the north-east.
Detectives also recovered a firearm and ammunition during a series of raids in two border counties over the weekend.
Members of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) carried out a number of searches in Monaghan and Louth at around 12pm on Saturday.
During the operation, cannabis herb with an estimated street value of more than €1.1m was recovered along with €100,000 in cash.
Gardaí believe the money is the proceeds of crime and the profits of a large drug dealing network based in the north-east of the country.
It's understood the drugs were discovered during one raid at a Monaghan property where a man and a woman were also arrested.
The 29-year-old male in custody is a haulier suspected of being used to store drugs for the criminal gang.
His 26-year-old girlfriend was also arrested and both are currently being detained at Castleblayney Garda Station on suspicion of involvement in drug trafficking.
A Garda spokesman said they are currently being detained pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.
They can be held for a period of up to seven days before being charged or released pending a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
Members of the Garda Dog Unit also assisted in the searches.
Assistant Garda Commissioner John O'Driscoll, who oversees the Garda's national units investigating organised and serious crime, said the seizure will help in their aim to dismantle the gangs they are targeting.
Rigour
"Organised crime groups continue to operate despite the existence of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the Garda Síochána is pursuing them with rigour and determination.
"It is this determination which has given rise to success today, whereby the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau assisted by the Garda Dog Unit, have located and seized a sizable quantity of drugs, a firearm, ammunition and cash suspected to the proceeds of crime," the senior garda said.
It is the latest seizure by the GNDOCB in recent weeks. Last weekend more than €1m in cash was seized in a separate operation targeting a Cabra drug dealer.

A woman has been sent for trial accused of allowing her home to be used for the preparation of cocaine, after gardaí seized €5,000 worth of the drug in a search.
Lisa Marie Connolly (40) had a book of evidence served on her when she appeared in Dublin District Court.
Judge Bryan Smyth sent her forward for trial to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.
Ms Connolly, of Courtney Place, Ballybough, is charged with knowingly permitting her premises to be used for the manufacture, preparation or production of a controlled drug. She is also charged with possession of cocaine with intent to sell or supply.
A state solicitor said the DPP was consenting to the accused being sent for trial.
Alibi
Judge Smyth gave Ms Connolly notice that she had 14 days to adduce any alibi evidence.
He sent her forward on existing bail terms and granted free legal aid after hearing there had been no change in her financial circumstances.
The judge also ordered the prosecution to furnish the defence with copies of Ms Connolly's garda interview video.
Previously, the court heard the accused was allegedly befriended by younger people who were using the premises to prepare drugs and Ms Connolly "didn't really realise what was going on."
Her solicitor said the accused suffered from a mental health difficulty.
The DPP had consented to the case being heard at district court level but Judge Smyth refused jurisdiction.

A 14-year-old boy has been arrested in relation to a knife attack that led to an office cleaner needing life-saving surgery after she was stabbed in the neck.
The teenager was being questioned yesterday by detectives at Store Street garda station after his arrest on Thursday night.
He is from the capital's north inner city and, despite his age, has had previous interactions with gardaí.
The 48-year-old victim remained yesterday in a critical condition in the Mater Hospital following the attack on Wednesday night.
Sources said there are "grave fears" that she may not survive.
She is the mother of at least two children and has been living in Dublin for a number of years.
Gardaí are not looking for anyone else in relation to the attack, were to decide last night on charging or releasing the teenager.
"Gardaí in Store Street investigating the serious assault that occurred on the pedestrian walkway between Georges Dock and Custom House Quay, IFSC, on Wednesday night have made an arrest," a garda spokeswoman said.
Fleeing
"A juvenile has been arrested and is currently detained at Store Street garda station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984."
The attack happened near the CHQ building.
A lone male on a bicycle approached the woman, who was walking home from work, and demanded money.
He then stabbed her without warning before fleeing empty-handed.
Despite her injuries, which resulted in considerable loss of blood, the woman was able to call emergency services from her mobile phone.
Gardaí and ambulance personnel were quickly on the scene, and she was rushed to the Mater Hospital where she underwent life-saving surgery.
The area has "excellent quality CCTV", and detectives were able to make rapid progress in their investigations.
"This lady is very, very lucky to be alive," a source said.
"This was a very savage crime. She didn't even put up a fight and presented no threat to the attacker.
"The area was deserted at the time because of all the travel restrictions.
"Gardaí are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who was in the vicinity of Custom House Quay, George's Dock, Harbourmaster Place or Connolly station between 9.15pm and 10pm on Wednesday, January 20, to contact gardaí.
"Any individuals who may have camera footage of this incident is asked to make it available."

Senior officers in the Defence Forces are planning to increase their involvement in the battle against Covid if required.
Since last March, the mili-tary has completed 58,658 individual tasks.
This includes significant efforts in recent weeks in terms of swab testing and contact tracing.
Chief of staff Vice Admiral Mark Mellett said they decided at the start of the pandemic to launch Operation Fortitude.
The "muscle" behind that was a joint task force built out of their experience in missions such as Afghanistan and west Africa.
Military planners have developed contingency plans to provide the HSE with increased "surge capacity".
This frontline support will continue until the suppression of the third wave of the killer virus.
Flights
The military has committed nearly 60 first responders, providing for up to an additional 4,000 swab tests a day.
Defence Forces personnel were trained by the HSE over Christmas, bringing the total number available for contact tracing to 100.
The Air Corps has carried out 19 flights to Germany with swab tests to be analysed, while since the middle of this month two dozen have been deployed to four nursing homes in Munster for non-clinical duties.
Lieutenant Colonel Louis Flynn is helping with plann-ing and logistics for vaccination tasks, while the Air Corps has transported vaccines to remote locations and will be available to fly medical staff and vaccines to islands.
The Defence Forces also have a pool of 50 central medical unit personnel, consisting of emergency medical technicians, paramedics and advance paramedics, available to help the HSE with administering vaccines.

Dentist employee forged sick notes for time off work

A dental clinic worker handed in forged sick certificates to her employer when doctors would not give them to her to get time off, a court heard.
Samantha Croft (28), who passed off three fake documents as genuine, said she had been suffering from depression and her GPs would not give her "what she wanted" to get sick leave.
Judge Bryan Smyth applied the Probation Act, sparing her a criminal record.
Croft, of St Berach's Place, Kilbarrack, pleaded guilty.
Dublin District Court heard it was reported to gardaí last March 15 that the accused had used three false sick notes at her former workplace at Northumberland Dental Care, Dublin 4.
The offences were committed between February 2019 and last March.
The doctors involved made statements of complaint after they were notified that their names had been used on the documents, which had been accepted as genuine.
Advantage
Croft had submitted the certificates to her employers, saying she was sick and could not go to work.
She had no previous convictions and had given gardaí a voluntary statement.
The accused was a single parent and had a good work history, her lawyer said.
However, she "took advantage of her knowledge of the work she was doing".
The offences were not committed for any personal gain, but to get time off while she was "struggling."
Judge Smyth asked if the accused was "looking for extra days' holidays".
The defence lawyer said Croft had been suffering from depression and "wasn't getting what she wanted from the doctors she was seeing and went and took it into her own hands".
"I'm sorry," Croft told the judge. "What I did was wrong."
She was "throwing herself at the mercy of the court", her lawyer said.
Judge Smyth said he would give Croft a chance.

Deliveroo riders in Dublin went on strike for two hours last night in a protest over pay and conditions.
They are seeking increased delivery fees for taking meals to customers and measures to improve their safety while working.
They said on social media that they hoped their action would ensure people "realise the importance" of their work.
It is not known how many took part in the action.
Korean restaurant Chimac switched off Deliveroo during the strike hours from 6pm to 8pm as a "demonstration of our solidarity".
"These men and women have got us, and you, through the last 10 months of madness - they work incredibly hard," it said on Twitter.
In a statement, a Deliveroo spokesperson said: "The safety of riders is our absolute priority and we take every step to ensure they feel safe when on the road.
"We were the first delivery platform to give all riders free insurance to protect them in case something goes wrong while on the road, and we are constantly looking at new ways to extend our support.
Alarms
"We plan to introduce free personal safety alarms for all riders in Ireland that they can use in an emergency.
"We also work very closely with the police and authorities to help protect riders and resolve any security issues they face."
In relation to pay, the company has said that following feedback from riders, it introduced distance-based fees, a structure that pays riders more for medium and long-distance deliveries.
Labour senator Marie Sherlock said her party stands with Deliveroo riders, adding that the workers are asking for engagement on very basic issues.
Fine Gael senator Mary Seery-Kearney also shared her support, saying: "They are a lifeline during lockdown."

Hundreds of items are nowhere to be seen in Dublin supermarkets.
Post-Brexit problems are being blamed for much of the disruption, although some chains claim a change in buying patterns, with more consumers at home in lockdown, is having an impact.
Everything from Volvic mineral water to Scottish smoked mackerel and Cadbury's confectionery was missing at various points in our trawl.
Marks & Spencer has been affected by the disruption to UK supply chains, and there were a number of items missing when we visited.
In Tesco in Clarehall, north Dublin, labels indicate that some items will not be delivered until next month.

Dunnes and SuperValu also appeared to be missing items, although the issue was less apparent in German supermarkets Aldi and Lidl.
The M&S food hall in the Omni Park Shopping Centre in Santry appeared to have run out of a variety of foods including Scottish smoked peppered mackerel, air-dried mini chorizo bites, medium cured pork pies and Viennese all-butter swirl biscuits.
The chain's flagship Grafton Street store was missing fruit and veg, along with many pre-cooked meals.
M&S has been forthcoming about the impact of Brexit, and a sign noted that supply chains from the UK have been affected for the near future.
"Following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we're transitioning to new processes and it's taking a little longer for some of our products to reach our stores," a spokesman said.
"We're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy the same great range of products."
In Tesco in Clarehall, blue labels were dotted around the shelves, each reading "Sorry out of stock".
The chain insisted it was well-prepared for Brexit, but there were some availabiity issues.
Among the treats missing were Swizzels giant love hearts, Chupa Chups lollipops, Cadbury snack bars, Kinder Surprise eggs and Animal Bar milk chocolate packs.
Six-packs of Volvic mineral water were gone, leaving customers with the choice to buy six single bottles.
Fresh-cut chips were out of stock, along with fresh Tesco cabbage and leek packs.
Aromatic shredded duck pancakes were not due for delivery until February 15, according to a label, and parts of the dairy and frozen food section looked relatively bare.
A Tesco spokesperson said: "Owing to our extensive Brexit preparation, stock-building and collaboration with suppliers, our supply chain is robust and is responding well, with plenty of stock to go around.
"As the food industry responds to this new environment, customers may experience some temporary availability issues on products such as prepared ready meals, pre-packed fish, chilled dess-erts and some seasonal produce lines.
"We continue to work with the new processes implemented at ports, and in turn with our suppliers and relevant authorities to resolve any short-term issues as quickly as possible.
"We thank our customers for their patience and remind them there is no need to change their buying habits."
SuperValu blamed a change in shopping habits instead of Brexit for some omissions from its own shelves, notably in the alcohol section.
Tequila Rose was out of stock, as was Fireball - a liquor mixed with Canadian whisky. Italian wine Intrigo Primitivo Puglia and Australian shiraz Nugan Estate Alfredo were also out of stock, along with Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and Freixenet Cordon Negro Brut Cava.
Jus-Rol shortcrust pastry sheets, Terry's Chocolate Orange, Toblerone 360g bars and Cadbury Fudge five-packs were also missing.
A SuperValu spokesman said: "We've not experienced any disruption to date due to Brexit.
"We're seeing a spike in demand for groceries due to a combination of families spending more time at home as a result of the latest Covid-19 restrictions and the cold weather.
"Due to heightened demand, a limited number of products are selling out faster than expected compared to our regular January forecasts, but they are re-ordered on an ongoing basis to ensure ongoing availability on store shelves."
Cucumbers
In Dunnes, cucumbers were missing from the fruit and veg section.
McColgan's cocktail sausage rolls were sold out, as was Dunnes southern fried chicken, Dunnes smoky boneless beef ribs, Irish beef burgers and Dunnes milk chocolate digestives.
In the baby food section, Heinz Blueberry Porridge tub and scoop was out of stock, as was Heinz Banana Porridge tub and scoop and Heinz Fruit and Yoghurt Cereal tub and scoop.
However, very little seemed to be missing from Aldi and Lidl.
A Lidl Ireland spokeswoman said: "We've been scenario planning and preparing for Brexit for more than three years and as a result we do not have significant supply issues at present."
John Curtin, group buying director at Aldi Ireland, said: "Our buying teams are working very closely with our suppliers to ensure there is no disruption to our supply chain."

Irish dancer's poison killer is jailed for life

A man who poisoned an Irish dancer with a date-rape drug known as Devil's Breath in order to rob him has been handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 32 years.
Joel Osei (26) killed 43-year-old Kilkenny man Adrian Murphy in June 2019 with an overdose of scopolamine.
Mr Murphy had worked as a dance teacher and choreo- grapher at the Royal Academy of Dance in London, but was on a year-long sabbatical at the time of his murder.
Osei and his ex-girlfriend and co-defendant Diana Cristea (19) targeted gay men on Grindr in order to rob them of their valuables and drain their bank accounts.
Diamonds
After killing Mr Murphy, the pair tried to buy $80,000 (€66,000) worth of diamonds from a jeweller in New York.
They were further convicted of poisoning a second man with the same drug two days earlier.
That victim, who cannot be named due to a reporting restriction, survived but was taken to hospital after being found by a neighbour, almost naked, agitated and confused.
Mr Murphy is thought to have died some time between meeting Osei on June 1 and his body being discovered by his best friend and former partner on June 4.
His phone had been thrown down the toilet, while a can of Coca-Cola was found to contain traces of scopolamine.
Osei's fingerprints were discovered on a bottle of whiskey left at the scene.
Toxicology tests revealed the concentration of scopolamine in Mr Murphy's body was many times the level consistent with a fatal overdose.
Cristea and Osei were both convicted of murder following a trial at Croydon Crown Court.
Jailing Osei for life, Mr Justice William Davis said: "You left him either dying or dead and set about using his debit and credit cards.
"You gave Mr Murphy, quite deliberately, a significant dose of a drug which you know could cause death."

Micheál and Biden are keen to cement Irish-US friendship

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said Covid-19 may have an impact on the traditional St Patrick's Day visit to the White House by members of the Government.
He revealed that president Joe Biden spoke "emotionally" of his Irish heritage when the leaders chatted recently and that they are "keen to cement the very historic relationship" between the US and Ireland.
Mr Martin said US and Irish officials will engage on the issue of the traditional St Patrick's Day visit to the White House by the Taois- each and will do what is "best and most safe, obviously. Covid may very well have an impact on that".
Jokingly
"There will be no decisions made in relation to that yet," the Toaiseach said.
"I did invite President Biden to Ireland and, rather jokingly, he said to me, 'Try and keep me out'
"In relation to St Patrick's Day, that is an honoured tradition in the relationship between Ireland and the United States."
Mr Martin added that both leaders are keen to cement the historic relationship between the two countries.
"It is an important relationship in the modern era," he said.
"It has cultural and artistic manifestations, and it has economic manifestations too."
Last year during his visit to Washington DC, then Taoiseach Leo Varadkar made an announcement to the nation that all schools and colleges would close in mid-March in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.
Mr Varadkar's state visit was cut short due to the worsening situation at home and the traditional passing of the bowl of shamrock did not go ahead.
Mr Martin told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last night of the "genuine warmth" felt by the Irish people towards Mr Biden.
"It's a source of great pride that the great-grandson of Irish emigrants has become president of the United States. There was elation at his elevation this week," he said.
"He spoke to me in the aftermath of his election almost emotionally about his heritage and the lessons and values of an Irish family in Scranton."
President Biden also told the Taoiseach of his "great fondness" for Mayo and Louth, the counties from where his ancestors emigrated to the US in the 19th century.

Staycation 'fever pitch' as resorts already booked out

Popular seaside resorts are running out of summer rental properties as families give up hope of getting a sun package due to the Covid-19 crisis.
One property agent described as 'fever pitch' the demand for seaside houses during the summer.
Lisa Kearney of Rooney Auctioneers in Limerick: said: "Owners will get €1,000 a week or more during the holiday months of June, July and August, no bother. Most are done by word of mouth or online.
"I have a lot of clients who want to get a house and can't get one for love nor money in places like Kilkee, Lahich and Carrigaholt at the moment," she said.
"Normally we would have people on to us during January and February looking for a house on the Clare coast during July and August.
"But the numbers we have now getting on to us to see if we have anything on our books is unbelievable.
"It started last year with families who would normally go to Spain or Portugal.
"The only alternative was to take a home holiday, and for a family there is only one realistic option and that is to take a house for a week or two weeks.
"For July and August, a three-bedroom house in Kilkee would rent for between €900 and €1,200 a week, depending on it's location.
Savings
"They are being snapped up once they are advertised. The money is there as people have pent up savings during the lockdowns."
Ms Kearney said there had also been a surge in property purchases in the seaside resort areas of Clare.
Kerry auctioneer Gary O'Driscoll said the rental demand for houses in Kerry over the coming summer can only be described as 'fever pitch'.
However, he said the big problem in Kerry was the lack of sufficient new builds for sale.
He said: "There is now a big move to the west coast. We are getting a very significant amount of contact from people living in the greater Dublin area who want to relocate.
"But we just haven't the houses to cater for the demand. Just to give an example, if we had a nice property in the €350,000 price range, it would be a slow burner.
"There weren't people in the local market for more expensive houses. But by the end of the first lockdown last March things changed in a very dramatic way, as houses which were a bit expensive for the local market, began to fly off the shelf, with a surge mainly from Dublin and also the UK.
"Obviously the shift to remote working from home has been a huge factor and rural areas of North Kerry are going to benefit as the shift in population from east to west gathers momentum.
"With regards to summer rentals, the demand is just crazy."

Virus winning in race to get jabs to at-risk groups as UK strain gains dominance

There are two races under way during this Covid-19 crisis.
The first is between Covid-19 and the vaccine, and so far the virus is winning, with many more infections to injections.
The other is the race to keep one step ahead of the new, more infectious strains of the virus and slow down their arrival and spread here.
Outbreaks
Residential homes, including nursing homes, centres for people with a disability and mental health facilities are enduring a surge in infection similar to levels seen last March and April.
It is a measure of how the virus is bolting ahead of vaccinations for these most vulnerable groups.
The incidence is rising among the over-85s and the death toll this month is harrowing.
Vaccination speed
Up to the middle of this week, 121,900 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine had been administered. The aim was to give 43,700 doses to 267 long-term care facilities.
However, residents and staff who have the virus must wait. Residents of mental health and disability settings are to get a first dose by tomorrow.
Only 3,900 are still at the second dose stage, and there was a reduction in the delivery of 25,000 doses from Pfizer- BioNTech as it upgrades its Belgium plant.
Next week will see 47,000 get their second dose and become fully vaccinated.
A decision on approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is also due on Friday, and this is where so many hopes here rest on the game changer.
However, the first shipment might not arrive until mid- February, and that will limit the scramble to get as older people in long-term care and frontline health workers protected before the UK strain gains even more dominance.
Crunch decisions
The more infectious South African strain of the virus was detected here but is believed to be contained.
It may be only a matter of time before it comes in through air or sea travellers.
The other big fear is the Brazilian strain, which is not believed to be here yet.
The R number, showing how fast the virus is spreading, is now between 0.5 and 0.8, which means the cases are shrinking.
However, new infections will take longer because the more infectious UK strain, now at 60pc of cases, is only getting more controlling. Add yet more of these more-transmissible strains into the mix and a whirlwind in spread could start again.
The current system of having to get a pre-flight test before travelling here is better than nothing, but the problem is that Covid-19 might not be detected due to the incubation period of the virus.
Travellers should quarantine for a number of days here and have a second test.
Apart from a penalty, the question is what action to take with passengers without a test result and whether quarantine should be mandatory.
In the UK, plans include forcing people to spend 10 days in quarantine in a hotel staffed by security guards.
Other options include electronic tags for travellers.
If the South African and Brazilian strains prove resistant to vaccines, the drug companies will have to reformulate, although we are told it would take only a few weeks.
Staying the course
The big fear among public health officials is that people will not be able to sustain these restrictions for much longer, and the fall in contacts for each infected person which now averages around two will be reversed as they move about more.

Woman sues over 'breach of rights' at home for mothers

A former resident of a Cork mother and baby home has initiated a High Court damages action against the State, the HSE and the order of Catholic nuns that ran the facility.
The action has been brought by Caroline Donovan, who was twice a resident of Bessborough House in Cork - once in the mid-1980s and also for a time in the early 1990s.
She says that while there she was subjected to physical and emotional abuse, which it is claimed amounted to a breach of her constitutional rights.
The action is understood to be one of the first brought following the publication earlier this month of the final report by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.
Represented by solicitor Siobhan O'Neill and barristers Frank Callanan and Conor Duff, Ms Donovan, who is in her 50s and from Tralee, Co Kerry, intends to bring various parties before the courts in a High Court personal injuries claim.
The proceedings are expected to be formally lodged in the coming days.
The parties being sued include the minister for health, the HSE and Ireland and the Attorney General and the Congregation of Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, which ran the mother and baby home for unmarried mothers.
Forced
Ms Donovan says when she was a resident at Bessborough House she was forced to work at the facility and was also forced by the nuns to work for a family in Cork city without any pay.
She says she was subjected to harsh and unsafe working practices.
Ms Donovan also says a baby girl she gave birth to in the early 1980s was wrongfully adopted without her consent and after undue influence was exerted on her.
She says she became pregnant when she was 15 and gave birth to her daughter in a Cork hospital.
She says her child was taken to Bessborough House and was, she claims, eventually unlawfully adopted without her permission.
The case is expected to eventually come before the courts.

'I stood up to Trump for slating a marginalised group' - Purcell

Former Miss Universe Ireland Roz Purcell revealed she once called out Donald Trump for disparaging a marginalised group.
The Tipperary beauty was left shocked by a comment by the former US president when she co-presented a show with him during her time signed to his Trump Models agency.
She met the New York tycoon when she was just 19 after competing in the Miss Universe contest in Las Vegas in 2010.
During a conversation with former President Mary McAleese on her latest Walks of Life series, the healthy living campaigner said her experience of the US tycoon was much like his public persona.
"He invited me up to his office when I joined Trump Models and said 'I'm gonna make you a star, I'm gonna make you such a big star' and he didn't", she said smiling.
"But I think we all know he is full of lies right now.
"I met him lots of times. I presented golf TV with him once up at his golf estate.
"I was shocked when he actually became president because everything that you do see on TV and you hear about him is exactly what he is like.
"I remember being shocked at some of the things he said because it just was not how anyone should speak about other people.
"I remember calling him out once, I remember he said something extremely bad about a certain marginalised group. I just said 'God's people would never say that in Ireland'.
Touching
"I quickly shut up though because I remembered I was a 19-year-old who was presenting a TV show that he owned."
She also told the former Irish president that she encountered inappropriate touching from photographers during her time as a model.
"I think it's only now when I'm heading into my 30s, I realise a lot of things that I put up with weren't okay," she said.
"I definitely think as a model being so young and travelling all over the world, I became very desensitised to things like men grabbing you, photographers touching you in areas that wouldn't be okay now.
"When you're younger you don't feel like you have a voice, when you are younger you are afraid to stand up particularly in situations where everyone else on set is putting it up with it too."
During her walk with the former president in the Tipperary hills near her family's farm, she also opened up about recovering from a serious eating disorder.
All Walks of Life is on RTÉ One on Friday, January 22 at 8.30pm

'My son is missing out on his education, I want this sorted'

Fiona Sharkey Carroll says her 16-year-old son Seán has his temperature taken twice before he even enters the classroom, PPE is used and it is a "well-run school".
With that in mind, she is desperate for him to get back as she says there are already signs he is starting to regress.
Seán has Down Syndrome, autism and has sight only in one eye.
Like other students around the country, he had no school from March because of Covid-19 restrictions.
Settled
When St Mary's Special School in Drumcar, Co Louth, did resume in September, Sharkey Carroll said "it took two months for him to get settled".
Her message to the education minister and the unions is: "I would like this to be sorted out quickly. Seán is missing out on his education and his need to progress.
"Children with special needs should be able to progress, but instead what happens is they are regressing."
Parent Jacinta Walsh, who is on the board of Abacus Special School in Drogheda, which has 30 pupils, said "it is really disappointing" that a solution has not been found to allow special education to reopen.
She said a scenario should have been thrashed out with the unions in the autumn "when there was time to work out that if the numbers peaked over Christmas - as was very likely - and the schools could not go back, could we have a phased reopening?"
"Lessons were not learned from the first lockdown or July provision," she said.
"It is a complex issue and the options should have been worked through when there was time in the autumn."
Ms Walsh said principals and school management had spent days "working out complicated rotas, talking to bus people, trying to see what staff were available".
For parents, a lot of the stress is the changing situation.
"We are all getting our information from the news and from Twitter, which is not good, and parents are trying to make plans for their children," Ms Walsh said.
The important thing "is to preserve what is in general the very good relationships between families and their own individual schools".
"It would be terrible if those individual relationships were impacted by what has gone on," she added.

UFC fighter Conor McGregor has reacted to a multi-million euro lawsuit lodged against him this week, describing it as "old news".
A woman known to McGregor for many years filed the personal injury action against him and a co-defendant in the High Court in Dublin.
A second, smaller claim - also a personal injuries action - has been lodged by the woman's mother.
The nature of the allegations made in the lawsuits cannot be disclosed for legal reasons.
Excited
McGregor was asked about the lawsuits during a UFC press conference.
"It's old news, it was investigated thoroughly over the course of two long years and I was cleared of any wrong- doing, and that's it," he said.
"I have so much positivity in my life, I have got a great challenge ahead of me on Saturday night and I'm very excited to get in there."
The matter was previously the subject of an extensive garda investigation.
However, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution decided no charges should be brought.
In a statement to the Herald earlier this week, McGregor's spokesperson Karen J Kessler said: "After an exhaustive investigation conducted by the gardaí, which, in addition to interviews of the plaintiff included interviewing numerous sources, obtaining witnesses' statements, examining closed circuit footage and the cooperation of Conor McGregor, these allegations were categor- ically rejected.
"The plaintiff knows the facts contradict the assertions in this lawsuit.
"Mr McGregor will dispute any claims and is confident that justice will prevail."
McGregor will return to the octagon in Abu Dhabi this weekend.

Dublin Bus to pay gay passenger €7,500 over homophobic slurs

Dublin Bus has been ordered to pay a gay passenger €7,500 compensation after a driver was alleged to have subjected the man to anti-gay slurs.
In the case, the gay passenger alleged that the bus driver called him a "f**got" and "schizo" and told him "go on you queer" on different occasions in 2017 and 2018.
Dublin Bus denied those terms were used and told a Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) hearing the driver had made a formal complaint to gardaí concerning the passenger's behaviour and is awaiting the outcome of that complaint.
The company said the passenger has 75,000 followers on his Instagram account and one of his videos posted online was of the driver finishing his shift at Talbot Street while the passenger stands on the pavement and shouts commentary about the driver.
Dublin Bus told the hearing the driver felt threatened by the passenger videoing him and went on sick leave for three months.
Harassment
However, WRC adjudication officer Roger McGrath found the terms were used and the passenger was subjected to harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation.
Mr McGrath found that "the interactions with the driver took place as described by the complainant".
He added that respect between the passenger and driver was "sadly lacking".
Mr McGrath said that he was making the €7,500 award taking into account the stress suffered by the passenger and the protracted nature of the difficulties encountered.
The passenger alleged that the distressing and unwanted conduct he was subjected to had the purpose or effect of violating his dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading and offensive environment for him.
Dublin Bus told the hearing that the incidents complained of by the complainant were investigated but it was deemed that no disciplinary action should be taken against the driver.
The company denied that the anti-gay slurs were used but did say that relations between the driver and passenger became confrontational.
A spokeswoman for Dublin Bus said it noted the WRC outcome.

Loss of two of its biggest stars helped RTÉ slash €480,000 from massive 'talent' payroll last year

RTÉ'S claim that its overall bill for 'top talent' fell by around €480,000 last year includes the pay of the late Marian Finucane and retired Sean O'Rourke.
The two broadcasters had combined payments of €686,000 in 2019.
Ms Finucane died in January 2020, while Mr O'Rourke left his prime morning slot in May.
The national broadcaster confirmed a 15pc reduction in total fees paid to its 10 highest-paid presenters in 2020. It did not indicate if all presenters received a pay cut.
Some of its biggest stars were also promoted last year.
Claire Byrne - who earned €250,000 and was seventh on the list for 2019 - took over Mr O'Rourke's weekday slot with the Today with Claire Byrne show on RTÉ Radio 1, while continuing to present Claire Byrne Live.
Brendan O'Connor, who presented TV programme Cutting Edge, was paid €220,000 in 2019 and last year took over presenting the weekend mid-morning programme following the death of Ms Finucane.
Asked by the Herald if the pair received pay increases, an RTÉ spokesperson said: "Figures relating to RTÉ's highest-paid presenters in 2020 will be published in due course, and not before the publication of RTÉ's annual report for 2020."
The spokesperson said the broadcaster will continue to keep the fees of its top earners "under constant review" when asked if further cuts would be introduced this year.
Meanwhile, RTÉ's former group commercial director Willie O'Reilly said the stars are worth the money, describing them as "box office".
"What these presenters bring to people's lives has to be categorised as well," he said.
Trusted
"They're very well respected, they're trusted by the public and they're very experienced in the role.
"More importantly, it's what the advertisers want.
A 30-second commercial in The Late Late Toy Show is €30,000, so one hour of advertising in that show pays for Ryan Tubridy's entire annual wage."
Ryan Tubridy remains the highest-paid presenter at RTÉ, earning €495,000 a year.
However, it is understood he is among those to have since taken a pay cut.
Mr O'Reilly said "RTÉ has come some way" since the Celtic Tiger years when presenters earned more money.
"Let me take you back to 2008, when the presenter of The Late Late Show was almost on one million a year," he told Newstalk.
"They were heady times - and that was the pay in the day. You need to cut your cloth to your measure, of course, but those people who bring you the commercial audiences are even more important in the difficult times".
The 10 highest-paid stars at the broadcaster shared almost €9.5m between 2017 and 2019.
RTÉ Radio 1 presenters Tubridy, Ray D'Arcy and Joe Duffy have remained the top three highest-earning presenters for the period covered. From 2017-2019, D'Arcy's annual earnings for presenting his radio and TV show came to €450,000.
Liveline host Duffy was paid fees of €392,494 in 2019.
RTÉ said fees paid to its top 10 presenters represent less than 1pc of its overall operating costs.
Director general Dee Forbes said audiences had turned to national public media "in record numbers" throughout the pandemic.
In its 2019 annual report, published last week, RTÉ recorded a deficit of €7.2m.

Man spared jail after threatening to kill sister in drunken phone call

A brother who threatened to kill his sister in a family feud over a house inheritance has been spared a criminal record after making a charity donation.
Gary Kelly (57) warned his sister in a phone call: "Over my dead body, you won't get the house" and "there will be blood spilled - your blood."
Their mother's wish before she died was to divide the house between siblings, but a dispute broke out over a request for the property to instead go to his sister, Dublin District Court heard.
Mr Kelly had drunk too much when he made the call, and the feud "boiled over" and got to him, his defence said.
The case against him was struck out by Judge Bryan Smyth after he made a €500 charity donation.
Mr Kelly, from Grace O'Malley Road in Howth, pleaded guilty to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to his sister Kara Kelly.
Previously, Garda Sergeant Tony Flanagan told the court the victim had been at a Christmas party in Malahide on the night of December 12, 2019 when she got a phone call from a private number.
It was from her brother, the accused, who threatened her, stating "over my dead body, you won't get the house, there will be blood spilled - your blood."
She recalled him saying she and her boyfriend "would be dead" and she hung up. Later, she got two more calls from a private number and did not answer but there were then five texts from the accused in which threats were made to her. Mr Kelly had no previous convictions.
"This all comes down to a family feud over a house," defence solicitor Evan Moore said. Mr Kelly's mother had died and left wishes that the house be divided between the accused and his three siblings, Mr Moore said.
The father requested that the house go to Mr Kelly's sister and the argument had been going on for eight years.
The accused had too much to drink on the night and when he got home, he "passed out on the couch" and did not remember making the calls.
However, he accepted that he did. He was "very stressed out" over the argument and it "all boiled over and got to him."
Mr Kelly was very apologetic for what he did. He had never been in trouble before.
Judge Smyth said it was a serious matter to make threats of this nature.
Mr Moore said there had not been any interaction between Mr Kelly and his sister since and "if there is going to be anything, it will be a legal battle."

A Dublin man has admitted attacking his neighbour with a wooden brush and breaking his nose.
Michael Gaffney (31) struck the man several times in the face in an assault at an apartment building in the north of the city.
He was sent forward for sentence when he appeared in Dublin District Court.
Gaffney, with an address at Court View, Castle Avenue, Clontarf, is charged with assault causing harm and producing a wooden brush in the course of a dispute on May 5 last year.

Planning permission for 600 apartments in €107m RTE site deal is quashed by High Court

Planning permission has been quashed for a massive development on part of the RTÉ campus in Dublin 4 after a judicial review taken by local residents.
Last September, developer Cairn Homes secured fast-tracked planning permission for 611 apartments as well as town houses, cafés and childcare facilities on the site.
Cairn paid RTÉ €107.5m for the 8.7 acre site in 2017 - one of the steepest prices paid for property since the boom.
Challenge
Cairn Homes was granted full planning permission by An Bord Pleanála in September 2020. However, three residents living close to the development applied for and were granted leave for judicial reviews by the High Court.
The residents have also taken a constitutional challenge against the Government's Strategic Housing Development planning legislation - which allows for fast-track planning of big residential schemes.
Yesterday An Bord Pleanála advised the High Court that it will consent to an order quashing the decision to grant the planning permission due to a recently identified internal administrative issue relating to its processing of the application.
Cairn Homes has said the Montrose scheme was not due to begin work this year and it is expected to reapply for the same planning - the details of which were not at issue.
The developer originally planned to build around 500 units on the site but, as part of a successful pre-planning consultation with An Bord Pleanála that concluded in 2019, increased the scope of its design and layout.
Applying under the State's strategic housing rules - permitted for proposed developments offering more than 100 residential units - can bypass local authority scrutiny and receive a quicker ruling.
The proposed development includes 611 apartments, three townhouses, two cafes and a creche.
A protected structure, Mount Errol House, would be converted into a residential facility and public space, while adjoining stables would become a cafe.

We're now facing six more weeks lockdown

The country could be in lockdown for another six weeks under plans being considered by the Government as the more infectious UK strain of Covid-19 takes a stronger grip.
Ahead of a Cabinet Committee on Covid-19 next week it has emerged ministers are considering an extension of the highest level of coronavirus regulations until just before St Patrick's Day.
It comes as chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan warned last night the UK strain, which is easier to catch, is now at 60pc of cases and growing.
Surged
Worryingly, the spread of Covid-19 has also surged in nursing homes and other long-term care centres in the last three weeks to levels not seen since the first wave last March and April.
Up to January 19 there were 483 deaths and of those 55 were linked to outbreaks in hospital settings and another 155 to outbreaks in residential facilities, of whom 139 were residents of nursing homes.
Such a move by Government would mean non-essential retail will remain closed and household visits will continue to be banned until into the second week of March.
Ministers will examine reopening schools and construction but all other aspects of the economy and society are expected to remain closed until March at the earliest.
One Government source suggested schools may not have fully returned before that date.
It comes as Northern Ireland announced plans to extend their national lockdown until March 5.
Three senior Government sources said ministers will next week consider extending the lockdown for between four and six weeks. The sources said the Government was leaning towards six rather than four weeks of Level 5 restrictions.
However, a fourth Government source involved in the discussion said they expected restrictions to be extended for another four weeks beyond January 31.
The Cabinet Committee on Covid-19 will meet on Monday ahead of a full Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
Concern
There is concern about giving the public a date of when restrictions will be eased as people tend to change their behaviour in the weeks before a lockdown ends.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the Government was "nowhere near" ready to start easing restrictions as the virus was still rampant in the community. "Things are starting to fall slightly in terms of cases and hospitalisations but not at the pace we would like," Mr Varadkar told the Dáil.
Details of the extension of the third national lockdown come as 2,608 new cases of Covid-19 were reported along with 51 deaths.
Dr Holohan warned that the "existing measures are working in terms of control of transmission but we need to see them working for a much longer period of time."
Professor Philip Nolan, who tracks the virus, said when the new UK variant becomes dominant it will add to the R number and it will be "slightly more difficult to maintain the levels of transmission we are seeing now".
Prof Nolan said levels of infection had fallen in all age groups except in people over 65 but it is growing among those over 85 which will lead to significant deaths.
Health officials warned last night that the level of infection is still extremely high and 10 times higher than it was at the beginning of December.
The number of deaths this month has now risen to 532 and Dr Holohan said he still predicts there could be up to 1,000 deaths from the virus this month.
The R number, which indicates how fast the virus is spreading, is at 0.5 to 0.8 and it needs to be kept under 1.
Hospitals which are continuing to struggle with 1,943 Covid-19 patients, 214 of whom are in intensive care, are having to rely more on surge beds.
Asked about the reopening of schools in February Dr Holohan said education and health service continued to be priorities and the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) had given advice to Government.
"While we know we have made substantial progress relative to where we were in the late days of December and early January, we are nowhere near close to where we need to be," he said.

A 48-year-old woman needed life-saving surgery after she was stabbed in the neck during an attempted robbery in Dublin city centre.
The incident happened at 9.30pm on Wednesday near the CHQ building at Custom House Quay.
A lone male on a bicycle approached the woman, who was walking home from work, and demanded money from her.
He then stabbed her in the neck without warning before fleeing empty-handed.
Despite her serious injuries, which resulted in consider- able loss of blood, the woman was able to call the emergency services from her mobile phone.
Savage
Gardaí and ambulance personnel arrived quickly on the scene and the victim was stabilised before being rushed to the Mater Hospital, where she had to undergo life-saving surgery.
No arrests have yet been made, but gardaí said the area, which is home to many office buildings, is covered by "excellent quality CCTV" and they expect to make prompt progress with their investigation.
"This lady is very, very lucky to be alive," a source said. "This was a very savage crime.
"The woman didn't even put up a fight and presented no threat to him.
"It was deserted at the time because of all the restrictions."
Detectives are investigating if the attack is linked to two other robberies carried out in recent days in the Talbot Street area of the north inner city.

'I'll be back' - Trump's vow after 4 years of mayhem

Donald Trump left Washington for the final time yesterday morning with a melancholy farewell - and a vow to return to the political arena.
Although he had imagined a showy military send-off, those dreams were dashed as only a modest crowd of a few hundred aides and loyalists showed up at Joint Base Andrews to see him off.
"This is a great, great country. It is my greatest honour and privilege to have been your president," Mr Trump said, as his audience chanted: "Thank you, Trump."
"I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening," Mr Trump added.
"And I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better. I wish the new administration great luck and great success.
Spectacular
"I think they'll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular."
As he concluded his remarks, he vowed: "We will be back in some form. Have a good life."
Mr Trump and first lady Melania boarded Air Force One shortly before 9am for their final flight on the presidential aircraft, en route to West Palm Beach, Florida.
They will take up residence in Palm Beach at Mr Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club.
For all his love of a spectacle, yesterday's farewell event had more of a feel of a county fair than a big-budget extravaganza.
In a Trumpian twist, the music that played as he ended his remarks was the Village People's YMCA, a sing-along staple from his boisterous political rallies.
Then, as Air Force One began to roll on the tarmac, Frank Sinatra's My Way blared from the loudspeakers.
Guests included outgoing White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, for- mer White House physician and now Representative Ronny Jackson and other current and former aides including former press secretary Sean Spicer.
The Trumps were also joined by members of his family, including daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both senior White House advisers.
Noticeably absent from the send-off were the three elected Republicans who had worked most closely with him - vice president Mike Pence, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.
All three instead attended Joe Biden's inauguration, which Mr Trump decided not to attend, bucking the traditional transfer of power.
On a chilly winter morning, Mr Trump and the first lady walked out of the White House residence for the final time.
The president told reporters that serving had been the "honour of a lifetime", and as he said farewell he noted that it hopefully would not be a long goodbye.
The Trumps then boarded Marine One, which lifted off the South Lawn at 8.17am and flew over a fortified city that looked like a war zone amid threats of another insurrection by Trump supporters.
Mr Trump released a farewell video on Tuesday in which he noted the arrival of a new administration and wished it luck, but did not mention Mr Biden by name, nor did he concede or directly address his own defeat.
Instead, he touted his record as president and declared that "the movement we started is only just beginning".
Mr Trump leaves as the nation reached the grim milestone of 400,000 dead, with tens of thousands more deaths expected before the corona- virus pandemic subsides.
A crowd of a few hundred supporters mostly filed in ahead of Mr Trump's arrival, standing shoulder to shoulder in front of the stage despite public health recommendations against close contact with others, even outdoors.
Most in the crowd wore face masks, a change from Trump campaign events and some high-profile gatherings at the White House dubbed super-spreader events.
In one of his final acts as president, Mr Trump granted pardons early yesterday morning to 143 people, including former White House strategist Stephen Bannon and other well-connected celebrities, as well as non-violent drug offenders.
However, despite his interest in doing so, Mr Trump ultimately did not pre-emptively pardon himself or members of his immediate family.
Accused
On the eve of Mr Trump's departure, Mr McConnell pointedly accused him of having provoked the violent mob that stormed the US Capitol on January 6.
Nonetheless, in his taped farewell address, Mr Trump tried to cast his presidency as one marked by a bipartisan spirit.
He condemned the violence but did not address his role in urging his supporters to march on the seat of the national legislature in his name.
He also did not retract his false claim that the November 3 election was rigged.
Mr Trump had announced earlier this month that he would not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in.
Mr Biden said the decision was one of the few things he and Mr Trump agreed on.

An all-American celebration in Co Louth for 'Cousin Joe'

The Stars and Stripes were flying across Co Louth yesterday to mark the inauguration of 'Cousin Joe' as the 46th president of the United States.
"It's really huge for our family, we are so proud and have a real sense of pride that one of our own, whose ancestors hail from the Wee County, is in the biggest office in the world," said Andrea McKevitt, who is believed to be a distant cousin.
It was an all-American affair "with cheeseburgers, hot dogs and French fries on the menu and Bruce Springsteen and Garth Brooks on in the background".
Euphoria
With parents Veronica and Martin, and sister Ciara, Andrea watched the inauguration from her home on the Cooley Peninsula in north Co Louth.
"There is a euphoria in the air. We will be Zooming to the rest of the clan and bursting with pride watching Cousin Joe being sworn into office," said Andrea, a member of Louth County Council.
"He will be a president for all US citizens, not just those who voted for him, and I believe this is a welcome change on the world stage.
"Joe has a strong affinity to Ireland and I think that was clear in his commitment to our country through the Brexit talks and his dedication to the Good Friday Agreement."
The question on everyone's lips is when will he be back in Cooley?
"There is no word on a visit just yet, but we're hopeful 2021 will see the return of Cousin Joe to the peninsula," Andrea added.
"There is no doubt that we will all be ready and waiting for him whenever he wishes to make a return visit."
Meanwhile, Mr Biden has an open invitation to visit his ancestral home near Carlingford.
The building is very close to Lily Finnegan's pub, which Mr Biden visited twice - in 2016 as vice president and then during a private visit in 2017 with his brother and other members of his family.
Mr Biden's great-great grandfather is understood to be Owen Finnegan, who was baptised in the Cooley parish in 1814 and emigrated to the United States in 1849.
The single-storey stone building is owned by Robbie Coan and his wife Aoife Curran.
Robbie said he and Aoife bought the house in 1994, and one of the previous owners was a Finnegan.
Thrilled
"We both are thrilled that Biden is now the new president of the USA," he said.
"We would be delighted to welcome Joe and his family back to Whitestown and show him around the remains of his ancestral home."
Robbie said they had no idea that either the old farmhouse and barn - which were on the land with their bungalow - had any connection to Mr Biden when they bought it.
Speaking about the prospect of a visit from Mr Biden, Robbie added: "We would absolutely welcome him back with open arms."

GAA to spend €71m on Croke Park hospitality and museum

The GAA is to spend an estimated €71m redeveloping Croke Park by expanding its conference and hospitality facilities and upgrading its museum.
It will mark the first large-scale construction works at the stadium since a major rejuvenation which started in 1991 and ended in 2005. That project cost more than €260m.
Croke Park is one of the largest stadiums in Europe and has a capacity for just over 82,000 spectators.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) is planning to lend the Gaelic Athletic Association about €35m to cover the cost of the latest redevelopment project.
Approved
A spokesman for the bank said that the loan has been approved in principle by the EIB's board of directors.
He said that legal negotiations are ongoing and that further details will be announced when the loan is signed.
However, the spokesman confirmed that the Croke Park project includes the redevelopment and expansion of conference facilities on the Cusack Stand side of the stadium, an upgrade of the GAA museum, and further development of GAA hospitality venues "around Croke Park". The GAA Museum opened in 1998.
"The expected EIB support will enable the GAA to strengthen business and sporting activity at Croke Park and increase economic opportunities in north Dublin in the context of the GAA's wide and influential role in Irish society and culture," the spokesman said.
Supporting
He said that the GAA was "Ireland's largest sporting organisation supporting cultural and sporting life at 2,200 clubs across all 32 counties in Ireland and one of the great amateur sporting associations in the world".
The loan will be made to the GAA on a long-term basis.
"EIB support for the pioneering GAA project builds on a long track record of supporting urban development and economic development across Ireland, including recent initiatives to respond to challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit," the bank's spokesman added.
The GAA has had to stall a number of development projects around the country due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Hitting all the right notes as sisters' app sends a musical virtual hug to loved ones

Today is International Hugging Day, but with lockdown things just aren't the same.
Two Irish sisters have come up with a way to send a musical virtual hug to warm the heart of a loved one, filling the gap until we can squeeze each other properly again.
Just like popular video-calling app Zoom, their app, Huggnote, was conceived long before the coronavirus struck but has come into its own in these socially distanced times.
It allows users to send a song to capture emotions, along with a personal message for the recipient.
Sisters Jacqui and Perry Meskell, from Limerick city, came up with the idea over three years ago when Jacqui was working in Brussels.
A friend was going through a difficult time and a song came on the radio that suddenly brought back happy college memories for Jacqui.
"It was Fuzzy by Grant Lee Buffalo," she revealed, laughing that the song had transported her back in time and she wanted to share that feeling with her friend.
However, she realised there was no way to send it in a way that felt special.
"I ended up emailing her a link to the song on YouTube," Jacqui said, adding that she had wanted it to be a nicer experience.
With Jacqui's background in media and Perry's qualification in tech commercialisation and business administration, Huggnote fell into place.
"We couldn't believe that no smart guy in Silicon Valley hadn't already come up with this," Jacqui said.
Presenting
Now, Huggnote has hundreds of thousands of users in 205 countries and was the only Irish company to win a Mozilla 'Fix the Internet' Builders Award - helping to rectify the often toxic atmosphere online.
"When you send someone a song, you're presenting your authentic self in a way that can even make you feel a little bit vulnerable," Jacqui said.
The most popular song sent by Huggnote users is Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You.

January's Covid-19 death toll hits 485 after a further 61 fall victim to virus

January is among the darkest months yet for Covid-19 deaths, with the fatality toll rising to 485 as the virus claimed the lives of 61 more people yesterday.
The youngest person reported to have died from Covid-19 yesterday was 45, while the oldest was 100.
Hospitals are increasingly relying on surge intensive care beds to care for the sickest patients, although there are hopes admissions will slow down before they reach the limit.
The number of Covid-19 hospitalised patients fell slightly to 1,923 yesterday, while new patients admitted in the previous 24 hours went down to 85 from an average of around 120.
However, there are 210 seriously ill patients in intensive care - including a significant number in younger age groups.
Although there are increasing signs the lockdown is working, the daily number of new cases rose to 2,488 yesterday, up from 2,001 on Tuesday.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: "The number of cases and deaths that we are reporting today and the persisting high incidence rate of Covid-19 across the country shows that we cannot underestimate the highly infectious nature of this disease and the impact that it can have on families and communities.
"The virus spreads through close contacts, through the congregation of people.
"We need everyone to stay at home as much as possible, and to work from home, where possible.
Caring
"You should not meet up with friends or loved ones, unless you are caring for them.
"If you go out for exercise, you need to stay within 5km from your home, wear a face covering where appropriate and wash your hands when you return home to protect yourself from infection."
Meanwhile, an independent review has been ordered by the Coombe maternity hospital in Dublin into how the relatives of a number of staff were given the Covid-19 vaccine.
The hospital said its board had met to discuss the issue, which arose late in the evening of Friday, January 8, in relation to the vaccine roll-out.
"Given the serious nature of the matter the board has made the decision to commence an independent review. It expects this review will be completed within a number of weeks," a spokesperson said.
"The board has also taken the decision to task a senior clinician from within the hospital to lead and take full responsibility for the next stage of its vaccination roll-out until it is completed."
Earlier this week it emerged 16 family members of staff were given the vaccine after vaccinators could not find other health workers to receive leftover jabs.
The hospital said that on Friday January 8, at around 9pm, 16 vaccine doses were available and if they were not used then they would have had to have been discarded.
"At that time, the HSE booking system and portal was not live as it came online the following morning and so it was not possible to pre-book vaccinations and therefore be certain of the number of vaccinations required. The HSE booking system and portal is now live.
"That evening there were 16 vaccine doses that had been made up remaining, and to ensure that vaccines were not wasted they were administered to family members of employees of the hospital.
"Of the 16 recipients, nine were over 70 and the remaining seven were of varying age."
Session
It has also emerged that two relatives of staff in the Rotunda Hospital were given leftover vaccine.
New guidelines in place since last week state that a vaccination session must have a reserve list of staff who could be offered leftover vaccines.
A spokesman for Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said last night he had spoken to the chair of the hospital board and "noted their intention to carry out a full review".
He said Mr Donnelly welcomes the decision to have a senior clinician leading the next roll-out.

Mayor slams co-living project on Kiely's site

Dublin's Lord Mayor has said she was surprised to see a builder being granted planning permission for a co- living development on the site of Kiely's pub in Donnybrook, considering a ban on such developments has been signed into law.
Dublin City Council granted permission for the project subject to certain conditions, but Lord Mayor Hazel Chu, who had objected to the development, has said she would like to see the matter go before An Bord Pleanála.
The ban on co-living developments, where residents share some living space, was signed into law last Decem- ber 22.
Suitable
While developer Westridge applied for its planning permission before that date, Ms Chu said the development should not have been given the green light because construction had not yet started on it.
"The ban should mean that no co-living development should be built after that date, not just ones that are applied for after that date," Ms Chu said.
"If a decision has been made that such accommodation models are not suitable, then why should we allow any to be built if they have not already been started?
"We do have a lack of supply of housing, and we do need to build more homes, and that can include this site, but we need to build good-sized units for individuals and families, and I don't think the co-living model provides that.
"The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us that such a model is not suitable in the future either."
Dublin City Council gave a scaled-back plan for 85 units by Westridge the green light despite more than 100 objections.
Westridge bought the landmark Kiely's pub for more than €5m in 2019.

No vaccine queue jumping as doctors call for patience

Patients are being warned that GPs will have "zero discretion" in the pecking order for Covid-19 vaccinations amid phone calls to surgeries asking for injections.
Dr Denis McCauley, chair of the Irish Medical Organisation's GP committee, said anyone who is not on the priority list to be vaccinated will be told "no" and that discretion shown in the past in relation to flu vaccinations will not be repeated.
"The vaccines will be given out as per the risk groups, with zero discretion to give to any other groups," he said.
"We want to do this efficiently, ethically and quickly.
"If someone who is 85 comes in and has an elderly carer but the carer doesn't fit the criteria, are we going to give them the vaccine? No, we can't.
"We have to be very tight on this. This is a very finite resource."
Drawing
Discretion shown in the past with regard to the flu vaccine could not be applied with the Covid-19 vaccine, he added.
"That's not going to happen this time. We intend to do this as ethically as possible so we do need people's understanding."
Dr McCauley said GPs are in the process of drawing up lists, according to priority groups, of who they will vaccinate.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will be supplied to GPs in batches of 100.
Concerns raised over distribution issues that arose with the flu vaccine earlier this year are being addressed with the cold chain supply service.
The only limiting factor to accelerating the national roll-out, said Dr McCauley, will be the supply of vaccines coming into the country.
"If the supply is there, we hope to help accelerate the national roll-out," he said.
"We are used to giving vaccines. If a million vaccines are distributed to GPs in the middle of February, let's just say by St Patrick's Day we will be looking for more."
It is understood the requirement for a 15-minute observation period after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could mean some GPs will have to reconfigure their surgeries to create space.
"The supervision period after the AstraZeneca vaccine is still being looked at," said Dr McCauley.
Imagine
"In the UK there have been so few problems with it that they have dispensed with the 15-minute observation period, but I imagine there will be a more careful approach here in the beginning.
"We are starting at the 15-minute period - but if the European Medicines Agency says five minutes, all the better.
"The actual space needed to do the injection is very small. Everyone will have their owns solution but one recommendation is that the injection is given in the waiting room and the observation is completed in a consultation room.
"There are ways and means around it."
Dr McCauley said GPs were already receiving calls from patients asking them when they could receive the vaccine.
"We know there is huge interest in getting this vaccine, but we need people to be patient," he said.
"We will be contacting patients in due course to invite them to be vaccinated and we will waste no time once we have vaccines in our fridges."

President takes aim at climate and immigration

In one of his first official acts, President Joe Biden was yesterday returning the US to the worldwide fight to slow global warming and launched a series of climate-friendly efforts.
"A cry for survival comes from the planet itself," Mr Biden said in his inaugural address.
"A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now."
Mr Biden was signing an executive order rejoining the Paris climate accord within hours of taking the oath of office, fulfilling a campaign pledge.
The move undoes the US withdrawal ordered by predecessor Donald Trump, who belittled the science behind climate efforts, loosened regulations on heat-trapping oil, gas and coal emissions, and spurred oil and gas leasing in the pristine Arctic tundra and other wilderness.
The Paris accord commits 195 countries and other signatories to come up with a goal to reduce carbon pollution and monitor and report their fossil fuel emissions.
The US is the world's second biggest carbon emitter after China.
Mr Biden will also use executive orders to start undoing other climate roll-backs.
He will order a temporary moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in what had been virgin Arctic wilderness, direct federal agencies to start looking at tougher mileage standards and other emission limits again, and revoke Mr Trump's approval for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline.
After Mr Biden notifies the UN by letter of his intention to rejoin the Paris accord, it would become effective in 30 days, UN spokesman Alex Saier said.
Rejoining the Paris accord could put the US on track to cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 40pc to 50pc by 2030, experts said.
Also within hours of being sworn in, Mr Biden sent an immigration bill to lawmakers that would open a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the US unlawfully, a sharp contrast to the policies of Mr Trump.
Mr Biden was signing 15 executive actions last night, at least six of those dealing with immigration, making the issue a major focus of the Democratic president's first day in office.
The actions included immediately lifting a travel ban on more than a dozen Muslim-majority and African countries, halting construction of the US-Mexico border wall and reversing an order preventing migrants who are in the US illegally from being counted when US congressional voting districts are next redrawn.
Mr Biden will also sign a memorandum directing the Department of Homeland Security and the US attorney general to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme, which protects migrants who entered the country as children from deportation, and reverse Mr Trump's executive order calling for stricter interior immigration enforcement.
The new president is also expected to end a Trump programme called the Migrant Protection Protocols.
The programme has left tens of thousands of asylum seekers waiting in Mexico for US court hearings, with many stuck for months in tent camps near the US border.
Taken together, the actions show Mr Biden is beginning his presidency with a sharp focus on immigration, just as Mr Trump kept the issue at the centre of his policy agenda until the last days of his administration.

The public spotlight is once again on RTÉ's finances after it published its list of top earners for 2017, 2018 and 2019.
The last time it released this information was in December 2018 and it only covered up to the year ending 2016.
It reveals that RTÉ Radio 1 presenters Ryan Tubridy, Ray D'Arcy and Joe Duffy have remained the top three highest-earning presenters at the broadcaster for the time period covered.
Most of those named on its best-paid list are contractors - whose services are hired out by RTÉ - and the figure listed does not include VAT.
They must file their own tax returns and make their own pension contributions, while RTÉ employees are paid salaries and related benefits.
Maintained
The latest list comes in the wake of reports that emerged last week that the national broadcaster had made a net loss of €7.2m in 2019.
Earning annual fees of €495,000 for The Late Late Show and his morning radio programme, Tubridy has maintained his top spot on the list since 2014.
From 2017-2019, Ray D'Arcy's annual earnings for presenting his radio and TV show came to €450,000, while in third position is Liveline anchor Joe Duffy.
In 2019, his fees came to €392,494, a slight drop on the previous year when it was listed as nearly €405,000.
In fourth position, and previously the best-paid female broadcaster until her sudden passing last January, was Marian Finucane, whose fees were just over €358,000 in 2019.
Sean O'Rourke, who retired in May of 2020, was fifth on the list with his earnings of €327,988.
Number six on the list is Prime Time anchor and RTÉ Radio 1 weekend presenter Miriam O'Callaghan, who earned €320,000 in 2019 and a similar figure in 2018.
Sean O'Rourke's replacement, Claire Byrne, is number seven on the list and her salary was the same for 2019 and 2018, standing at €250,000.
RTÉ has not released its best-paid presenter list for 2020, with Byrne having taken over the weekday mid-morning slot on Radio 1 last September - so it is not known how her fees compare now with those that were paid to O'Rourke.
Journalist and broadcaster Brendan O'Connor came in as a new entrant at number eight, according to the figures for 2018 and 2019. His fees came to €240,000 in 2019 and €220,000 the previous year for his radio and TV work.
Bryan Dobson was number nine on the list in 2018 and 2019, earning just over €209,000, while in 10th position is Radio 1's Mary Wilson, who was a new entrant in 2019, earning just over €196,000.
Commenting on the release, RTÉ said fees paid to its top 10 presenters represent less than 1pc of its overall operating costs and RTÉ say salaries are under "constant review."
Meanwhile, news of the salary disclosures angered TDs on the Dáil's media committee. Sinn Féin's Imelda Munster said the public would be rightly sickened to read of such salaries when hundreds of thousands were out of work and on welfare.
Justify
"You can't justify such huge salaries, year-in and year-out, and on this scale," she said.
It is very hard to take RTÉ seriously when they come pleading poverty and looking for funding when they are paying these outrageous amounts and failing to get their own house in order."
Another member of the committee, Independent TD Mattie McGrath, said it was "distastefully sly of RTÉ... to have purposefully published the extraordinary high salaries during the primetime coverage of the US presidential inauguration.
In relation to publishing the figures on inauguration day, RTÉ said in a statement that "on any given day there are very significant news events" and it had "committed to publishing details in January 2021".

Teachers and SNAs face tests in bid to settle school row

Fresh efforts are under way to get the partial re-opening of schools back on track, after a day of recriminations over who was to blame for the failure to start the phased return of pupils with special needs from today.
As talks continue, the Government may offer to test all teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) in an attempt to reopen schools for children with special needs.
However, it is expected that antigen tests will be used rather than the more accurate PCR testing.
The move comes after union chiefs asked to have all children and staff in special schools tested for Covid-19 as a condition of returning to work.
The union Fórsa, which represents SNAs, put forward the proposal during talks.
Compromise
While it had concerns over the accuracy of antigen tests, the union was open to using them.
However, it is understood the proposal was rejected by the Department of Education as it was believed the testing would be too invasive for children with special needs.
But testing for staff may offered as a compromise.
The department also continued to insist public health advice on Covid-19 says schools are safe environments for teachers and students when compared with other workplaces.
Education Minister Norma Foley yesterday met management bodies in the primary sector to get their views on re-opening.
Today her department is engaging with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) and Fórsa.
Moves aimed at staggering the return of 23,000 pupils had ended in controversy on Tuesday night when Ms Foley abandoned the plan because of a lack of co-operation from the unions.
At the heart of union opposition is a fear among members of returning at a time of high levels of Covid-19 infection.
The collapse led to calls on Taoiseach Micheál Martin in the Dáil to intervene, with claims that the ministers involved had "lost control" of the situation.
Meanwhile, families of children with special needs are seeking a meeting with Mr Martin to press for urgent supports to help them while schools remain closed to their children.
Four advocacy organisations said the issue was "moving of the realm of education" and they were "facing a welfare and wellbeing crisis for these children and their families".
AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland, Family Carers Ireland and Inclusion Ireland expressed deep disappointment at the failure to re-open schools for children with special needs.
"The latest news on the continued closure of schools for children with special educational needs is another cruel blow to families," they said. But while efforts to re-open schools continued, they said urgent additional supports were required for the children and families affected to avert a child wellbeing crisis.
Meanwhile, Ms Foley is facing pressure on another related front with a survey showing that four in five Leaving Cert students want a choice between calculated grades and sitting June exams this year.
The first preference of over half of the students - 55pc - is to have that flexibility and the figure rises to 81pc when second preferences are included.
Only 4pc of students - one in 25 - voted for the conventional exams as their top option in the Irish Second Level Students Union (ISSU) survey.
The appetite for change from tradition in 2021 has emerged in responses from more than 20,000 students in 480 post-primary schools, including more than 13,000 sixth years.
Leaving Cert candidates have already suffered severe disruption to their education as a result of Covid and there is no certainty about when they will return to school.

'Ignore anti-vaxxers, this jab is a triumphant moment in battle with a terrible virus'

Mr X, a man in his sixties who was otherwise healthy for his age, did not believe that Covid-19 would affect him personally.
Sure, he acknowledged that the virus was real but he was angry at the lockdowns and resentful that his once-normal way of life had been transformed into an unpleasant experience, replete with endless restrictions.
He continued to act as if the storm had passed. He refused to wear a mask and he continued to socialise.
"It won't happen to me," he thought, fully displaying the cognitive bias known as optimism bias.
It all began with a dry cough. "It'll pass. Winter is upon us and the dry air irritates my sinuses."
But it would not go away. Instead, the dry cough became a heaviness in the chest. Breathless, Mr X began gasping faster and faster.
His lips turned blue and fear washed over his body as sweat descended from his brow. No matter how much he pulled air into his lungs, he felt like he was suffocating.
Now his chest burned with each heaving breath.
Denial gave way to reality: "Take me to the hospital."
It was not long before Mr X was intubated and placed on a ventilator.
Painful
His chest X-ray looked like a violent snowstorm, with white patches taking the place of the normally black air-filled spaces. Tubes were inserted into every orifice and painful cannulas were placed in his neck and his wrist to administer medications and monitor vital parameters.
Despite applying the latest evidence-based practice, Mr X took a turn for the worse. Another victim of this terrible pandemic.
I am a junior anaesthetist and intensive care doctor working on the frontline. Multiple times a day, I don the cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) - the last stand I have against this horrible pathogen.
Every time I encounter such a patient, either to examine them or to perform a procedure on them, I elevate my risk of acquiring the infection. It is anxiety-provoking and exhausting.
However, I experienced a glimmer of hope last week when I received the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine - a truly triumphant moment for science over this pandemic.
This vaccine uses a small piece of messenger RNA - the molecule that provides the instructions for how to assemble a protein - inserted into a lipid molecule.
Once injected, the lipid molecules bind to our cells and release the messenger RNA into the cell. Following this, the messenger RNA is read by our cell's protein-making machinery, leading to the production of the coronavirus spike protein.
This protein is then exposed to our immune cells, resulting in the production of antibodies (and immune memory) against the spike protein.
If all goes well, should the real virus enter our bodies, our immune systems already know what to look for and know how to defeat it.
Vaccines are akin to a sports team training before the big match day; they allow the immune system to practise before encountering the opposition, much like a rugby team runs through training drills and rehearses their playbook before they encounter their rivals.
It is extremely important to highlight that this vaccine does not contain the live Covid-19 virus; this vaccine cannot give you Covid-19.
It represents a truly ingenious counterstrike by the scientific community.
But despite the well-documented vaccine efficacy across age-groups, sexes, different ethnicities and individuals with coexisting medical conditions, there is a large and loud troupe of anti-vaxxers hell-bent on pushing nefarious misinformation.
After I had received my jab, I experienced no immediate side effects and continued to work. It did not hurt when I received the vaccine and in the following days, the only side effect I experienced was a very mild discomfort at the injection site.
Normality
What I got in return is the peace of mind that I am doing everything I can to prevent this virulent entity from infecting my body and infecting others around me, as well as taking steps towards returning to normality.
This does not mean that I will stop wearing PPE or flout the lockdown rules - on the contrary, there is no guarantee that I will be 100pc protected from Covid-19.
Human beings are variable in many respects - our faces, eye colour, personalities and also our immune systems.
Not everyone will behave in the same way. To make matters more complicated, the virus itself is a dynamic entity, able to mutate.
Precautions still need to be taken - but I will sleep easier knowing that I have reduced my risk by receiving this jab.
Life is about reasoning under uncertainty. Everything we do involves risk, whether it be driving a car, boarding a plane or shopping during the pandemic.
In medicine, we are taught that there is no effect without side effect - paracetamol, for example, can render a headache more manageable but there is a risk that it damages your liver. In most instances, we perform simple cost-benefit analyses.
In this case, the benefits clearly outweigh any associated costs or harms.
I would encourage everyone to receive their vaccine when the opportunity arises.
This will not be the panacea we all hope for, but will go some way towards bringing back our cherished normal way of life.
The unsung heroes of this pandemic have been the amazing nurses who spend prolonged periods of time in high-risk environments caring for Covid-19 patients.
I am deeply grateful to them for all their help and support. We owe it to them to do everything we can to prevent this disease. It is not too late.
Humanity has faced countless challenges in our collective history. We will get through this but it will require buy-in from society at large. These vaccines take us one step closer to victory over this pandemic.
I hope this inspires others to take up the life-saving jabs as the vaccine becomes more widely available.

Biden's Irish cousins sad to miss event but 'very excited'

It's a time of great pride tinged with disappointment for President-elect Joe Biden's Mayo relatives.
Due to Covid-19 and the heightened security situation in the US, the Blewitts from Knockmore can't take up their inauguration invitations.
Like the rest of the world, Mr Biden's cousins will watch his inauguration as the 46th US president on television.
Prior to the storming of Capitol Hill by supporters of Donald Trump on January 6, the Blewitts were among the few to be invited to Washington event.
"We are disappointed, of course, but we will have our own party here at home," said Joe Blewitt.
"The kids are decorating the house and they're very excited. It will be great to see it happening."
The fact all Biden supporters will have to watch the historic event at home saddens the family.
"With all the security they have to have in place in Washington, it's an awful shame people won't be able to line the streets and wish him well.
Dedicated
"He has dedicated his life to public service, so it's obviously a huge day for him, but it's sad for his supporters they can't come out and show their support."
Since he was elected, Mr Biden has referenced his Mayo roots several times, including during his first phone call with Taoiseach Micheál Martin just days after he was declared the election winner.
Mr Biden spoke at length about his Irish connections and mentioned Mayo's win against Roscommon in the Connacht Football Championship the previous Sunday.
Just two weeks ago, he announced fellow Irish-American and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh as the next US Secretary of Labour.
Praising Mr Walsh's credentials for the role, Mr Biden joked: "(He's) the son of Irish immigrants - the only downside is they aren't from Mayo, they're from Galway."
President-elect Biden is five-eighths Irish. On his paternal side, his great-great-grandfather emigrated from Knockmore, Co Mayo in the 19th Century, aged 18.
His mother, Catherine 'Kitty' Jean Finnegan's great-grandfather emigrated from the Cooley peninsula in Co Louth in 1850.
Mr Biden visited Ireland in June 2016, accompanied by both his children and grandchildren.
He spent several days with the Blewitts, who remain in regular contact with the Biden family.
"He values the Irish connection, and we certainly think the world of him," said Mr Blewitt.
The Ballina-based plumber said his family have plans to visit Washington when restrictions ease.
"We will definitely get over to see him at some stage during his term, and I really can't wait to bring the kids over. It's very exciting for them."

Donnelly hits out at Harris over jab remarks

Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has rebuked his predecessor Simon Harris over suggestions there is no protocol in place for "spare" Covid-19 vaccines.
The Herald has learned Mr Donnelly indirectly hit out at Mr Harris at the Cabinet meeting yesterday while updating ministers on the latest developments with the roll-out.
The Fianna Fáil  minister was said by sources at the meeting to have reminded colleagues that the Cabinet had discussed in detail and signed off on the vaccination plan before Christmas.
While he did not directly address Mr Harris, one source said: "It wasn't that subtle."
On Monday, Mr Harris raised concerns about the lack of clear protocols around how spare vaccine doses are used following controversy over the Coombe Hospital giving 16 vaccines to family members of staff.
Speaking at Government Buildings, the Higher Education Minister said he would be very concerned if there was not a protocol in place for what should be done with leftover vaccine doses.
Miffed
"Either this is a situation in place, where there is a protocol about what you do with so-called spare vaccines and that wasn't followed, or more concerning if there isn't a protocol in place," the Fine Gael minister said.
Mr Donnelly was said by one Cabinet colleague to have been "a bit miffed" by the comments and implied this annoyance when addressing the issue of leftover vaccines at the weekly Government meeting.
The Cabinet source said: "It was put forward pretty forcefully, he just said there has been some public comment about lack of clarity around protocols - but let's be clear there are protocols, anyone who needs assistance can contact him directly."
A second Cabinet source described it as an "indirect" rebuke, but said it was clear to those in the room what Mr Donnelly "was getting at".

Jab deal with GPs at double UK cost labelled 'good value'

The Government has defended as "very good value" the decision to pay GPs in Ireland more than double their UK counterparts to administer Covid-19 vaccines.
Cabinet yesterday approved a plan to pay GPs and pharmacists almost €91m to vaccinate 1.5 million people in the coming months.
Under the deal, GPs and pharmacists will be paid €25 for administering each dose of the vaccine with an additional one-off €10 processing fee per patient, meaning a GP or pharmacist will get €60 for giving two doses of vaccines and €35 for one dose. GPs working in mass vaccination centres will be paid €120 per hour.
Deliver
In the UK, the NHS agreed late last year to pay GPs £12.58 (€14) to deliver a dose of the vaccine, which amounts to around €28 for two doses.
The two vaccines approved for use in the Irish market, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, both require two doses as does the easier-to-store Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that GPs and pharmacists are expected to deliver once regulatory approval is granted.
A Government spokesman said last night that "nobody has any issues with the fees, everyone's happy" and that given the cost to the State and the economy of the pandemic the cost of paying GPs "will prove very good value in the long run". He said: "It will prove good value whenever we see mass vaccine roll-out."
Dr Denis McCauley of the Irish Medical Organisation said: "The fee we agreed is what we agreed for the flu vaccine and there is an extra admin charge until the software is up and running."
Irish Pharmacy Union secretary general Darragh O'Loughlin said: "The fees being paid to pharmacists are reasonable in the context of the cost of delivering the service."
The HSE has been in talks with groups such as the St John Ambulance about taking part in the vaccination rollout.
It comes as Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan, and Health Minister Stephen Donnelly are to meet representatives of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee today to discuss the rollout of the vaccine so far.
Amid concern at the pace of vaccinations and anger over relatives of staff being vaccinated in Dublin's Coombe Hospital, Mr Donnelly said Ireland was still on target to hit 140,000 vaccinations by Sunday.

Motorists warned of flooding threat after Storm Christoph

Motorists and walkers were warned to take extreme care given torrential rainfall forecast for the past 24 hours as Storm Christoph swept past Ireland.
While we avoided the worst of the Atlantic storm - parts of Britain were expected to receive up to 200mm of rain on higher ground - there was still a likelihood of spot flooding and even flash floods in mountainous areas across the west and midlands.
Met Éireann issued a Status Yellow rainfall alert, which remained in place until 9pm last night. The alert was valid for Connacht, Longford, Louth, Westmeath, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan
Met Éireann's Linda Hughes warned that up to 50mm of rainfall could hit some low-lying areas - with even greater amounts along mountainous areas of Ireland.
Gardaí and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) urged those driving to and from work, as well as those undertaking essential journeys, to drive with caution given the possibility of spot-flooding and poor visibility.
With streams, rivers and lakes already heavily swollen with rainfall, walkers were urged to exercise extreme care near all waterways.
Outbreaks
"It will be very wet and breezy, with widespread outbreaks of rain, rain heavy and persistent over the northern half of the country with a risk of localised flooding," Ms Hughes said.
"The highest temperatures will generally be of 9C to 11C degrees but colder over Ulster - with highs of just 3C to 6C.
"Outbreaks of rain will continue in many areas tonight, turning to sleet at times over Ulster.
"There will be a pulse of heavy rain moving into southern coastal counties before dawn. It will hold mild in the south for much of the night but with much colder air to the north with lowest temperatures of 0C to 4C degrees."
The rain is set to ease up today, but the east will see some further heavy showers.
"Rain will become confined to the east and south where it will be heavy for a time near southeastern coasts," Ms Hughes said.
"The western half of the country will become bright with scattered wintry showers of rain or sleet."
Blustery showers will persist tonight, though temperatures could sink to -3C overnight.
Tomorrow will be a cool day with sunny spells, though there will be showers over the western half of the country, and some further east will bring a risk of hail.
Friday will see some sunny spells, but it will be cloudier in the south.

US Vice President Mike Pence is among those who will not be attending US President Donald Trump's sendoff event at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
A person familiar with Pence's schedule cited "logistical challenges" in getting from the air base to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration ceremonies on Wednesday.
Much of Washington, DC, is under lockdown, with thousands of National Guard troops on patrol and other security precautions in place.
The caution comes weeks after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to try to stop Congress from confirming Biden's victory.
Trump and Pence's relationship has been strained since Trump tried to pressure Pence to stop the election certification and Trump supporters roaming the Capitol chanted, "Hang Mike Pence!" after the president tweeted disapprovingly of him.
Trump will be only the fourth president in the nation's history not to attend his successor's inauguration.
He is boycotting the inauguration event and will be flying to Florida on Wednesday morning.
Pulled
Aides have been organizing an elaborate sendoff event, but it is unclear how many people were invited.
Among them is Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director who became a Trump critic.
He quipped on Twitter that he couldn't make it because he was "having my fingernails pulled out at that time".

Property prices rose nationally in November but are down in Dublin

Property prices rose slightly in November as the demand for homes outstrips supply.
Prices were up by 0.2pc nationally in the year to November, new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for property sales show.
This compares with a decrease of 0.5pc in the year to October.
Prices nationally rose by 0.4pc in the month of November compared with the previous month.
In Dublin, residential property prices saw a decline of 0.9pc in the year to November, while property prices outside Dublin were 1.2pc higher.
Outside Dublin, prices for houses were up by 1.1pc, and apartment prices were up by 1.9pc, the CSO said.
The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest rise in house prices was the South-East at 3pc. The Mid-West recorded a 4.3pc decline.
Statisticians said new properties rose in price in the July to September period, while the price of second-hand properties fell.
Construction of homes was halted during the first lockdown, leading to a shortage of new builds.
In November, 4,236 residential property purchases were filed with Revenue.
This represents a 6.1pc increase compared to the 3,991 purchases in November 2019. It is up 10.2pc compared with the 3,845 purchases in October last year.
The total value of transactions filed in November was €1.3bn.
According to the CSO, Revenue data shows that there were 1,438 first-time buyer purchases in November. This is an increase of 6.1pc on the 1,355 recorded in November 2019. These purchases were made up of 410 new dwellings and 1,028 existing dwellings.
Households paid a median, or typical, price of €258,000 for a dwelling in the year to last November. The Dublin region had the highest median price at €377,500.
Within the Dublin region, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown had the highest median price at €530,000, while South Dublin had the lowest at €350,000.
The highest median prices outside Dublin were Wicklow at €340,000 and Kildare €319,000. The lowest price was €108,000 in Longford.
The national property price index is now 16.9pc lower than its highest level in 2007.
Peak
Dublin residential property prices are 22.2pc lower than their February 2007 peak, while prices in the rest of Ireland are 19.2pc lower than their May 2007 peak.
A number of property experts predict prices will continue to rise this year.
Demand for property has not been hit by the pandemic as most of those out of work were not earning.
It is estimated that around 20,000 housing units will be built this year, but the Economic and Social Research Institute estimates there is demand for 28,000 units.
Economist with Goodbody Stockbrokers Dermot O'Leary said price rise trends were evident across the country, with annualised growth in the three months to end of November at 5pc.
"Alongside relatively robust demand, the supply of properties for sale is now at all-time lows, thus putting upward pressure on prices," he said.
Mr O'Leary said non-households, including local authorities, government-backed housing bodies and private investment funds, are snapping up property. He said 40pc of every new home is being purchased by non-households, rising to 50pc in Dublin.

Top Trump moments that have damaged reputation of States

There used to be a schoolyard card game called Top Trumps, with cards swapped over challenges in various categories, the highest number winning.
Donald Trump's four-year reign has instead involved the bar being set ever lower, with Ireland and the world repeatedly looking on flabbergasted and aghast as he exhibited his ignorance and capriciousness, seemingly sinking lower at every step.
Here are some of the Worst Trumps from his time in office, now guillotined at last by the accession of Joe Biden to the Oval Office.
1) The separation of mothers and babies at the border
Hundreds of children have still to be reunited with their parents after Trump authorised forcible separations of adults and children, aimed at discouraging families from crossing the Rio Grande on the southern US border.
The policy, which was implemented in 2017, was blamed on former attorney general Jeff Sessions and it was exacerbated by the deaths of two children - aged 7 and 8 - who had not been separated from their parents while in US custody.
Trump claimed it was an Obama policy, but he also induced fear in the undocumented Irish by urging ICE, the immigration force, to step up deportations.
2) The Capitol Hill insurrection
Trump might share with Osama Bin Laden the targeting for attack of the magnificent Capitol building - except that the domestic terrorists got through.
The hijackers of United 93, believed to have been headed for the US Capitol, were met by a passenger rebellion that brought the aircraft down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, in September 2001, killing all aboard.
Trump has now been impeached twice, and his Senate trial will hinge on his alleged incitement of the rioters.
3) Urging the injection of bleach to counter Covid
Everyone has seen the footage and the squirming of public health adviser Dr Deborah Birx as the president suggested a jab of Clorox, a brand of liquid bleach, under the skin could cure the virus. Some people followed Trump's advice and became very ill.
By not wearing a mask and failing to encourage social distancing, Trump has probably played a role in the infection of millions of Americans during a pandemic that has claimed many, many lives.
4) Backing Putin over his own intelligence chiefs
At a summit in Reykjavik, Trump humiliated his own security services by saying he was convinced by Vladimir Putin's reassurances that Russia did not try to interfere in the 2016 election that brought Trump to power.
The services, which have recently seen a cyber-attack on the US go without response, also claimed Russia had tried to interfere in the 2018 midterms and influence last November's poll.
Trump's whims in matters of foreign policy are also seen as encouraging like-minded narcissists like Kim Jong-un, who, far from backing off, is now announcing the planned construction and deployment of nuclear submarines.
5) Threatening Ukraine with the ending of defence aid if it did not find dirt on the Bidens
This was the appalling abuse of power that led to Trump's first impeachment, when he told the president of Ukraine that he wanted something in return for defence aid against Russian encroachment into the Crimea and backing for armed breakaway militias in eastern Ukraine, money the Congress had already voted to be spent.
What Trump asked for was dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter, and a public Ukrainian statement that it was investigating his company.
No such announcement came and the money was eventually paid over when the story leaked, with a related row over the attempted hiding of the transcript of the conversation on a secret secure White House server.
6) Pulling out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal
We might as well add 'undermining Nato' to this one.
Joe Biden has promised to instantly reverse Trump's decision to abandon the Paris deal, which was to guard against planetary overheating by 1.5C since industrial times, seen by many experts as the tipping point for irreversible weather chaos and sea rise.
Trump, of course, was trumpeting coal instead. On the far cleaner nuclear power plants and Iran's spinning off of enriched uranium for weaponised nukes, the inhabitant of the Oval Office ripped up years of patient work by his allies. And then assassinated an Iranian general.
7) Referring to 'shithole' countries
Not content with alienating his allies, other countries with potential goodwill were told where to get off by Trump.
This particular remark arose after criticism of his failure to help earthquake- and climate-ravaged countries, including Puerto Rico, a US territory. He told Senators (in a comment later denied): "Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"

This country would need four million migrants over the next 30 years to maintain the health of the State pension system.
The stark warning was made to the Government-appointed Pensions Commission.
It was told that the number of older people is rising fast, leaving a smaller proportion of those in work to fund the pensions of the over 65s.
Central Statistics Office statistician James Hegarty told a commission meeting: "The population of older age groups will increase, and this will have a significant impact on the ratio of working-age people to pensioners."
He said at a meeting in December that there are currently five working-age people to every one person over the age of 65.
Fertility
By the year 2051, this will fall to 2.3 people for every one person over 65. But Mr Hegarty said Ireland is still younger than most European countries.
This is due to the fact that fertility rates have just started to drop here recently, while they have been falling in the rest of Europe for a number of years.
This country is moving to the EU average with more older people and fewer younger people, Mr Hegarty said.
"To maintain the current ratio of five workers to one older person in 2051, it is estimated that an additional four million migrants would be needed," he told the commission.
The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (FCA) told the commission that currently, €850m a year is needed to cover pensions, and costs will grow.
FAC chair Sebastian Barnes said tax and spending would have to adjust to fund pensions, while the pension age would need to rise.
Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys spoke at the first meeting and said a reduction in the State pension was not to be considered.
The minister also emphasised the role of the State pension as the bedrock of the pension system and asked members to keep this in mind.

€100 a week for our student nurses 'a slap in the face' - SF to challenge issue in Dáíl

A €100-a-week award to student nurses by the Government has been rejected as insufficient and unfair.
The Dáil is today expected to hear protests from the Opposition over the gesture, with Sinn Féin planning to read out the testimonies of young nurses and midwives appalled by what they have seen and had to risk in the Covid-19 pandemic.
"They won't stay in this State and work in the healthcare service if they don't see fairness," warned David Cullinane, Sinn Féin's spokesman on health, yesterday.
"I don't believe that €100 is anywhere near a fair amount," he added.
The Government accepted a recommendation from Professor Tom Collins, chair of Dublin Institiute of Technology (DIT), that those on placement receive a pandemic grant for their otherwise-unpaid placements in hospitals, although final-year students had been getting €50 a week towards transport and meals.
The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) said its student representatives say the frontline situation has changed in the third wave - which caused placements of first to third year students to be suspended last weekend for the next fortnight.
The students have called on Health Minister Stephen Donnelly to return to a scheme similar to that of last March when the virus first struck.
This would mean healthcare assistant contracts for all students whose placements are suspended.
It would also move interns up to healthcare assistant pay (€10.70 an hour) in recognition of their increased workloads and risk.
They are also seeking clarity on what will happen to placements over the coming months.
Hollow
INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said: "They are thanked for their work so far, but the thanks ring hollow when their reasonable demands for fair remuneration go unanswered.
"There is still time for the minister to do the right thing: offer the students contracts as healthcare assistants to boost staffing and move up interns' pay to reflect their new workloads and risks.
"Our student members tell us they feel left up in the air.
"Last-minute decisions are being made about their placements, with no clear plan in place for the future.
"Many students tell us that they want to make a direct contribution to the fight against Covid, and are seeking healthcare assistant contracts while their placements are suspended."
A further Dáil motion on pay for student nurses is to be introduced today after the Government reaped heavy criticism for voting one down before Christmas.
Government backbenchers who experienced a public backlash on the issue complained at Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings that they had been left without effective speaking points on the issue of pay for student nurses.
Mr Cullinane said there now had to be negotiations between the Government and the representative bodies.
"They should sit down and work out what would be a fair amount."
But he said that any reasonable person looking at the workload and risks faced by student nurses would not agree that €100 a week was fair reward.
"It is anything but fair. It is a real slap in the face for student nurses and midwives."
Sinn Féin is to bring a motion to the Dáil today to ensure student nurses and midwives receive fair pay "without delay", he added.
Mr Cullinane said there was a staffing crisis in the health service, with more than 6,000 health workers out due to Covid-19.

'It went mad' - Anna's joy as kids clothing firm takes off

TV presenter Anna Daly has opened up about starting a new business in a pandemic and how she was gripped by self-doubt before its launch.
The Virgin Media star went live with her Little Bliss clothing company last month. A capsule collection of 12 sweatshirts for parents and children, she said her nerves were jangling before the December 2 launch.
The Ireland AM presenter is mother to Ben (9), Euan (7) and Rhys (4) and her own sons model some of the pieces in her collection.
"I was in two minds before Christmas about whether to wait until the New Year or to launch and go ahead with it," she admitted. "But I wanted to get it out there pre-Christmas, so I launched it on December 2 and thought it would be a slow build. But I haven't stopped packing boxes since the launch.
"You do have a moment where you go, 'Jesus, will everybody like it and want to wear it?' But it went mad as soon as I launched it.
"It's been a very rewarding process but not a very glamorous process. I am down at the depot in Greystones every day and they know I'm full of parcels every time I turn up.
Trolley
"They give me this postman's trolley and it couldn't be less glamorous. I pile up all the boxes and they get shipped off. But I never dreamed I would be in this position so quickly."
The presenter had a tough 2020, as her father battled prostate cancer. Thankfully, he is facing into a brighter future after undergoing intensive treatment.
"He would have gone into the Beacon every day for radiation during the first lockdown, which was a worry in itself," she said. "But he's through it and it's just about getting his strength back now. It's brilliant.
"I don't think he will ever be cancer-free but it will be managed, which is an OK place to be, given where we were. It was very typical for a man of his age, more common than I realised."
Daly is anxious for her elderly parents to receive the Covid-19 vaccination.
"I think we're all in a hurry to see our loved ones getting the vaccine. No matter how fast they go, we're going to get frustrated about the pace of it (vaccine rollout) because it's a matter of life or death for so many people."

'It's a huge honour' - Irish violinist to perform for Biden

Leading Irish violinist Patricia Treacy will play during a private mass for president-elect Joe Biden and his family before his inauguration tomorrow.
There had been concerns there would not be any live music at the mass because of the riot at the Capitol earlier this month.
The invitation for Patricia to play on inauguration day came directly to her from the Biden family last year.
She said: "I am going to be playing in the church with the family present."
Over the weekend, she practised in Chicago for what she described as "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity". The main piece she will be performing is The Proclamation composed by Patrick Cassidy.
Patricia will be playing a 315-year-old Stradivarius violin, from Joe Bein and Company in Chicago, estimated to be worth $4m (€3.3m).
She will also join Soprano Renée Fleming for On Eagle's Wings, Schubert's Ave Maria and the Celtic Alleluia.
"I have been told this will be the only live music event on the day," she added.
Patricia, from Co Louth, has played for the president-elect on a number of occasions, including when he visited his ancestral home in 2016. She was also asked to perform at some of the Biden rallies in Chicago and other cities.
When she was asked to play at the inauguration, she said: "I feel both honoured and privileged and obviously super excited."
Despite security concerns following the riot in Washington DC, Patricia said it has been confirmed she will be playing live.
It is understood the mass is private, with only immediate family present. Afterwards, Mr Biden and his family will make their way to the Capitol for the inauguration.
She said: "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be able to perform for the inaugural mass for the president-elect and his amazing family, which I have become very close to.
"I am hugely honoured to be a part of this momentous, historical occasion."
Patricia said her jewellery will be "diamonds and sapphires from Martin Katz Jewels in Beverly Hills".
He is known as the jeweller to the stars and his wife, Kelly, is the former chairman of the Kennedy Centre Board for the performing arts. Patricia performed for the board in September 2019.
Her blue dress is from Dimitra's, Chicago and was designed by Alex Teih. The colour complements the jewellery, which is worth $3m (€2.5m) and was transported to Patricia in an armoured car.

A football belonging to a 10-year-old girl which was swept away with the tide off the Waterford coast has turned up on a beach in Wales a week later.
Aoife Ní Niocaill watched helplessly as her Gaelic football got swept away with the strong waves on Woodstown beach in Dunmore East last Sunday.
However, a week later a local in the Welsh village of Llanrhystud issued a social media appeal after she found the ball, which luckily had Aoife's name written on it.
Taking to Facebook, Welsh woman Aline Denton wrote: "If anyone knows Aoife Ní Niocaill, her football's just washed up on Llanrhystud beach - West Wales! Wonder how long it's taken to get here from Ireland?"
Within hours, over 8,000 people shared the post.
As the social media post gained traction from users eager to reunite the football with its owner, the appeal quickly reached Aoife's father Ruairí, who revealed the ball had gone missing a week beforehand.
Famous
"I'm Aoife's dad. She's 10 years old and she lost her ball on Woodstown Beach in Co Waterford last Sunday.
"I showed her the picture you posted - she thinks she's famous now. Thanks so much for posting it," he replied.
Speaking to Damien Tiernan on WLR FM, Ruairí said:"A friend of mine messaged asking if this was Aoife's ball and then a second friend messaged me.
"It shows you the power of social media when used for good. It only took five hours to find Aoife," he said.
Ruairí said the family are amazed at how the football travelled 200km across the Irish Sea.
Aoife is a bit bewildered. She's impressed by how interested people are in her ball.".
The Welsh woman updated the appeal after locating the owner, saying: "The post has reached Aoife's dad.
"Aoife lost her football near Waterford 7 days ago. Thanks to everyone who shared the post!".

The curtain will come down on Peaky Blinders after its upcoming sixth series, it has been confirmed.
However, creator and writer Steven Knight said the story would continue in "another form".
He announced the news in a statement confirming the hit crime drama, which is set in 1920s Birmingham, had resumed production after delays due to Covid-19.
It said: "Peaky is back and with a bang. After the production delay due to the Covid pandemic, we find the family in extreme jeopardy and the stakes have never been higher.
"We believe this will be the best series of all and are sure that our amazing fans will love it. While the TV series will be coming to an end, the story will continue in another form ."
The sixth series, written by Knight, will conclude the saga of Cillian Murphy's troubled Tommy Shelby and his family's rise to power.
Series five, which introduced Sam Claflin as the leader of the British Union of Fascists Oswald Mosley, ended with a cliffhanger and the Shelby family betrayed by their allies. It starred Helen McCrory as Polly Gray and Paul Anderson as Arthur Shelby, as well as Anya Taylor-Joy as Gina Gray.
The official Instagram account for the show shared a photo of Murphy on-set wearing a face mask.
Executive producer Caryn Mandabach said: "Along with our wonderful, supportive partners at BBC and Netflix, we have been working diligently to ensure we can get Peaky safely back into production; the safety of our cast and crew is always our priority.
Entranced
"Thank you to all the Peaky fans who have been so unwaveringly supportive and patient. Series six marks the end of an epic story that has entranced audiences since it first started in 2013, but the world of Peaky Blinders will most definitely live on."
Executive producer for the BBC, Tommy Bulfin, said: "We are very excited that filming for Peaky Blinders has begun and so grateful to everyone for all their hard work to make it happen. Steve's scripts for series six are truly remarkable."
Anthony Byrne returns as director having directed series five and Nick Goding will produce. Lucy Bedford is executive producer for production company Tiger Aspect.

Children suffer as parents turning to pandemic booze

Children are suffering due to their parents' problem drinking during lockdown as more turn to the bottle to cope with the stress of the Covid-19 pandemic, children's rights groups have warned.
As concerns grow about the impact of school closures on the well-being of children, problem drinking in the home has been flagged as a "worrying issue".
Tanya Ward, chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance, described it as the "dark side of lockdown".
"It can get very toxic at home as people have lost jobs because of Covid and are struggling with mental health and every day is a grind, so we are concerned," said Ms Ward.
"When you talk to schools who deal with parents who may be struggling with drinking, they highlight how Christmas is a difficult time due to increased consumption, then in January their children return to school and there's a focus on emotional well-being and trying to get them back into a routine, but for these children there's none of that now as schools are closed.
"It has definitely been an issue that has hugely come up. If people are drinking harmfully every day, that impacts their ability to parent their children, make sure their kids get fed, help them with homework, respond to their needs and it can sometimes result in them being violent towards their children."
Cases published yesterday by the Child Care Law Reporting Project (CCLRP) highlighted the growing impact of alcohol abuse on children.
In one case, the District Court made a care order for two children due to alcohol misuse and domestic violence. The court heard that the parents were in the middle of a divorce and there was alcohol misuse by both parties.
In another case, a child said she was fearful of living at home and was responsible for caring for her four younger siblings due to their parents' addiction issues. There was often no food or heating in the house and at one point the children did not attend school for several months.
Children's charity Barnardos - which works with vulnerable children and their families - said parents with a history of substance misuse are finding the lockdown incredibly hard.
"Parents who are in recovery are trying hard to stay on the straight and narrow and at the moment it is hard to manage that with the different stresses that Covid-19 brings," said Suzanne Connolly, chief executive of Barnardos.
"We are all trying to find coping mechanisms. This (pandemic) isn't easy for anyone but drink is a depressant and doesn't make things easier.
"It absolutely affects people's capacity to parent, and our real worry is for isolated families.
"We're very worried about vulnerable children for whom the usual structures are a vital source of safety. School is such an important source of routine and teachers notice if children aren't there or whether there is a change in their personality.
"In Barnardos, we work with schools to provide breakfast clubs and if parents have been drinking heavily, they're not going to be giving their children breakfast, which is why the clubs are so important."
Alcohol Action Ireland said problem alcohol use continues to be a source of trauma for many children during the ongoing pandemic.
Dr Sheila Gilheany, CEO of Alcohol Action, said the organisation met key stakeholders recently to establish timely and meaningful supports for children who are "largely voiceless in this situation".

Dear Joe? Farewell note tradition in peril as sulky Trump clears out his desk

President Donald Trump and president-elect Joe Biden are already breaking with tradition in failing to travel to the Capitol together for tomorrow's inauguration.
And after a tumultous and bitter election battle it also remains to be seen whether the outgoing president will leave the traditional friendly note of advice for his successor in the Oval Office.
Previous presidential transitions have often been characterised by courtesy and sometimes humour, commodities in short supply during the 2020 White House tussle.
The farewell note tradition as we know it is believed to have begun as President Ronald Reagan was preparing to leave the White House in January 1989 to mak way for his successor, George HW Bush.
He reached for a pad emblazoned with a cartoon under the phrase, Don't Let the Turkeys Get You Down on which featured a collection of turkeys scaling a prone elephant, the symbol of both men's Republican Party.
"Dear George, You'll have moments when you'll want to use this particular stationary. Well, go to it," Mr Reagan scrawled.
He said he would be praying for the new president before concluding: "I'll miss our Thursday lunches. Ron."
The missives' contents start off as confidential, but are often eventually made public by archivists, references in presidential memoirs or after journalists and others filed requests to obtain them.
But the 32-year tradition is in peril this year.
Mr Trump has refused to accept the results of November's election and vowed not to attend Mr Biden's inauguration with Mr Biden saying he agreed with that decision.
That makes it doubtful Mr Trump will leave behind any handwritten, friendly advice.
Presidents often write reflectively at the end of their time in office, including George Washington, who stated that he was "tired of public life" in recording why he was not seeking a third term.
But historians say Mr Reagan's is likely the first instance of a personal letter being passed between presidents.
Mark K Updegrove, a historian and chief executive of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation, who has written about the Bush family, said: "Though he had been soundly defeated by Bill Clinton, George HW Bush, as a good American, was wishing the new president well."
In his letter to Mr Clinton, Bush senior wrote: "I'm not a very good one to give advice; but just don't let the critics discourage you or push you off course," before concluding: "Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you. Good luck - George."
Writing to that president's son, incoming President George W Bush in 2000, Mr Clinton noted that the "burdens you now shoulder are great but often exaggerated" and that the "sheer joy of doing what you believe is right is inexpressible".
In his own letter to President Barack Obama eight years later, the younger Mr Bush advised that "critics will rage. Your 'friends' will disappoint you", but "no matter what comes, you will be inspired by the character and compassion of the people you now lead".
Advice
In his letter to Mr Trump in 2017, Mr Obama wrote: "This is a unique office, without a clear blueprint for success, so I don't know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful."
But he did offer some words that now appear prophetic given Mr Trump's impeachment for inciting the deadly violence at the US Capitol.
"We are just temporary occupants of this office," he wrote.
"That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions - like rule of law, separation of powers, that our forebears fought and bled for."
"It's up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them."

Hero principal Dave has drive to help his pupils

The head of a high support school has been driving around to his pupils' homes in a 'remote learning van' to support their needs.
Dave Carter,  principal at St Paul's Youth Encounter Project in Finglas,  Co Dublin, believes all schools should be able to open for vulnerable children from very disadvantaged backgrounds and that teachers at special schools should be prioritised for early vaccination.
"A lot of marginalised families may not have the hardware, software or knowhow to manage remote learning and we are bringing devices already set up with wifi and connected, to the teacher, who will deliver a 30-minutes class," Mr Carter said.
"Myself and our family therapist wait outside the home until the class is finished and then go to the next pupil. These homes have no broadband and students are getting one-hour tuition at most a week."
St Paul's caters for students aged 10 to 16 years old and is under the classification of a special school.
These schools are set to reopen later this week with a staggered programme to reduce numbers in the school at any one time. However, Mr Carter believes other schools should also be open for vulnerable children.
"For vulnerable children, I feel all schools should be given the trust and autonomy to open, provided it is safe to do so for students and staff, according to their resources," he said.
"For many, school is more than education of a set curriculum but one of learning to cope with life and it can be a safe refuge from difficulties elsewhere."
Mr Carter pointed out that the school closures during lockdown last year had been the catalyst for some children having to go into residential care.
While he said it was essential that his pupils were in school and welcomed the upcoming reopening, he added that social distancing is very difficult to implement in special schools.
With this taken into consideration, along with the new, more transmissible variant of Covid, these teachers face more risk.
"The pupils at my school often have behavioural difficulties and social distancing and mask wearing is not possible.
Solution
"This is similar for schools catering for those with special educational needs, so the Government needs to be cognisant teachers in special schools are more at risk and early vaccination would be a solution.
"My own family members have underlying health issues and are worried about me visiting my pupils' homes, but I have no choice as we need to check up on these kids. Otherwise they will get no support."
St Paul's is among the 124 special schools that are set to reopen to their students on Thursday.

Nphet concerned at scale of testing in units with staff clusters

The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) raised serious concerns with the HSE over the lack of mass testing in hospitals when Covid-19 outbreaks were identified among staff.
The issue was raised directly with the HSE at a meeting of the expert public health group before Christmas.
Chief medical officer Tony Holohan also personally "voiced his concerns" over the speed at which outbreaks were being detected in hospitals.
Minutes of a Nphet meeting on December 10 show the group "expressed concern and sought clarity" as to why mass testing was not being carried out in all hospitals where outbreaks had been detected.
Nphet noted the "criteria for mass testing had previously been identified and agreed".
The HSE responded saying it seeks advice from "local public health departments" when there is an outbreak in a hospital and then decides whether or not to "engage in mass testing".
It said outbreak management is carried out between local hospital management with "involvement by the central executive where necessary".
On that date in December, there were 52 open clusters associated with 21 acute hospitals. About 1,000 cases were linked to these outbreaks, with 48pc related to healthcare workers. There had been 63 deaths linked to these outbreaks.
Deaths
In the first week of January, there were 158 outbreaks in hospitals. This brought the total to 1,819 confirmed Covid-19 cases in hospitals, of those 37 were admitted to ICU and 147 died.
Nphet suggested the HSE establish a national outbreak control team to "ensure consistency of approach nationally to addressing hospital outbreaks and engaging in mass testing".
At a meeting a week earlier, Mr Holohan is reported to have "voiced his concern about the speed of outbreak detection and response in acute settings".
"The chair also posed the question whether a national outbreak control team has been established and if not, the reasons why?" the minutes of the meeting read.
The HSE responded saying one of the "core challenges" facing hospitals was how best to isolate the virus quickly when detected.
"The HSE pointed to some areas in need of improvement in hospital infrastructure and isolation capacity.
"While some facilities are well-equipped to deal with isolation requirements along with occupational health needs, there are other hospitals that are not. These deficiencies have been exacerbated by the pandemic," the minutes read.
Students
Separately, the HSE "voiced its concern" that many student nurses, who were on placement in acute hospitals, were working in nursing homes at weekends.
They said this movement of student nurses may be "exacerbating transmission in these environments". It suggested that guidance should be developed to address the issue.
The Department of Health said it was difficult to ask student nurses not to work at the weekends as "it is often their only source of income".
Yesterday, Mr Holohan said mass testing in hospitals is not possible at the moment because the level of community transmission is out of control. But said he hoped it could play a role in the future in hospitals.

Schools may stay closed as teachers slam government

Government plans to reopen schools for pupils with special needs on Thursday are in chaos amidst a backlash from teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs).
In a serious setback, the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) last night called for the move to be reconsidered. Now it will be a race against the clock to overcome what the INTO has described as "grave safety concerns".
The INTO's statement will be a devastating blow to families of thousands of children with special needs, who have suffered most by being out of school during the pandemic.
But an emergency meeting of the union's executive committee said their concerns had not been adequately addressed by a special public health webinar yesterday and by Government.
The INTO executive meets again today to assess the situation, as will the leadership of the Fórsa union, which represents 12,000 special needs assistants and which is also seeking more assurances on health and safety measures.
The INTO said it would "continue to engage with the Department of Education and public health authorities in an effort to work towards a safe, phased re-opening".
However, up-to-date, reliable information and supports are essential if this effort is to succeed.
If the partial re-opening is abandoned, it will be the second time in a fortnight that Education Minister Norma Foley has been forced to retreat on this issue.
Staggered
After a false start the previous week, talks with the unions got under way and, last Thursday, Ms Foley and Junior Minister for Special Education, Josepha Madigan, announced a "shared ambition" for a staggered re-opening.
This would start with the phased return of pupils with special needs from this coming Thursday.
Detailed arrangements were sent to schools last Friday, following agreement with the unions, but it later emerged that there were issues to be resolved.
Friday's release sparked fury among the ranks of special education staff at being asked to go back to work while the community at large is told to stay at home because of high Covid infection rates.
Advocacy organisations representing families with children with special needs were subjected to some of the anger.
A webinar yesterday was aimed at reassuring special education teachers and SNAs that it was safe for them to return to schools, but it met much hostile reaction.
Around 16,000 participants logged on for the hour-long session presented by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn, HSE Assistant National Director Dr Kevin Kelleher and public health consultant Dr Abigail Collins.
But their efforts to allay fears were greeted with comments such as "waste of time", "insult to all", "patronising" and "old data". The latter remark related to the use of Covid figures from schools last term.
INTO General Secretary John Boyle said the webinar did not address teachers' concerns. He laid the blame for the current debacle at the feet of the Government.
Messages
Mr Boyle said they "must take responsibility for poor and untimely communication and mixed messages over the past two weeks".
He continued: "The failure of Minister Foley and Minister Madigan to engage in proper consultation in the last two weeks has been very damaging and it has hampered the planning for the safe re-opening of schools.
"Issues of concern include childcare facilities, special education staff in high-risk categories, those aged over 60 and pregnant staff, and an update on the prioritisation of special education staff for access to the Covid-19 vaccine."

Signs virus surge is slowing but death toll remains high

The death toll from Covid-19 this month is almost twice the figure for the entire month of December - but there are now signs the virus surge may be gradually slowing down.
There have been 338 deaths from the virus this month, with eight people dying yesterday - the youngest of whom was 49 and the oldest was 93.
However, for the second day in a row the daily number of cases fell, from 2,944 on Sunday to 2,121. The numbers in hospital, which had been at 2,032, fell to 1,975 by the afternoon yesterday.
Hospitals are under intense pressure, with 200 seriously ill patients in intensive care relying heavily on adapted surge beds to look after the sickest with the virus.
Chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, said we need to restrict our movements down to the minimum so "we can drive this infection down faster than we have been driving it down so far".
Asked about the reopening of schools for special needs pupils, deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said there are no "zero-risk" environments. However, he said the closure of schools should be a "last resort".
"There are people working in shops all across the country and that's not a zero-risk environment," he added.
Dr Vida Hamilton, HSE clinical adviser, said there are 312 patients in critical care, adding that the situation is "very pressurised but functioning".
Asked about the risk of more infectious forms of the virus being brought into the country by overseas travellers arriving here, Dr Holohan said there is little point trying to stop the UK variant becoming the dominant strain.
He said measures cannot keep these viruses out of the country, but they can slow their progress and allow the opportunity to get as many people as possible vaccinated.
There is no evidence of onward transmission of the South African variant and the Brazilian variant has not been identified here.
Meanwhile, Dr Lorraine Nolan of the Health Products Regulatory Authority said it has received 81 reports of suspected reactions to the Covid-19 vaccine so far. However, all reactions are within the expected range and transient.
She said, internationally, there have been reports of anaphylaxis associated with the vaccine, but it is very rare.
The incidence of this with the vaccine is around one in 100,000 and, as more people get the vaccine, it is expected there will be suspected cases reported here also.
Referring to the 23 deaths of very elderly people with severe illness in Norway after getting the vaccine, Dr Nolan said there is no evidence to show they were caused by the vaccine.

'Wall of Sound' producer Phil Spector dies of Covid, aged 81

Rock producer Phil Spector, who changed the sound of pop in the 1960s with his "Wall of Sound" recordings and was later convicted of murder, has died at the age of 81 from Covid-19.
He was diagnosed with the virus a month ago and taken to hospital from his prison cell, where he had been serving a 19 years to life term for the murder of actress Lana Clarkson in 2003.
Spector produced 20 top-40 hits between 1961 and 1965 and later worked with the Beatles on Let It Be, as well as with Leonard Cohen, the Righteous Brothers and Ike and Tina Turner.
Trial
Clarkson (40) was killed by a shot to the mouth from Spector's gun in the foyer of his mock castle home outside Los Angeles on February 3, 2003.
The two had met hours earlier at a Hollywood nightclub.
Spector was convicted of second-degree murder in a second trial after the first one deadlocked in 2007. The case drew worldwide interest because of Spector's fame.
He began his career as a performer, recording a hit single as a teenager with his band the Teddy Bears, but found his true calling as the producing genius behind 1960s girl groups such as the Crystals and the Ronettes.
His signature production technique, the "Wall of Sound", layered pop and even classical instruments into a full, lush sound that was new to pop records.
He called it "a Wagnerian approach to rock & roll: little symphonies for the kids".
By the late 1970s, Spector, who once said he had "devils that fight inside me", had become something of a recluse, retreating behind the walls of his hilltop mansion near Los Angeles where Clarkson was killed years later.
Prosecutors charged Spector with murder despite his assertions that Clarkson, the star of such films as Barbarian Queen and Amazon Women on the Moon, had shot herself for reasons he could not grasp.
He told Esquire maga-zine in an interview that Clarkson had "kissed the gun" in a bizarre suicide.
Spector had a troubled early life. His father took his own life, his sister spent time in mental institutions and Spector himself suffered bouts of severe depression.
He also had a long-standing reputation for gunplay.
The producer carried a pistol, and a biographer said he often placed it on the recording console as he worked.
It was also reported that he had fired a shot in the studio during an acrimonious recording session with John Lennon.
Born Harvey Phillip Spector on December 26, 1939, he grew up in New York City and formed the Teddy Bears with three high school friends.
They scored a hit single in 1958 with a song titled after the inscription on his father's headstone: To Know Him Is to Love Him.
The Teddy Bears had little other chart success and disbanded the following year.
In the early 1960s, Spector teamed up with songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, co-writing the Ben E King hit Spanish Harlem.
In 1961, he and promoter Lester Sill formed Philles Records, releasing singles with what was becoming his trademark sound.
Spector signed Ike and Tina Turner in 1966 and released what he considered one of his masterpieces, the powerful River Deep, Mountain High, but it reached only number 88 in the US charts.
For a time, he turned his back on the record business, marrying Ronettes singer Veronica 'Ronnie' Bennett, who would later say he was abusive and possessive.
He returned in 1969, signing a production deal with A&M Records and working with Lennon on his hit single Instant Karma and with the Beatles on the Let It Be album.
Let it Be was considered a major comeback for Spector, but Paul McCartney was so unhappy with it that in 2003 he oversaw the release of Let It Be ... Naked, which removed most of Spector's work.
Spector returned to the studio in the mid-1970s to work on records by Cher and others, but by the end of the decade he had become increasingly reclusive and worked rarely after that.

All ages now in ICU as Donnelly warns the peak is still to come

The situation in hospitals is stark with people of all ages being admitted to intensive care units (ICU) due to Covid-19, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has warned.
And Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has said the number being hospitalised and admitted to ICU is expected to peak within the next week or two.
The latest figures show there are 1,928 patients in hospital with the virus.
Deaths
There were 2,944 new cases of Covid-19 reported yesterday as well as 13 deaths, all of which occurred this month.
It came after 60 deaths were reported on Saturday as well as 3,231 new cases.
Of the cases notified yesterday: 1,065 cases were in Dublin, 306 were in Cork, 181 were in Galway, 180 were in Kildare, 160 were in Limerick and the remaining were spread across all other counties.
Dr Holohan said: "We are seeing people of all ages being admitted to hospital and being taken into intensive care units.
"The levels of infection are such that your chances of transmitting or getting Covid-19 are very high, and we know that a proportion of those cases will lead to serious illness and mortality.
"There is no group who should feel the public health advice does not apply to them."
He also urged employers to facilitate their employees working from home.
"As we look forward to the week ahead, consider your choices and make the right ones. Do not go into work tomorrow if you can work from home. If you are an employer, facilitate remote working for your employees."
Meanwhile, Mr Donnelly warned on RTÉ's This Week that the numbers in ICU will continue to rise and "the situation will get worse before it gets better".
However, he said the number of patients being hospitalised with Covid-19 is expected to peak within the next week or two, in what has been the third wave of the pandemic here.
He said that new modelling in the past few days from Professor Philip Nolan, who heads a team tracking Covid-19, suggests that this week, or potentially next week, "the hospitalisations and the number of patients in ICU should peak". Mr Donnelly said there are currently 195 patients in critical care.
Surge
"The number in ICU is going to continue to rise. We know it's going to get worse before it gets better. We have surge capacity of 350 critical care beds."
He said there are 40 to 50 critical care beds available under the deal in place with private hospitals.
"The focus right now is on making sure we have the beds, most importantly we have the staff. There has been a lot of work done since the first wave.
"PPE is fine. The number of ventilators if you remember back in March was a very serious concern, oxygen is fine."

Anger as private staff get jab ahead of public workers

Staff at a private diagnostic clinic were vaccinated before public healthcare workers, it has emerged.
Vaccinations were given to staff working in Affidea clinic in Dublin last week while nurses in Nenagh Hospital in Tipperary were force to publicly plead with Health Minister Stephen Donnelly for vaccines.
Affidea, which charges patients up to €100 for X-rays and €260 for MRIs, did not respond to a request for comment on why their staff were vaccinated before public healthcare workers.
Scandalous
Labour Party leader Alan Kelly has said it is "scandalous" that private hospital staff have been vaccinated ahead of public healthcare workers.
Yesterday, Mr Donnelly finally broke his silence on the controversy saying his vaccination plan does not distinguish between private and public healthcare workers.
"The schedule is that frontline healthcare workers who are patient-facing are being prioritised," he said on Newstalk.
It emerged last week that staff in the exclusive Hermitage Medical Centre and Beacon Hospital had been vaccinated while other public healthcare workers were still waiting for jabs.
Some staff in the private Bon Secours hospital group were also vaccinated last week.
Yesterday, Dr Stephen Frohlich, head of intensive care at the Beacon Hospital, said almost 300 of their staff have been vaccinated.
"The Beacon is an acute hospital. We see 60 to 70 patients a day in the emergency department," he said.
"We are dealing with at least 100 surgeries a day on both public and private patients.
"It is only right for those patients who are coming in for surgery that the staff have been vaccinated.
Last week, in a video posted online, clinical nurse manager at Nenagh Hospital Louise Morgan Walsh asked why staff at the public hospital were being "left out" while staff at private hospitals got vaccinated.
"We are so angry, we are scared, we are afraid, we can see our co-workers going down with Covid and becoming very ill," she said.

Denise Van Outen man- aged to make her debut performance on Dancing On Ice despite a "clumsy" fall that nearly dashed her dreams of taking part in the competition.
Van Outen (46) was rushed to hospital last week after partially dislocating her shoulder when she fell face first during rehearsals.
"Thank you for all your lovely messages this morning. Told you I'm clumsy on the ice!" she wrote on Instagram.
She also thanked the "glorious" NHS for "looking after me because I know how overstretched you are at the moment".
"Also thank you to Matt Evers for being a true friend and taking care of me and making me laugh when I feel like crying," she said.
Tumbles
The West End singer previously discussed her injury, saying she has "taken a few tumbles since we started training, but with this one I knew immediately it wasn't good".
"Straight away I knew I'd done something. I just thought, 'Please don't let it be a break'," she said.
"The on-site medics and physio checked me over immediately and my shoulder was quickly iced."
Last night's launch featured performances by van Outen alongside five of the other 12 contestants.
Actors Jason Donovan and Joe-Warren Plant, comedian Rufus Hound, media personality Rebekah Vardy and rapper Lady Leshurr all took to the ice.
Despite her shoulder injury, Van Outen and Evers performed an upbeat routine to Tina Turner's Proud Mary.
After the pair received a total score of 19.5, show judge Christopher Dean said: "Once this arm is better and you get more confidence I know you'll come out fighting."
According to Ladbrokes, actress Faye Brookes, who is scheduled to perform next week, is the favourite to win the competition.
Dancing On Ice is on Virgin Media One on Sundays

Gardaí seize more than €1m in cash in crime gang crackdown

Gardai have seized more than €1m in cash during searches of two premises in Dublin yesterday.
The money was discovered by officers from the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), assisted by the Garda Dog Unit, in an operation targeting suspected criminal activities of an organised crime group.
A garda spokesman said the two premises - in North Dublin and Dublin city centre - were searched in the course of the operation and a number of vehicles were seized.
"In the course of a search of one vehicle, a concealment of cash was discovered. The vehicle and its content remain subject of examination," the spokesman said.
"However, the amount seized is believed to exceed €1m. Investigations are continuing."
Assistant Commissioner John O'Driscoll, head of Organised and Serious Crime (OSC), said: "We continue to target those causing most harm in our community.
"This seizure of a significant quantity of cash will, we believe, contribute to the disruption and potential ultimate dismantling of particular organised crime groups that we continue to target, building on earlier success achieved, in recent years".
An operation was also carried out in the Coolock area yesterday as part of an ongoing investigation targeting a Dublin-based drugs gang.
Recovered
Gardaí attached to the GNDOCB searched a house and car in the area on Saturday which led to €117,000 in cash and a Rolex being recovered.
A 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of money-laundering offences and is currently being held at Coolock garda station.
It is understood the man is a licensed taxi driver who may have been used to hold the cash for an organised crime group. "This individual is suspected of being used as a 'gilly' to hold the cash and at this stage there is nothing to suggest that he was involved at any higher level," one source said.
Mr O'Driscoll said the seizure is the latest success against the crime gangs.
"We continue to target those causing most harm in our community," he said.
"This seizure of a significant quantity of cash will, we believe, contribute to the disruption and potential ultimate dismantling of particular organised crime groups that we continue to target, building on earlier success achieved, in recent years."

Glenn Hoddle has admitted it was "incredibly tough" to keep his appearance in The Masked Singer a secret from his family.
The former England footballer and manager had his identity revealed during the ITV show on Saturday evening after being disguised as Grandfather Clock.
When asked about his first performance, he said: "I was so nervous and the heat in that costume was incredible.
"I had thought I was going to be OK as I have performed to a live audience before, but this was a totally different experience and well out my comfort zone."
Tongue
He also said it was "incredibly tough" to keep his appearance in the programme a secret.
"I wanted to share the news with my children and grandchildren as I knew they'd love it," he said.
"I've had to bite my tongue on quite a few occasions."
Hoddle (63) said he was "fully involved" with the process of designing his disguise and "I had a couple of options, but just felt this was perfect, especially when I saw the costume close up".
He added: "It was a little restrictive, so I wasn't able to move as freely as I would have liked for a song or two but it was an amazing experience."
Hoddle also said he was "gutted" to leave the competition at the stage he did.
"I had some great songs lined up if I was able to continue," he said.
"But overall, I really loved the experience and was just happy to have taken part."

A young man ripped a garda's stab vest as he violently resisted arrest after shouting at a passing patrol car on a city street.
Karl Fitzsimons (28) was being arrested for roaring threats at the officers when he caused the damage, a court heard.
Judge Bryan Smyth adjourned the case for compensation and a probation report.
Fitzsimons, of Sean O'Casey Avenue, Dublin 1, pleaded guilty to garda obstruction, criminal damage and threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour.
Dublin District Court heard the accused was on North Great George's Street at 10pm on October 27 last year when he began shouting in the direction of a patrol car.
Chase
When the gardaí stopped, he threatened them, became abusive and violently resisted arrest, ripping one officer's stab vest. The damage cost around €50.
In a foot chase, he threw broken glass from inside his jacket in the direction of the gardaí.
The accused had mental health issues and worked in construction but was currently unemployed, his solicitor Roy O'Neill said.
He was "embarrassed and ashamed of his actions" and apologised to the gardaí, Mr O'Neill said, asking the judge to leave Fitzsimons without convictions.
Judge Smyth said it was a "serious incident" and the accused would have to pay compensation for the damage and co-operate with the probation service.

A young mother fought off three hooded teenagers who laughed as they lunged at her with a knife and sliced her leg during an attack.
Emma Hanrahan (30) managed to deflect the blade from her face and neck then kicked and punched at the youths until they fled.
Ms Hanrahan, who carries out voluntary work in the community, was walking through the GAA car park in Balbriggan when she was hit from behind at about 6.30pm on Friday.
"I had my earphones in so I didn't hear them coming until I got a thump to the back of my head and was pushed  face down to the ground," she said.
"I saw feet and then felt pain in my leg where they cut me.
"I just started punching and kicking as hard as I could and I managed to knock one to the ground.
"I saw the weapon, which I reckon was a knife, coming at my face and neck but, thankfully, I managed to get my hands up in time and the thickness of my jacket sleeve took the cuts.
"They were just laughing all the time, and when I kicked one of them to the ground, the other said 'Run blood', or some kind of gang slang to them.
"They were only kids, maybe 17 or 18-years-old or even younger, and were covered up well.
"I don't think they wanted to rob me because I had my phone, €20 and cigarettes in my pockets but they didn't even look for anything.
"When they ran off, I just got up and ran and stumbled to try and get to safety and an elderly man came to see if I was OK.
"He had heard screams and had rung the gardaí who arrived within about five minutes.
"The gardaí brought me home and the paramedics called to check me over later.
"My lip is busted and there was a lot of blood.
"The back of my ear was cut, I've bruises everywhere as I got kicked to the side of my head and face and I've a cut to my leg from the blade.
Tough
Ms Hanrahan said her 10-year-old daughter was supposed to be with her, but had changed her mind before she left the house.
"I won't be going out for a walk on my own ever again," Ms Hanrahan said.
"I grew up in a rough area of Dublin and I'm a tough cookie, but this has really shaken me to the core.
"When you're in that situation, it's true what they say, your life really does flash before your eyes, and all I could see were my daughters and my partner Rob.
"I work really hard with community groups to try and make this town safer, and I'm just thinking, is this the thanks I get - to get jumped on?
"The situation in this town is getting out of hand and I don't want my daughters growing up here in the way it is at the minute.
"I just can't get it out of my head that they were laughing all the time they were lunging at me with a knife.
"They're just vile-mouthed animals."
Gardaí said they are investigating an alleged assault on the Bath Road, Balbriggan, on Friday.
No arrests have been made but investigations are continuing.

New one-stop shop will help upskilling

A new one-stop-shop for upskilling and apprenticeship courses is being launched as part of a government effort to encourage people who lost their jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic to retrain.
The first-of-its-kind online resource will combine all apprenticeship and third-level education options available and help people find the course that best suits.
The move follows invest- ment in new third-level education and apprenticeship courses.
Speaking ahead of the launch of The Right Course initiative, Higher Education Minister Simon Harris said there is a huge range of upskilling options available, but added that the current system is "complex and can over-burden some people".
Mr Harris said the new online portal, to be launched today, will provide a clear picture of what is on offer and how courses can be accessed.
"If you are unemployed temporarily as a result of Covid-19, now could be the time to do a short course," Mr Harris said.
"You can still retain your welfare payments while undertaking the course. If you are in employment but want to improve your skillset, there are options available."
Mr Harris said the pandem- ic has forced the Government to confront the skills short- age facing the country and said upskilling certain areas of the work- force is "critical to securing our recovery".
Talent
"Ireland is a small country. We cannot afford to have untapped talent and we cannot leave any person locked out of society because of a lack of skills," he said.
"This new portal will be a valuable tool to help each person identify the most suitable upskilling option for themselves and their teams. It is never too late to learn something new."
Mr Harris said 1,358 employers so far have availed of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme which gives them a €3,000 grant for each apprentice they hire.

Remote working 'driving interest in larger homes' as prices forecast to increase 6pc

Property prices are predicted to rise by as much as 6pc this year as an increase in people working from home is driving higher interest in houses across Ireland.
The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) releases its annual review for 2021 today, and two out of three agents forecast an increase in property prices throughout the country in the next 12 months.
Dublin, which already has the highest prices, is predicted to see increases of 3pc.
Connacht and Ulster - which have the lowest prices - are set to see a rise of 6pc.
Leinster is similarly set to see prices go up, by 4pc, while in Munster they are forecast to rise by 5pc.
The society's vice president, TJ Cronin said: "Sixty-two per cent of the chartered agents and auctioneers who are predicting prices will rise, say it is because of the lack of supply of new and second-hand homes, while 33pc say economic performance and the impact of Covid-19 on output will be the key drivers."
He went on to say that Covid-19 will continue to dictate activity levels in 2021 as it did last year, and discussed the impact that working from home has had on the market.
"We can see that the transition to working from home has led to a re-ordering of priorities and is driving interest in larger properties in regional locations with good broadband and lots of amenities, as well as holiday homes in secondary locations," he said.
"The trend away from urban areas is also reflected in the survey's price projections, with agents in Dublin forecasting the lowest growth and agents in Connacht/Ulster the highest."
Covid-19 has also affected the rental sector, with figures from the Residential Tenancies Board showing that last year had the lowest national annual growth rate for rent since late 2012.
However, many agents believe this has to do with a temporary increase in supply thanks to the pandemic, as several thousand short-terms lets which were previously aimed at tourists suddenly had to come on the market.
Dominant
One of the report's main findings is that supply remains a dominant issue, with it possibly taking over a decade to be met.
By 2031, it is predicted the sector will need to be building in excess of 60,000 units per year, which is over three times current output.
Mr Cronin said this lack of supply may drive sales. He noted that the pandemic has affected some buyers more than others.
"People who have been worst affected from an economic perspective are very often excluded from the property market on affordability grounds. That is an indictment of the failed housing policies of the past," he said.

Campaigners want graves of all mother and baby home victims to be found and memorialised

Mother and baby home campaigners have demanded a commitment to find and properly mark the graves of hundreds of infants who died in the notorious facilities over a span of more than 60 years.
The call came as President Michael D Higgins insisted that meeting the needs and concerns of survivors must now be at the heart of the State's response to the traumatic legacy of mother and baby homes.
"As President of Ireland, I welcome the publication of the commission's report and the apologies offered," he said.
"My thoughts must be, as they have been so often before, of the mothers and of the infants who died; of those children who survived and who continue to carry the trauma of their early lives, and beyond that the burden of being deprived of information about their birth parents.
"Of all of those women, alive and dead, who have borne the scars of their experiences, the shame and secrecy imposed upon them, and the life-long burden for so many arising from trauma, bereavement or separation from their children.
"The report took five years to complete and there is now a responsibility to move, without delay, to the next phase of this process and to respond adequately and generously to the needs and rightful concerns of the survivors and other victims."
Campaigners have insisted that the State must support its words of apology with firm action to right the wrongs involved, including finding all unmarked baby graves.
Mothers want urgent action on the excavation of the Tuam site in Co Galway, as well as a commitment to examine the site of the Bessborough estate in Cork, where it is feared hundreds of infant graves still remain unidentified.
Bessborough in Blackrock, Co Cork - at one time Ireland's largest mother and baby home - was infamous for a high infant mortality rate.
Of the more than 900 babies who died at Bessborough or in Cork hospitals having been transferred from the mother and baby home over seven decades, fewer than 70 have known individual burial sites.
Campaigners want all proposed development at the Bessborough estate paused until a full investigation of possible burial sites is conducted and a proper memorial erected.
Mothers have insisted that, if necessary, ground- mapping radar should be used to identify possible mass burial sites.
A recently discovered historic estate map indicated a previously unknown burial area.
Catherine Coffey O'Brien, whose mother Christina died last week, said a proper investigation of the site is now warranted.
Exhumations
"We want an independent body to come in and carefully assess the site," she said.
"We then want the ground handed over to Cork City Council, to protect the site and to preserve it as a graveyard."
Ms Coffey O'Brien said survivors do not want exhumations.
Campaigner Ann O'Gorman said Ireland had a duty to those who suffered at Bessborough and other homes to locate and properly mark any burial plots.
Ms O'Gorman had a baby girl, Evelyn, at Bessborough but was told that she had died.
"I want to see this investigated properly. We need closure - it would make me so happy to see that investigation done," said Ms O'Gorman.
"I am in an awful state over what happened here. The whole lot of me has gone into finding my daughter."

Careless driving soldier said gun was pulled on him

A soldier in the British army said he was surrounded by gardaí and had a gun pulled on him after a careless driving incident escalated in Dublin city centre.
Brandon Hatton (21) took off at speed and swerved in traffic when he was followed by gardaí who saw him make an illegal right turn, a court heard.
His defence maintained the garda response was due to him being wrongly identified as a "dangerous" person.
Hatton, of Downpatrick Road, Crumlin, pleaded guilty to careless driving last June 3.
Judge Bryan Smyth fined him €250.
Dublin District Court heard gardaí saw a VW Golf being driven in a suspicious manner and followed it to O'Connell Bridge, where it made an "unlawful manoeuvre" by turning right on to Aston Quay, running a red pedestrian light, a garda sergeant said.
The Golf stopped, and when gardaí approached it took off again "at speed", making dangerous swerving manoeuvres.
Worse
It was finally halted by gardaí with the help of the national crime unit.
The defence said the incident "sounds worse than it is".
According to the accused, the patrol car's flashing blue light was not turned on, and when he was stopped a van pulled in front of him, he was surrounded by unmarked garda cars and a gun was pulled on him.
Gardaí had misidentified Hatton as another person.
"We are dealing with an illegal turn, then it escalated because of misidentification," the defence said.
It was disputed whether the garda car's lights and sirens were activated.
Hatton maintained he would have stopped if he had known they were gardaí.
The accused was a soldier in the British army and had just returned from a tour overseas.
A conviction would have a serious impact on his career, his defence said.
Judge Smyth said he had to apply a conviction as it was a penalty point offence.

Dangerous driver is jailed and banned for life after smashing into elderly couple

A disqualified driver who drove down the wrong side of the M50 to escape gardaí before ploughing into the car of an elderly couple has been jailed for seven and a half years.
Brian Reilly (24) ruined the lives of John and Ellen Armstrong after he crashed into their car when they were stopped at a red light in Finglas last January, Judge Melanie Greally told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court yesterday.
Ellen Armstrong suffered significant injuries and had to have the tip of her thumb amputated, which has left her dependent on others, the court heard.
Reilly, a disqualified driver with 126 previous convictions, was trying to escape gardaí after he was stopped and asked for his driving licence.
He had been released from jail six weeks before the incident after serving a sentence for offences including endangerment, the court heard.
Reilly, of Tailteann Drive, Navan, Co Meath, pleaded guilty to two counts of endangerment, one count of dangerous driving causing serious bodily harm, one count of refusing to provide a blood or urine sample and one count of driving without insurance on January 29, 2020.
Judge Greally said Reilly "exposed four separate drivers to risk of death or serious harm" on the day in question.
"In the case of Ms Armstrong, he inflicted a life-long episode of pain and loss of independence and loss of the pursuits she enjoyed so much," she said.
She imposed a sentence of seven and a half years and suspended the final 18 months on a number of conditions, including that Reilly engage with drug addiction services.
She disqualified him from driving for life.
Garda Kieran Moloney previously told the court that a garda approached Reilly's car at a garage on the North Road in Finglas.
When asked for his licence, Reilly took off at speed, going the wrong way around a roundabout before driving the wrong way down the M50 and the N2.
The incident came to an end when Reilly crashed into a van at Kilshane Cross.
This collision sent his car crashing into the Armstrongs. Their car then crashed into a tree.
Suffered
Reilly refused to provide a blood or urine sample to find out if he was under the influence of an intoxicant, the court heard.
Ms Armstrong suffered multiple rib fractures and other injuries in the crash, the court heard.
Her husband John Armstrong still suffers pain on a daily basis.
He suffered a head wound and had a seizure in the wake of the crash.
The defence said his client had "panicked" when he was pulled over by gardaí.
The court heard Reilly has spent much of his life in and out of prison.
Almost half of Reilly's convictions are for road traffic offences, including six for dangerous driving, nine for driving without a licence and eight for driving without insurance.
"He has directly caused adversity and harm to two individuals who were expecting a comfortable retirement," the defence said, adding Reilly was extremely remorseful.

Fury as private hospitals get vaccine while public staff left to plead for help

There is growing anger over the vaccination of staff in private hospitals and clinics ahead of frontline public healthcare workers.
Private healthcare nurses and doctors have been vaccinated in the last week under the HSE's National Vaccination Programme.
Meanwhile, public healthcare workers have been forced to beg the Government for vaccines as Covid ravages hospital wards.
Refusing
Public hospitals have been treating the vast majority of the record number of new coronavirus cases.
Under a recent Government deal, private hospitals said they would allow just 30pc of their wards to be used to treat non-Covid patients.
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly is refusing to address the controversy despite the public healthcare service facing its biggest crisis since the start of the pandemic.
Yesterday, Labour Party leader Alan Kelly said it is "scandalous and completely wrong" that private healthcare staff are being vaccinated ahead of public nurses and doctors who are dealing with rocketing numbers of Covid cases every day.
And in an extraordinary development nurses in Nenagh Hospital in Tipperary published a video online in which they pleaded with the Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister Donnelly to tell them why they had not yet been vaccinated.
In the video, Nenagh clinical nurse manager Louise Morgan Walsh said: "We are so angry, we are scared, we are afraid, we can see our co-workers going down with Covid and becoming very ill."
It comes as it emerged nurses and doctors in the exclusive Hermitage Medical Clinic in Dublin have been vaccinated.
The Hermitage said 200 staff were vaccinated in line with the HSE's plan to prioritise those who are working in acute settings caring for patients.
It has been reported staff in the Bon Secours private hospital group have also been vaccinated.
Staff working in the Beacon Hospital in Dublin were also given vaccines as the hospital is being used as vaccination centre for healthcare workers.
Surge
The Beacon said it is not charging the HSE for use of its "state-of-the-art" vaccination centre and said staff volunteered to administer the vaccine.
However, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said he is concerned that the Denis O'Brien-owned Beacon was chosen as a vaccine centre after the hospital refused to sign a deal which would see some of their bed capacity taken over by the State to deal with the record surge in Covid cases.
Mr Reid is understood to be furious that he was blind-sided by news that the Beacon was to be used after the HSE announced it.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar suggested the deal could be reviewed if there was a review clause in the contract.
However, there is no review clause.
Mr Varadkar said designating the Beacon as a vaccination centre is "at odds" with the hospital's refusal to sign a deal that would give the HSE extra capacity.
Fine Gael Seanad leader Regina Doherty said it is "disrespectful" that Mr Donnelly is refusing to publicly address the issue and said the Beacon deal should be reversed.
A HSE spokesperson said: "The programme of vaccinating frontline healthcare workers against Covid-19 makes no distinction between them, whether they work in the community or in hospitals or in private or public healthcare."

Gardaí welcome new law to deter criminals who groom children into life of crime

Senior gardaí have welcomed the introduction of a new law that will see sentences of up to five years imposed on criminals who groom children to do their dirty work for them.
"This has been a problem for many, many years and it is as severe an issue now as it ever has been, so the new law is definitely a step in the right direction," a source said.
Justice Minister Helen McEntee said the new legislation was designed to break the link between organised crime and vulnerable young people and to stop criminal gangs leading children into a life of crime.
Gardaí need special permission from the DPP to charge a child aged 14 or under.
However, most cases involving a teenager under 16 are dealt with by youth diversion programmes rather than the courts.
This makes vulnerable children from mostly disadvantaged areas prime targets for gang bosses who use the children for multiple crimes including moving illegal drugs, arson attacks, intimidation and acting as lookouts.
Gardaí have obtained evidence that burglary gangs have been using children as young as seven to break in to houses for them.
One gang was suspected of using around 16 children under the age of 12 to carry out burglaries across the country as well as recruiting dozens of older juveniles.
Gardaí and other agencies are investigating the activities of a midlands-based woman who is suspected of grooming dozens of children to carry out shoplifting and robbery offences across the country.
Grooming was commonly used by Limerick's criminal outfits during the city's out-of-control gang feud that only ended when all its main protagonists were locked up or murdered.
It is a huge problem in the capital, and a 2019 investigation into crime networks in south central Dublin provided an insight into how young children are lured into gangs.
Cartel
The report, Building Community Resilience, identified around 650 people involved in the crime network in the area, with some as young as 12.
Gardaí in the capital's south inner city have established that more than half-a-dozen boys aged between 10 and 12 are dealing crack cocaine, heroin and other substances for a sub-cell of the Kinahan cartel.
Detectives believe the children are terrified of the violent young criminals who have links to the cartel.
They risk severe beatings or worse if they do not comply with orders.
The drugs are being sourced by gangsters based in Kevin Street, Crumlin and the Bride Street area.
Another area of concern to gardaí is the Basin Street flats complex, where juvenile drug dealers have been operating openly for associates of jailed gangland killer Brian Rattigan.
In September 2018, a Dublin GAA club warned of a crack cocaine epidemic developing in its area, with criminal gangs grooming children as young as 13 to push drugs.
A year ago this week, the country was shocked when a 17-year-old boy was murdered in Drogheda and his body dismembered.
Gardaí said he had been the victim of grooming.
The teen had been displaying the trappings of wealth associated with gang culture, particularly designer clothes, even though he had no legitimate source of income.
The Justice Minister intends that grooming a child for criminal activity will be prosecutable as a separate offence to any crime committed by an adult using a child as an agent.
"We must tackle crime at all levels and in all areas of our society, from stopping the gang bosses committing the most awful crimes to preventing them leading our young into a life of crime," she said
"Rooting crime out of our communities means we must show criminals we are deadly serious.
"Breaking the link between criminal gangs and the vulnerable young people they try to recruit will be essential if we are to divert young people away from lives of crime."

Schools on alert after men 'inappropriately' hacked Zoom class

Schools are on alert to IT security risks over online classes as a garda investigation gets under way into how a number of men gained unauthorised access to a lesson for second-year students.
The breach, at a Co Meath school on Wednesday, was made worse when the men acted inappropriately.
Gardaí have confirmed the Divisional Protective Services Unit, whose areas of responsibility include alleged offences around child protection, is investigating.
Another second-level school has reported to parents that a number of online classes have been disrupted by pupils themselves.
The principal of the south Dublin school sent an email yesterday advising that a minority of students "have been disrespectful to staff, disrupted live lessons by shouting out inappropriately, changed their names to inappropriate ones and dropped their video so as to annotate the screen disrespectfully".
He added: "This behaviour is completely inappropriate and is disrupting the education that we are trying to provide as well as affecting the well-being of staff and students alike.
"As a response, staff are up-skilling and reassessing their approach to lesson planning and delivery."
Serious
The principal referred to "a small number of more serious class disruptions" and said "all appropriate actions have been taken and the relevant authorities have been reported to by the college to ensure they won't happen again".
He did not provide any information about the nature of the "more serious class disruptions" or the "relevant authorities" to which the school has reported the matter.
The principal asked students not to share access codes for the Zoom video conferencing platform and added that "unless otherwise informed, the camera must be turned on with the full name and their live image on the screen".
Parents have been asked to discuss the matter with their children.
More than 900,000 pupils returned to remote teaching and learning this week.
While there are anecdotal reports of disruption to online classes elsewhere, education authorities said they did not believe it was a widespread problem.
However, the incident in the Co Meath school, during a class on the Microsoft Teams platform, set alarm bells ringing.
Co Galway principal Daniel Hyland, who is a member of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) executive, sent an email to regional colleagues advising that they contact their ICT support com-panies.

Shelves will be empty - Brexit 'hasn't hit yet'

An Irish freight group has warned of huge post-Brexit disruption to supply chains in coming weeks as the impact of Britain leaving the EU takes hold.
The Freight Transport Association of Ireland (FTAI) wrote to Taoiseach Micheál Martin, warning him of empty supermarket shelves, job losses and rising prices unless the Government takes action to help the industry bring goods into the country.
The letter, signed by FTAI general manager Aidan Flynn, said the industry was struggling to keep the flow of goods moving.
Backlog
"There is a growing backlog of goods of all hues, from mechanical parts (car parts) to electrical household goods, furniture, clothing, food supplies, sitting in depots because there are not enough agents to process the declarations correctly," the group said.
"There are issues with the systems and there are problems with providing enough support and guidance on the new requirements to industry to make this work.
"The net result will be that companies operating on very tight margins will cease trading, creating unemployment, supply lines will disappear and the consumer will be left with less supply and increased prices."
The association said stockpiling before Christmas had masked some of the effects of Brexit so far.
Mr Martin said the Government and businesses are managing very damaging developments in the wake of Brexit.
He said these include considerable change and greater complexity, especially anyone doing business with Great Britain.
The Taoiseach said the agreement reached between the EU and the UK on Christmas Eve was the "least bad" version of Brexit.

Struggling hospitals face falling staff levels

Hospitals across the country are coming under increasing pressure as the number of Covid-19 patients escalates amid crippling staff shortages.
As of yesterday there were 1,850 people hospitalised with the virus and 184 in intensive care units.
Thirty-two intensive care beds were available nationwide, across both adult and paediatric units. More than 100 people with Covid-19 were on ventilators.
It comes as more hospitals reach into their surge capacity by redeploying non-specialist staff to critical care roles and converting wards into intensive care areas to accommodate seriously ill patients.
There are currently about 4,000 staff from acute hospitals absent from work due to Covid-19; either because they have contracted the virus themselves, or because they are a close contact of a confirmed case.
Last night, trade union Siptu warned Covid-19 infection rates of health care workers are unsustainable and putting the safe functioning of the health service in grave danger.
"This level of infection is completely unsustainable," said Siptu health division organiser Kevin Figgis.
"Health workers across all grades are being decimated while this virus is raging out of control across our health service.
"It is clear that health care workers are not safe in work and the current rate of infection is putting the safe functioning of the service in grave danger.
"We are again calling for the immediate recruitment of additional and essential staff to assist all health workers on the front line."
Yesterday, a group of nurses and doctors at Nenagh Hospital appeared in an online video demanding they receive the potentially life-saving vaccine as they were treating Covid patients.
The video showed staff pleading with Taoiseach Micheál Martin as well as Health Minister Stephen Donnelly to sanction the rollout of the vaccine in Nenagh.
Staff complained the rollout was well under way in its sister hospitals University Hospital Limerick, Ennis Hospital, and University Maternity Hospital Limerick.
Critical
UL Hospitals Group later confirmed that about 20 theatre staff based at Nenagh Hospital are to receive the vaccine, but will be redeployed to University Hospital Limerick (UHL) to support the hospital as it opens critical care surge capacity.
Meanwhile, management at the same group apologised to patients after it emerged that some were waiting more than 100 hours for a bed at UHL.
UHL has the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country at 150. Yesterday there were only three beds available in the hospital's 28-bed Critical Care Unit, where 13 patients with Covid-19 are being treated. A recently opened 60-bed block is mostly full with Covid-19 patients.
On Thursday, a UHL source said some patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) were waiting on trolleys for more than 100 hours.
The source claimed there were up to "94 people in the department" at one stage last Wednesday afternoon.
Those admitted to the ED were on trolleys in corridors "on top of one another", and, it was "impossible to maintain social distancing".
In response, a UL Hospitals spokesman said: "The Emergency Department at UHL has been very busy during this current challenging phase of the pandemic and we apologise to admitted patients who have faced long waits for beds.
"Hospitals around the country are under significant strain at present and our staff are making enormous efforts to keep patients safe."
Due to "significant community transmission in the mid-west and multiple outbreaks in healthcare settings across the region" it is "constrained in effecting inter-hospital transfers, discharges to community settings and discharges home".
The spokesman said this "is having a considerable impact on patient flow in UHL contributing to long waits for patients in ED".

Tax perks for people working from home

A new package of tax incentives to encourage people to work from home will be rolled out in the next Budget, the Tánaiste has confirmed.
Leo Varadkar promised improvements in the current regime that allows workers claim tax reliefs worth an average of around €30 to €100 per year.
Employers can pay a €3.20-per-day allowance, but most do not.
Mr Varadkar outlined details of a new Government strategy on remote working that will include a legal right for employees to ask to work from home permanently.
It also promises better protections for workers to enable them to disconnect from work after hours.
"At the moment, you can receive a tax-free payment of €3.20 a day from your employer for home working, or you can have some of your expenses - utilities, for example - reimbursed," Mr Varadkar said.
"But it's intended that as part of the Budget package in October, there will be a new package of tax incentives and expenses to encourage people to work from home.
"So you will see an improvement there in what's currently in place."
The Tánaiste said the Government also needs to examine ways it can help out employers.
He said in the medium to long-term, remote working could reduce business costs.
However, a lot of employers had told him they are "kind of stuck with both" costs of renting office space and supporting employees working from home.
"At the moment, they have the cost of the rent and utilities on the office, and they're also covering some of the costs of people working at home," he said.
Meanwhile, workers who refuse to check emails and take calls out of hours are promised better legal protection in the new Government plan.

Where are we in race to vaccinate, and have any side-effects been noted?

Hospitals are full, new and more infectious variants of coronavirus are stalking us and there is no clear end to lockdown in sight.
It's no wonder the only boost to the spirits is the Covid-19 vaccine - it's just that there are not enough jabs to go around yet.
So where are we in the race to vaccinate?
First doses
The roll-out is still in the first dose stage. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots.
According to the HSE, 133,000 vaccines will have been distributed by this weekend. Figures released this week said 77,303 people were inoculated and one in 10 was in long-term care.
The majority are frontline healthcare workers although it is unclear how hospitals are being prioritised.
All long-term care facilities were to have received a first dose by tomorrow week.
Outbreaks
Long-term care facilities have been hit by outbreaks in the third wave and vaccinations have been carried out on residents and staff in some on people who were not infected.
Nursing Homes Ireland said every vaccination in a home is absolutely vital because the people there are so susceptible to the virus.
The over-65 cohort are the only group who have not seen a fall in infections in recent days. They are most at risk of illness and death.
Freeing up vaccines
The decision to extend the gap between the first and second dose of the Pfizer vaccine from 21 days to 28 days will free up around a week's supply. The first dose provides a limited shield but the two doses are needed to have 95pc protection.
Slow down
Pfizer feared the slow down in deliveries would extend from later this month into early February.
However, it was confirmed later it is limited to next week.
It now appears it will have a modest impact on the plan to have 700,000 people vaccinated by the end March.
The hope is that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine will be approved at the end of the month and as this is easier to handle could be administered by GPs.
Side effects
The HPRA said the small number of reported adverse reactions to the vaccine so far have not raised concern.
They are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

'We're out on our feet, it is carnage here', nurses warn

Medical staff have been battling to cope with the "carnage" in hospitals since Christmas because of the explosion in Covid-19 cases.
One junior doctor said that nurses, medics and support staff in Cork University Hospital (CUH) are now "out on their feet" exhausted trying to cope with the combination of soaring cases and having to work longer as staff stay home ill.
A staff member at University Hospital Limerick (UHL) - which recorded the most Covid-19 cases of any acute hospital - warned that they felt "overwhelmed".
UHL had the highest number of confirmed cases (142) of any hospital in the country followed by CUH (139), Galway University Hospital (127), St Vincent's Hospital Dublin (123) and Drogheda Hospital (110).
Only three critical care beds were left available at UHL.
Twelve seriously ill Covid-19 patients were being treated at the 28-bed critical care unit.
A UL Hospitals spokesperson confirmed there were "a total of 574 staff across UL Hospitals Group unavailable for work due to Covid-19".
More than 4,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in Limerick over the past two weeks.
CUH is one of six acute hospitals struggling to cope with more than 100 Covid-19 cases.
A total of 1,686 patients are being treated in hospitals for the virus.
Crisis
At one point, more than 140 CUH staff, including 100 nurses, were off work having either tested positive or having been a close contact of a positive case.
A further 14 hospitals have each got 50 or more cases.
The CUH junior doctor - who asked to be unnamed - said staff were called to a meeting and briefed that they were now facing "the peak crisis of the entire pandemic".
"There are times you look around and you wonder how much more pressure the system can take. You can see the strain on the faces of doctors and nurses," they said.
"It has been very tough. It was tough last April when the first wave peaked but this has been something else."
Even medical rotations have effectively been suspended as doctors struggle to cope with soaring patient numbers.
"The commitment of doctors, nurses, hospital support staff and managers has been incredible, but you can see the toll it is taking on everyone," the source said.
"I left a ward a few days ago and went into a store room to find a nurse crying.
"I still don't know if it was exhaustion, stress or worry about a loved one with Covid."
Junior doctors have borne the brunt of the pandemic third wave by working longer hours, taking extra shifts to cover for sick colleagues and postponing leave.
"A few of my classmates opted to work as junior doctors in Australia and New Zealand and their work demands are like night-and-day compared to ours.
"When I chat to them on social media and explain what it has been like here since Christmas, they just can't believe it.
The UHL staff member admitted the situation was challenging. "The last two weeks it has gone ballistic. There are areas of the hospital full of Covid patients.
"We have doubled down on numbers; in corridors they are on top of one another.
"It's impossible to maintain social distancing in the ED, and staff are demoralised and overwhelmed," they added.
Some 2,400 staff across the group's UHL, Ennis Hospital and University Limerick Maternity Hospital facilities have received the first of two vaccine doses.
"Ultimately, the vaccine will be rolled out across all hospitals in UL Hospitals Group," a UL Hospitals spokesman said.

23 deaths in a month down to patients getting virus in a hospital

As many as 23 patients have died this month after picking up Covid-19 in a hospital, it emerged last night.
It follows revelations by the HSE that in some unnamed hospitals, which have suffered major outbreaks of the virus, half the patients with Covid-19 caught it after admission with another illness.
The pattern of deaths in recent months indicates one-third of fatalities may be due to outbreaks in hospitals and the others are linked to nursing homes and community settings.
The stark findings come as 28 more deaths were reported yesterday, bringing the fatality toll to 208 this month.
The youngest person who died was just 25 and the oldest 98.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn last night warned there will be "difficult days ahead" as more people succumb to the virus in significant numbers.
However, there are now growing fears that a return to the workplace in high numbers will jeopardise the slowing down of the spread of the virus seen in recent days.
Prof Philip Nolan, who tracks the virus, told the Department of Health briefing that the daily number of new infections was 3,955 and we are seeing the beginning of a reduction in case numbers.
It is essential that we "keep this up" for long periods of time but Google location data for January 10 showed the level of attendance at workplaces was at 50pc, much higher than in the first lockdown.
"The concern is that over the next week people will be asked back in the workplace or they will drift back."
He appealed to employers to facilitate people to do their job at home and he asked people to abide by public health advice to work from home.
"If that does not happen and people don't keep the reduction in their social contacts to the levels they have been doing in the next week to 10 days then the decline in case numbers will not be maintained and the expected recovery in our hospital system we expect to see in the next few weeks will not happen."
Asked about the reopening of schools from February, Dr Glynn said while they were "very safe environments" the issue was the higher level of mobility they generate.
He said it will be necessary to see how the virus is spreading in the coming days before making recommendations.
Struggling hospitals are unlikely to see a peak for another seven days and they will be under intense pressure for weeks because of the length of time it takes to treat the disease.
Liam Woods, who oversees hospitals in the HSE, said there were 321 intensive care beds open yesterday with a capacity to increase the number to 350.
Worry
Prof Nolan said "even if things go well" there could be 800 Covid-19 patients in hospital at the end of the month with 100 to 120 in intensive care.
Around 23 people a day are now dying from Covid-19 related illness, having increased sharply, and there is a particular worry that while the incidence of the virus is falling in other age groups it is plateauing among the over- 65s.
The R number, indicating how fast the virus is spreading, is now around 1 or 1.3.
Dr Glynn said nobody is immune from the disease and one in three people in intensive care is under the age of 65.
The UK variant, which is more infectious, now makes up around half the cases and it continues to gain ground.
Dr Cillian De Gascun of the National Virus Reference Laboratory said: "It is not unusual for viruses to mutate.
"We have identified multiple different SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Ireland, and two of the three recently emerged variants of concern from the UK and South Africa."

Currie reveals 'hairy moments' in coronavirus battle

A Fine Gael senator has detailed her experience with Covid-19, which saw her isolated in her room for days on end while her young children cried out for their mother.
Emer Currie tested positive for the virus in October. When she first started coughing, the Dublin politician did not believe she had been infected with the virus, but went for a test as a precaution.
However, by the time the positive result came back, her cough had become more persistent and she was suffering a shortness of breath.
"There is a split second when you think your breath should come back to you and it doesn't, and that isn't nice. There were some hairy moments," she told Independent.ie's Floating Voter podcast.
Once she received her diagnosis, the mother-of-two young daughters confined herself to her bedroom, where she worked on constituency queries.
However, beyond the bedroom door, normal family life continued and Ms Currie could only listen.
Tears
"The toughest part is when the kids are tired and they want mummy to put them to bed and you can't, or if they wake up in the middle of the night and want a cuddle," she said.
"There were lots of tears because they didn't understand why they can't have just this one reassuring cuddle from their mum."
In line with HSE guidelines, the senator contacted the Leinster House human resources department to let them know she had tested positive.
Three of her Fine Gael colleagues were asked to self-isolate because they were deemed close contacts.
"It is not a nice experience to be worried about your family, worried about your colleagues, to be worried about the kids and whether or not one of them picked something up in school or whether they would pass it on to somebody," she said.
Ms Currie admitted she did experience "return-to-work dread", but was very thankful that there was "no finger-wagging or finger-pointing" in Leinster House when she returned after recovering from the virus.
"Colleagues were very discreet and my party colleagues were very supportive," she said.
Masks
Ms Currie urged people to follow the guidelines while continuing to regularly wash their hands and wear face masks in public settings.
"I don't know how I picked it up, but I know I didn't pass it on because I was following the guidelines," she said.

Foley urged to overhaul leaving cert

Pressure is growing on Education Minster Norma Foley to consider an alternative to the traditional Leaving Cert.
Several TDs raised the issue with the minister in the Dáil yesterday, with some supp- orting a return to calculated grades this year or a "hybrid model", and all seeking an early decision on the fate of the exams.
A survey of more than 20,000 members of the Irish Second-Level Students Union (ISSU) is expected to show an appetite for change from normal arrangements.
The findings are due to be released over the weekend, but ISSU president Reuban Murray last night gave a clear indication of the mood.
He said up to now the conversation had been around how the exams were going to happen, but it had to move to a place where the discussions were not solely focusing on that.
Against a groundswell for an alternative to be found, teacher unions have reiterated their support for the trad- itional exams.
The Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI) said "the highly trusted, externally-marked Leaving Certificate must take place in 2021".
It added: "Our experience of calculated grades last year has left the union in no doubt that the customary state examinations are more reliable and enjoy significantly greater trust among the public at large and, critically, among stud-ents and teachers."
Earlier, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) president Ann Piggott said the Leaving Cert exams should run as normal in June.
Breakthrough
She was responding to a call from Fianna Fáil senator Timmy Dooley, who said the "best worst option" would be the cancellation of Leaving Cert 2021 because the virus made it highly unlikely that students would enjoy the same face-to-face teaching time that would usually take place between now and June.
More attention turned to the Leaving Cert after a breakthrough that may see pupils with special needs back in school from next Thursday in the first phase of a post-Christmas return.
After a meeting between Ms Foley, junior minister for special education Josepha Madigan and the education partners, the ministers said they had a "shared ambition" for a reopening of special schools and special classes in primary schools on January 21.
It may be the following week in post-primary schools.
Schools may also bring back children with special needs who do not participate in special classes and other vulner- able children.
Ms Foley said she also "very much" hoped that the ongoing negotiations would set out a pathway for the return of all children at all levels of schooling at the start of February.
This would be subject to public health advice.

The HSE has defended the use of non-critical care nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) saying it is "better than the alternative".
Ireland's ICUs are coming under huge pressure due to the surge in admissions of patients with Covid-19.
Last night there were 169 people in ICU as well as around 210 patients in ordinary wards who require non-invasive advanced respiratory support.
The Herald yesterday reported on the concerns of senior ICU medics that non-specialist staff were being deployed to help the most critically ill patients.
Dr Enda O'Connor, director of ICU in St James's Hospital said he was happy to have the staff - who have been given training in the core aspects of ICU care - but they are "working outside their comfort zones".
At the Mater Hospital, Serena O'Brien, clinical nurse manager in critical care, hospital said the situation is "scary".
Skilled
She spoke of how critical care nursing is a highly skilled profession and said: "You are asking a nurse to come in and look after a ventilator.
"They have never seen one. They haven't a clue. How would they?
"They have a different skillset out on the ward."
At a HSE press conference the organisation's chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry said the core capacity in ICU is 286 beds and that there is up to 350 available to cater for a surge in admissions.
He said the HSE believes the same quality of care can be provided for if the full 350 capacity is used, but it is reliant on redeploying staff from other services.
Dr Henry added: "Clearly we would be in a better position if we never had to expand intensive care capacity to go into surge with Covid-19."
But he said the development of that capacity with redeployed staff "enables us to provide care".
"It's better than the alternative," he said.

It's been a rough week for Stephen Kenny, with the loss of Damien Duff and Alan Kelly - and I don't know their reasons - from the Ireland coaching staff.
It's been a rough week for Stephen Kenny, with the loss of Damien Duff and Alan Kelly - and I don't know their reasons - from the Ireland coaching staff.
Now, when it comes to finding two new members of his backroom team, he needs to stop thinking about what people on the outside think and just do it his own way, not just pick someone because they've played for Ireland but to pick the right person for the job, he has to pick someone he knows, who knows him.
Stephen has gone down the route of having internationally-experienced coaches, in Keith Andrews and Damien Duff, but what he's not had is someone he has worked with for a long time, someone he trusts and someone who knows him inside out.
And Vinny Perth could be that person. Vinny has been around the block, he's worked with Stephen and knows how he works. He doesn't have the international experience that everyone is crying out for, but maybe Stephen needs something different. He has had the staff with that high-level international experience and the results haven't come so maybe Stephen needs to do things his own way, with people he knows well, who he trusts.
If you are going to fail in a job, any job, you don't want to go away with regrets about not having the right people around you. Kenny had had success before with Vinny and if this doesn't work out this time, at least he will know he's given it his best shot with the people he wants.
I don't think the players in the squad will have any issue with a staff member. As a player your first questions are what's his background, what's he done in the game? That doubt in a player's mind is natural in any scenario. But there is an opportunity for someone to come in and take Damien's place, to prove themselves to the players.
You can't walk in and think the players will fall at your feet, you need to win them over and win their respect but Stephen Kenny has done it, he has the respect of the players, and someone else, like Vinny Perth, could too.

Liverpool need to silence doubters with United win

Manchester United are top of the Premier League table. But they are still not a title-winning team, though.
It's good for the Premier League overall that United are up there and making it into a challenge, the league needs the big clubs making a challenge and if it can be a three-horse race this year it will be more exciting.
But when it comes to a real push, with four or five games to go, I still see it being Liverpool and Manchester City as the two challengers, and that's even if United manage to get a result at Anfield on Sunday.
If you look at the period where Solskjaer has been at United, there is just that history of inconsistency, in what they have done and how they have played.
I can see the progress they have made and they are improving, but they haven't improved that much, between the end of last season and now, to be considered title contenders. Yes, they have had a good run and this will be seen as a good season for them, but they need a few more players to become a proper team.
You can't just wave a magic wand for a team to become Premier League title challengers: United are a good side and they should be able to secure a place in the top four, which would have been the goal at the start of the season, but when it comes down to it, Manchester City and Liverpool are streets ahead of them.
Solskjaer has to be commended for what he has done with United and he has earned the right to go again next season, to give him a summer transfer window to try and get them to the next level, which is winning a title, but I don't see them doing it this year.
They badly need a centre back. Eric Bailly complements Maguire, but his time at United has been blighted by inconsistency and errors, you always fear he'll make a slip so United need a quick, reliable, central defender who can play 38 games a season, is always fit, doesn't make mistakes, if they do that they won't be far off, bar another centre forward, if they have those two added in they have a potentially very strong team but at the minute they don't have that bit of quality they need to push on.
You hope it's an enjoyable game on Sunday. We all saw the last Manchester derby in the league and both teams were so focused on not losing, it was a very boring game.
And with United winning their last game, they don't need to win on Sunday, they have made their statement already by going top of the table, so United will play the way they did against Man City, they'll sit off, try and hit City on the counterattack and be content with a draw. They'll be happy to get a point at Anfield and that poses the question whether Liverpool can break them down.
Liverpool badly need to get that zest back into their play, the intensity they had for so long but have been lacking now for a few weeks. Liverpool will see this as an opportunity to say: we haven't gone away, we're still the best team in the country, and our focus is on retaining the league.
It's as if Liverpool need to make a point as people are starting to doubt them on the back of their results, people are wondering if they're no longer the side they used to be. And it's up to Liverpool to be the side who make an impact in this game. If Liverpool hit form and play the way we know they can, they should deal with United.
But if they are lethargic, slow in their buildup, United are strong enough throughout and have that pace up front to try and hit them on the break, and that's Liverpool's worst nightmare, to drop off the top of the table and then lose to United in the space of a week. That would be a real sign of concern.
United are more consistent now than they had been. That Burnley game in midweek, I'm sure that's a game where United would have slipped up two or three months ago but they got a decent win. The selection Solskjaer had against Burnley was very smart, he picked a tall team to combat what they were up against. United dug in and battled hard, and then got the ball down and played a bit more in the second half, showed their qualities and the Burnley performance was a very mature one from United, a performance that showed a lot of progress from where they had been previously.
The so-called lesser teams, like Burnley, drop off and let them play, and if United can get into a rhythm they are very good. But on Sunday Liverpool will look to press them up high, and United still have mistakes in them, especially at the back.
I don't see United winning the league. Liverpool have been unbelievable for two and a half years, been on top all along, won the league, the Champions League, they were bound to have a dip and this is their dip.
And even with their drop in form and the loss of their key defenders, they're still only three points off. They will come back strong and they will finish ahead of United, but if they do drop off and it's a top two of Man United and Man City, it will be over with two or three games to go.

Broadcaster Mairead Ronan is off air and in isolation after her husband and their two young daughters were all diagnosed with Covid-19.
Mairead's husband, businessman Louis Ronan, and the couple's daughters, Bonnie (2) and Eliza (4), all tested positive for coronavirus over a period of eight days and are recuperating at home in Clontarf.
However, the 40-year-old broadcaster, who has been off the air at Today FM for the last week-and-a-half to care for her family, has so far escaped infection.
"I have been tested three times and I am completely negative," she told the Herald.
"I clearly have some sort of immunity to it because I haven't got it despite the fact that I was in the same bed as Louis. He was breathing all over me, I didn't get it and I still don't have it.
"That's three in the house who got it and myself and my 13-year-old son, Dara, both tested negative.
"We have been so careful all year but it's just everywhere.
"We were just unlucky and picked it up in the community. Louis was diagnosed on Monday last week, Bonnie was diagnosed two days later and Eliza tested positive two days ago.
"I could have cried when Eliza was diagnosed on Tuesday but thankfully, she is OK.
"I feel so disappointed because we have been so careful. That is almost the annoying part.
"I haven't seen my family since Christmas day but it is what it is.
"I am mystified because we were all so careful. I know what it takes to be careful and then it arrives, it is in my house."

Moneylenders facing cap on interest rates

The interest rate that moneylenders can charge may soon be capped.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe revealed he is reviewing submissions made to his department calling for a cap on the high interest rates the doorstep lenders can legally impose.
Licensed moneylenders typically charge more than 86pc.
Some charge up to 288pc once collection charges are added in.
It is estimated there are 380,000 customers of moneylenders in Ireland.
There are 38 lenders licensed by the Central Bank, while the average loan is around €500.
Restrictions
Mr Donohoe told Labour's finance spokesman Ged Nash his department is currently reviewing the submissions made after it undertook a public consultation in 2019 seeking views on capping the cost of licensed moneylenders.
The majority of submissions called for the introduction of interest rate restrictions.
"A number of potential policy proposals have been prepared in light of these submissions and I am currently reviewing a draft report setting out these proposals, which I hope to publish in the coming months," Mr Donohoe said.
He said there would be a need to balance fairness for borrowers with a need to ensure that moneylenders do not stop offering their services.
The minister said there was a "potential for unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion if the supply of credit is reduced".
Mr Nash said: "The extortion has to end and the minister must act fast to bring in a market-wide cap on interest rates charged by moneylenders."

RTÉ records annual loss of €7.2m as broadcaster 'fights for survival' despite job cuts

RTÉ suffered a net deficit of €7.2m in 2019 according to the year's annual report released yesterday.
However, this was an improvement on 2018 when the net deficit after tax and exceptional items for the year was €13m.
The public broadcaster attributed the lower deficit in part to special events like the Rugby World Cup and local and European elections - which brought in around €4.1m.
It also saw a modest increase in its total revenue to €342.1m, which is about €3m more than in 2018.
However, there was a slight decrease in commercial revenue due to "Brexit uncertainty and changes in media consumption habits".
Director-general of RTÉ Dee Forbes said staff had worked hard in 2019 to create more original content on the RTÉ Player, diversifying into podcasts and streaming and repurposing their journalism for all platforms.
"While there was a lot to be proud of in 2019, it was a year that ended with sadness as we lost our dear friend and colleague, Gay Byrne," she said.
The RTÉ Player saw a growth of 20pc in viewing in 2019, with RTÉ television having 42 of the top 50 most-watched programmes of the year.
Almost two million radio listeners tuned in to RTÉ weekly, with 51.9pc of the adult population listening to it every week in 2019.
However, chair of the RTÉ board Moya Doherty said the year proved to be yet another tough one for the media sector.
"While public-service providers, including RTÉ, made great efforts to continue to adapt and change to retain and remain relevant to audiences, the reality is that we continue to fight for our survival as the need for trusted, independent, quality journalism and programming has never been more important," she said.
She added: "In 2019 we came face to face with how a lack of funding reform and legislative planning is threatening a public-service platform that is central to our sense of selves, our communities, our cultures and our global voice."
In November 2019, RTÉ announced it would cut around 200 jobs in 2020 as part of a plan to reduce costs by €60m over three years.
However, in November last year it indicated it would not seek the full 200 job cuts.
Criticism
In October, it said an additional 60 staff would be given the option to leave voluntarily with severance packages from January 11.
The company also wanted to reduce the salaries of some of its top contracted on-air presenters by 15pc.
RTÉ has come in for criticism for the amount it pays senior broadcasters, with the most recent figures from 2016 showing the highest paid was Ryan Tubridy, who received €450,000.
The 2016 figures were released in 2018.
RTÉ was originally going to release more updated figures last year but announced in mid-December 2020 that the figures were being delayed until 2021.

Second Trump impeachment trial takes US into uncharted waters

The United States will be in unknown territory when the Senate meets as soon as next week for the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump.
The House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to impeach Trump on charges of incitement after his supporters rampaged in the Capitol.
The violence followed a speech in which he urged them to fight president-elect Joe Biden's election victory.
Trump falsely claims he lost due to voting fraud.
Diana DeGette, one of nine Democratic impeachment managers who will argue the House's case against Trump, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was working out with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when to transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate, triggering the trial process.
"This is a situation where you have the crime pretty much being committed on national television," DeGette said. "It's a shockingly evident case."
In a 232-197 vote on Wednesday, Trump became the first president to be impeached twice and will likely be the first to face an impeachment trial after leaving office.
Protected
Ten Republicans joined the majority Democrats in supp- orting impeachment, while others said Trump's remarks were protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, which defends free speech.
The action is unlikely to lead to Trump's ouster before Biden takes office next Wednesday.
McConnell has said no trial could begin until the Senate was scheduled to be back in regular session on Tuesday.
If Trump has left the White House, the Senate could convict him and vote to ban him from running for office again.
Democrat Biden has urged Senate leaders not to allow the impeachment trial to get in the way of other priorities, such as an economic stimulus bill and coronavirus vaccine distribution improvements.
Biden's inauguration has been scaled back due to security concerns and the Covid pandemic.
The article of impeachment charges Trump with "incitement of insurrection" in his incendiary speech to thousands of supporters last week.
The mob disrupted Congress's certification of Biden's victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead, including a police officer.
A two-thirds majority in the Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to join the Democrats.
If Trump is no longer president, the Senate could disqualify him from holding office in the future with only a simple majority vote.
In the trial, Trump's legal team may argue his comments were not a call to violence and were protected under the First Amendment.
"Even if his speech was protected, he can still be impeached," said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. "High-ranking officials get fired for their speech all the time."

The winter weather is set to continue, with Met Éireann forecasting colder temperatures from next Tuesday.
While today and tomorrow it will be mainly dry for most of the country, it's set to get colder and wetter.
However, according to a Met Éireann forecaster it will not be extreme.
"At the moment, there's no indication of any severe cold weather in the next 10 days," he said.
"The overall picture is that we do expect it to get colder from Tuesday."
Today it will be largely dry with the exception of light showers in west Munster, Connacht and Ulster.
During the day, temperatures will reach seven to nine degrees, dropping to as low as -2 during the night.
Tomorrow will be mainly dry, with showers in Connacht and west Ulster in the early morning.
Flooding
Persistent rain is ex- pected to develop during the evening and reach the rest of the country at night.
According to Met Éireann, this month will be colder than average.
"We can see that with Friday night's forecast predicting widespread rain, which will be heavy at times leading to a possible risk of localised flooding," the forecaster said.
"Thankfully, the rain will clear from most places in the morning."

'Surge nurses' undertrained for ICU units as virus worsens

The redeployment of non-critical care nurses into daunting critical care roles is bringing intensive care units under increasing pressure as hospitals run out of options amidst increasing Covid-19 admissions.
It comes as hospitals across the country reach into their surge capacity by converting surgical wards and resuscitation areas into intensive care areas to accommodate patients needing critical care.
In St James's hospital in Dublin, where 18 Covid-19 patients were receiving intensive care treatment, demand for critical care nursing is currently outstripping supply, resulting in the reallocation of staff from other disciplines into the highly specialised area of critical care.
"Ultimately, there are less staff around for an increased amount of work," said Dr Enda O'Connor, director of ICU at St James's hospital in Dublin.
"An intensive care nurse is a very specialised member of staff and you can't just magic an intensive care nurse out of the ether.
"What we are having to do is, we are reallocating staff from non-intensive care parts of the hospital to work in intensive care. We are very grateful and delighted to have these staff and I want to be clear about that.
"They get training in the core aspects of looking after critically ill patients. But these are people who are working outside their comfort zones.
Pulled
"A lot of these staff are specialists, but in a different area. But that's what we have to do, we have to do the best we can."
At the Mater hospital, Dublin, nurses who trained in critical care up to a decade ago and later went into other specialties are being "pulled back in" to deal with the crisis.
The hospital, which has activated its surge plan by caring for some critically ill patients in its high dependency unit, is currently dealing with significant staffing issues.
Serena O'Brien, clinical nurse manager in critical care at the hospital, said the prospect of staffing an ICU with "surge nurses" - nurses redeployed from other areas of the hospital - was a daunting one.
"When we talk about staffing with surge, we are taking nurses into intensive care who have not got intensive care experience and I cannot begin to tell you how scary that is," she said.
Ms O'Brien, who is also chairperson of the Irish Association of Critical Care Nurses, acknowledged that some nurses around the country, who received limited training after the first surge will be plunged into daunting intensive care environments due to the third wave of Covid-19.
It is understood that staff in smaller hospitals have already been redeployed to intensive care nursing roles.
"Critical care nursing is a highly skilled profession," she said.
"You are asking a nurse to come in and look after a ventilator. They have never seen one. They haven't a clue.
"They wouldn't even know where the on/off button is. How would they?
"We are asking them to come into a completely different environment which is much more high-tech.
"Then we are going to throw a dialysis machine at them as well, then we are going to put them in PPE for 12 hours and tell them they can't come out of the room.
"If they're struggling, they have to wave at somebody walking by for help. This is scary."
In emphasising the complexities of the critical care nursing role, Ms O'Brien pointed out that staff undertake years of intensive education and training and that caring for an ICU patient requires one to one, 24/7 expertise.
Monitored
"A ventilator needs to be cared for and monitored 24/7," she said.
"There are parameters on that machine set specially for each patient and their lung condition at that time.
"We are recording those values on an hourly basis. That is just for supporting their lungs.
"They might also be on medication for blood pressure or dialysis because their kidneys often fail, particularly with Covid.
"That's why you need one nurse, 24/7, because it's not just caring for the patient, it's a multitude of devices surrounding the patient and supporting all of their organs around the clock."
On Monday, Dr Michael Power, HSE clinical lead for intensive care, said 1,300 nurses have received intensive care training since last April and they are now being identified so they can be approached and redeployed.
Meanwhile, in St James's, management initiated surge plans last week, according to Dr O'Connor.
"It's a phased process," he said.
"A step-wise plan, usually with five or six phases, depending on the hospital.
"We are actively planning the more advanced stages. What that means is that the intensive care is expanding into parts of the hospital at the moment that really, traditionally, are not intensive care areas at all."
Dr O'Connor said this involved reconfiguring areas like surgical wards into areas that can accommodate Covid patients, including critically ill patients on ventilators.
"It is essentially turning wards into temporary intensive care areas," he said.
"These are temporary, they are not as good as proper intensive care beds, for the simple reason that intensive care beds are strategically and purpose-built for the management of critically ill patients.
"We are doing the best we can with the limited infrastructure that we have.
"We have all the vital equipment that we need at the minute, things like ventilators and dialysis machines.
"The infrastructure is there, but it's suboptimal, there is no doubt about that.
Pummelled
"The equipment is there, but staffing is our biggest issue."
With a pummelled workforce that has already endured almost a year of battling Covid-19, there are concerns about the impact of sending inexperienced staff into intensive critical care environments.
"We have done a survey here locally and there was a high level of stress and anxiety for these nurses who were surge nurses during the first wave," said Ms O'Brien.
"That said, we do provide them with some basic education to help them get through. We have surge training ongoing, it's happening in all of the ICUs across the country.
Catherine Motherway, head of the ICU at the Mid-Western University Regional hospital in Limerick, warned that hospitals here are currently three weeks behind London.
"It is potentially very grim," she said.
"I think people need to look at what is happening in London because we are about three weeks behind them, but we can stop this.
"The only people who can stop this is the public. All we can do (healthcare staff) is respond to it."

'We have a long way to go' - Holohan's warning after 63 more deaths

Thousands of people with Covid-19 may be being missed and unaware they have the infection as the daily death toll from the virus continues to mount, it emerged yesterday.
More than 30,000 close contacts of the 11,584 people diagnosed with the virus this week have not been followed up for testing by the HSE because of pressures on the system and cuts enforced as cases have soared.
Although they have been informed they should restrict their movements and will be tested if they develop symptoms, a significant number will have picked up the virus and be unaware they are infected.
This puts them at risk of passing on what could be the more infectious UK variant.
Each infected person has an average of around three close contacts .
It comes as 63 more Covid-19 related deaths were reported yesterday, marking another tragic day after 46 fatalities on Tuesday.
Hospital wards and intensive care units were overwhelmed as admissions of coronavirus patients rose to 1,770, a jump of 133 in the previous 24 hours.
Doctors are desperately converting more beds into temporary intensive care units, but even these are becoming stretched.
Resilience
The number of newly diagnosed cases of the virus fell to 2,640 yesterday, but the pressure on hospitals is expected to extend well into February.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan warned "we have a long, long way to go".
"In the coming weeks ahead, we will need to draw upon our reserves of resilience from springtime as we can expect to see hospitalisations, admissions to intensive care and mortality related to Covid-19 increase day on day.
"The best way that we can all support one another now is to stay apart.
"Sadly, what we are seeing now is a result of the very high daily confirmed case numbers we experienced for successive weeks.
"To ensure our hospitals and loved ones remain protected and stay alive to receive the vaccine, please continue to follow public health advice and stay home."
He appealed to people who have urgent symptoms for illnesses not related to Covid-19 to seek medical help.
"At this challenging time, it is important to remind those that need acute care that hospitals are there for those that need them.
"No one should ignore any worrying signs that may need medical attention, such as lumps, chest pain or other new symptoms.
"Phone your GP if you have any concerns, not just those related to Covid-19," Dr Holohan said.
Attacks
It is estimated there were around 2,000 missed cancers during the first months of the pandemic and cardiologists warned the failure of patients attending with heart attacks and strokes left them without life-saving treatment.
The HSE is now having to call back to work some staff who were close contacts of a confirmed case because of absences across hospitals and the health system which are now as high as 7,000. The staff are tested and monitored.
The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation said there is a "national emergency and we are at the point where staff are not able to cope".
"There are huge numbers of very sick patients. Over 2,500 healthcare workers a week are getting the virus.
"Decisions at every level are happening too late to prevent infection and overburden."

1916 group's vision for Moore Street

Campaigners hoping to regenerate Dublin's historic Moore Street have released an artist's impression of their proposed master plan that would pave the way for the area to become a historic heritage quarter.
The images, released yesterday, are what campaigner Patrick Cooney of the Save 16 Moore Street Committee and the 1916 Relatives Group described as "just a sneak preview to get people interested".
The project was commissioned by the campaigners following consultations with Irish architectural firms and planning consultants to transform the area into a mixed-use district combining retail, residential and heritage features.
Neglect
"They believe the master plan will not only reverse decades of official neglect but also act as a catalyst for the future regeneration of the city's north side," Mr Cooney said.
The project would involve the State using a compulsory purchase order to buy the historic 1916 terrace and other buildings where the GPO garrison fled and eventually surrendered during the Easter Rising.
"Apartments and small business incubator units will sit alongside specifically designated cultural venues and the 1916 revolution trail," Mr Cooney said.
"New builds including apartments will be carefully woven into the architectural scale and style of the existing site."
The committee will meet with Heritage Minister Darragh O'Brien in the coming weeks to discuss the proposal with an advisory group that is looking at developing the Moore Street battleground as a historic cultural quarter.
Mr Cooney told the Herald the Moore Street area had suffered from "50 years of neglect, dereliction and bad planning decisions".
"These buildings are of national importance," he said. "We can't allow them to decay any longer."

Builder Cairn Homes has sold 150 homes in Lucan to Irish investment management firm Carysfort Capital and Wall Street financial giant Angelo Gordon for €48.6m.
This works out at €324,000 per unit for the mix of apartments and duplexes at the Shackleton Park development.
The homes, which have yet to be completed, will be rented out.
Cairn sold 229 new homes last year to a so-called cuckoo fund controlled by Angelo Gordon at the same development, which comprises more than 1,100 new homes.
Cairn said two additional large private rental sector projects under construction will be marketed for sale later this year.
The company said it expects to report operating profits of around €24m for 2020, down from €68m in 2019.
Cairn closed 743 new homes sales last year and generated total revenues of around €260m in what the company said was a "stop-start year".
Strong
The company said it reduced its average selling price to €332,000, excluding VAT, from €372,000 in 2019.
It has around €980m in inventories, which includes around €690m of land held for development.
"The number of new homes we have completed and our profitability in 2020, allied with our large 2021 order book, are all strong endorsements of our business model," said Cairn co-founder and CEO Michael Stanley.
The company said it will "increase our unit sales and profitability in 2021".
It refrained from providing any guidance on its expected performance this year until it announces its 2020 preliminary results on March 4.
Shares in the company were trading up just under 2pc on Euronext Dublin yesterday.

More than a dozen local community groups catering to Ireland's youth have been awarded a portion of a €100,000 corporate donation to offset isolation and other challenges thrown up by the pandemic.
A total of 13 community organisations, both north and south of the Border, were announced yesterday as the recipients of the Coca-Cola Thank You Fund.
Organisers of the fund, now in its 10th year, encouraged community groups working with young people to apply for the grants of €5,000 and €10,000.
This year they focused on those disproportionately affected by the social and economic hardships due to the pandemic.
Pitch
A record number of applications were received across all 32 counties, in which 23 organisations were shortlisted and invited to make a pitch to the online judging panel.
The initiative was aimed at projects for 16 to 25-year-olds that are designed to "help build their resilience, meet the education gaps that exist and tackle the mental health challenges they're facing today and will continue to face".
Seven of the successful candidates will receive a grant of €10,000 each, including Enactus Ireland Dublin, for its 'Live Like Never Before Project'.
It challenges third-level students to develop social entrepreneurial projects to ensure healthy lifestyles and promote well-being among vulnerable people in their community.
Other recipients include the nationwide BeLonG To Youth Services providing support to LGBTI youth during the pandemic and lockdowns.
The national network of migrant women, Akina Dada Wa Africa (Sister from Africa), was also awarded the grant to fund its Young Migrant Women Project. AkiDwA supports women between the ages of 18-25, especially during the pandemic.
Six other organisations, including the Dublin City Farm and Ecology Centre, will get €5,000 for their projects.

Tommy Bowe: 'live TV is like running out in front of 80,000' Bowe with co-presenter Karen Koster

Tommy Bowe has said fronting a live television morning show on Virgin Media gives him a similar kick to playing international rugby.
The retired Ireland and Ulster winger (36) hung up his boots on his rugby career in 2018 to turn his attention to new challenges.
He has been co-presenting on Ireland AM for the past four months and said he's been busy "nerding-up" on his current affairs knowledge as a result.
Bowe, who's based in Belfast with wife Lucy and their children Emma (2) and 10-month-old Jamie, said many former players struggle to find a new career they feel passionate about.
"It's really something to run out in front of 80,000 people in Twickenham or the Aviva. You know you have all those eyeballs on you and you know it's live on television," he told the Herald.
"But I do still get the same kick and that little bit of adrenalin rush when I see the red light come on the camera first thing in the morning and you're waking everybody up and saying hello.
Kicks
"So whenever you retire from rugby it's very hard to find where you get your kicks from any more. Where do you get your adrenalin?
"So many guys I know who I played alongside, they're working in an office and they don't find the same enjoyment as playing rugby.
"It's hard to compete with running out in the Aviva, but I definitely think that live TV ticks a huge amount of those boxes. I know I'm so lucky."
Given that rugby players earn a fraction of the money that Premier League soccer players take home, continuing to work after they retire is essential, he said.
"If you're someone who's fully engrossed in the game of rugby and suddenly it stops, through injury, it is like you're dropped off the edge of a cliff.
"It is retirement in your 20s or early 30s and you have to get your head around that.
"You're at the top of your game and you can't do it any more and you now have to try and find a new career. Will you ever get to the level of the standard you were at?
"So it is really difficult. The majority of the guys have to go into business and go and work in a bank or an insurance company or sell medical devices. It is a real shock to the system."
He also admitted he's made plenty of bloopers since starting out, but said people seem to relate to him for that reason.
Relaxed
"I'm never going to be the most polished television presenter - that's just not the way I am," he said.
"I am a little bit more relaxed and I try to be myself."
Meanwhile, Virgin Media has unveiled its new spring schedule, with some major changes to its website.
Its player will feature plenty of free-to-air shows such as The Pembrokeshire Murders and the second series of The Bay as well as the new Love Island USA.
The Tonight Show, fronted by Matt Cooper and Ciara Doherty (pictured left), will go from three nights a week to four, while Ivan Yates has a new entertainment sports show starting this week.
For sports fans, Virgin Media has the rights to screen every game in the Six Nations, alongside the Champions Cup, the knock-out stages of the UEFA Champions League and the Europa League.
In March, Virgin Media is to screen the much-awaited Finding Jack Charlton, which was filmed during the last 18 months of the former Republic of Ireland manager's life. He passed away last July at the age of 85.

Trump becomes first US president to be impeached twice after Capitol attack

A majority of the US House of Representatives has voted to impeach US President Donald Trump for a second time.
The vote came just a week after he encouraged loyalists to "fight like hell" against election results in a speech that was followed by a mob of his supporters storming the US Capitol.
Mr Trump is the first American president to be impeached twice.
The House vote on an article of impeachment for "incitement of insurrection" is still under way.
During debate before the vote, House speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Republicans and Democrats to "search their souls".
Ms Pelosi called Mr Trump a "clear and present danger to the nation we all love".
Removal
Actual removal seems unlikely before the January 20 inauguration of Us president-elect Joe Biden.
A spokesman for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican leader would not agree to bring the chamber back immediately, all but ensuring a Senate trial could not begin at least until January 19.
But Mr McConnell did not rule out voting to convict Mr Trump in the event of a trial. In a note to his fellow Republican senators just before the House was to begin voting, he said he is undecided.
"While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate," Mr McConnell wrote.
While Mr Trump's first impeachment in 2019 brought no Republican votes in the House, several Republican leaders are breaking with the party to join Democrats this time, saying Mr Trump violated his oath to protect and defend US democracy.
However, most Republicans planned to vote "no" and representative Tom McClintock of California said during debate that impeaching Mr Trump a week before he leaves office is a "petty, vindictive and gratuitous act".
Crossed
As for threats of more trouble from intruders, security was exceptionally tight at the Capitol with shocking images of massed National Guard troops, secure perimeters around the complex and metal detector screenings required for representatives entering the House chamber.
Mr McConnell called major Republican donors last weekend to gauge their thinking about Mr Trump and was told that the president had clearly crossed a line.
The stunning collapse of Mr Trump's final days in office, along with warnings of more violence ahead, leaves the nation at an uneasy and unfamiliar juncture before Mr Biden takes office.
Mr Trump faces a single charge of "incitement of insurrection".
The four-page impeachment resolution relies on Mr Trump's own incendiary rhetoric and the falsehoods he spread about Mr Biden's election victory, including at a White House rally on the day of the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
Mr Trump took no responsibility for the riot, suggesting it was a drive to oust him rather than his actions around the bloody riot that was dividing the country.
"To continue on this path, I think it's causing tremendous danger to our country, and it's causing tremendous anger," Mr Trump said on Tuesday
A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot and killed a woman during the siege. Three other people died in what authorities said were medical emergencies.

Vincent's gives vaccine to non-frontline staff

St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin has admitted members of non-frontline staff have received the Covid-19 vaccine.
It comes amid reports that intensive care workers were among those who had to wait for the jab after a "glitch" in the booking system.
The situation has caused distress among frontliners who have been at patients' bedsides daily.
Priority
When asked on Monday if retired surgeons and private secretaries were given the vaccine above some nursing staff, a spokeswoman for the hospital said the priority list "follows national guidelines which is to provide the vaccine to groups of health care workers who are delivering direct patient care".
However, yesterday the spokeswoman acknowledged that "in certain instances non-frontline staff have received the vaccine to ensure that no vaccine is wasted". She said the earlier statement was "correct".
She added: "Our priority list has been in line with the guidelines to provide the vaccine to groups of health care workers who are delivering direct patient care.
"Following frontline staff, vaccination is provided to staff who in the course of their duties may be on wards or in direct contact with patients and staff, as well as other staff who in a surge may be redeployed to support frontline staff."

Vodafone's cut-price launch to kick-start mobile price war

A price war among Irish mobile networks is now in full effect after Vodafone launched a separate, cut-price mobile operator today.
Clear Mobile is to offer all calls, texts and 'unlimited' data for €12.99 per month without any contract. This is less than half the price of Vodafone's ordinary monthly tariffs for such features.
The move means ordinary mobile customers can now get all calls, texts and data for under €15 per month on each of the three major mobile networks, the first time this has happened.
Mobile call rates have fallen rapidly in recent years, from an average of around €40 to under €20.
An analysis of operators' mainstream plans compared to their budget ones show that customers who are still paying over €30 for monthly plans are losing out by at least €100 per year.
The Vodafone move is also a direct response to recent discount operator introductions from Eir and Three.
Eir's cut-price GoMo operator, which also charges €12.99 per month for calls, texts and 120GB of data without a contract, snatched over 150,000 customers in its first year, an event that saw Vodafone and Three lose around 1pc of their Irish market share.
Three, Ireland's second largest network, responded with a revamped cut-price deal through its discount brand 48, which currently offers all calls, texts and 100GB of data for €8 per month without a contract.
The Vodafone move could put further pressure on rivals such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, which charge from €20 per month, to reduce their pricing.
There is one catch to Clear Mobile that may limit its appeal to key youth markets.
Vodafone says it will limit the new service's speed to 5Mbs, effectively ruling out activities such as Netflix or Disney+ without the likelihood of buffering or freezing.
Expensive
The new discount operator's speed limit, which is a fraction of that offered on a normal 4G service, may reserve it for older people who simply want to use Google, email and a range of lighter activities.
The speed cap is to stop Vodafone customers leaving more expensive services, such as Vodafone X, which costs €20 per month and offers maximum speeds of 10Mbs.
Both GoMo and 48 have speeds up to 100Mbs on the 4G networks of their parent companies. An Post Mobile, which is the only other Irish operator to use Vodafone's network, offers speeds of up to 60Mbs for €15 per month.
As with other discount Irish operators, Clear Mobile will have its own website and customer service.
It will not offer subsidised phones or 'upgrades' and has a €12.99 'joining fee' in addition to a first month's payment.
"For Vodafone, in the context of Covid-19, it felt like the right time to provide more choice for consumers in this space," said a spokesperson.
"It's a simplified sim-only offering that suits the requirements of customers who want a paired back, low-cost option."
Aideen Chambers, Vodafone's head of consumer strategic products, has been appointed as Clear Mobile's general manager.

Ó Broin against social houses in his own area

Sinn Féin housing spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin opposed a social housing development in his own constituency after surveying local residents for their views on the project.
The 28-home development on public land was opposed by a majority of residents polled in Mr Ó Broin's Dublin mid-west constituency.
Sinn Féin councillors presented the survey results to South Dublin County Council and asked to move the 28-home development to another site.
They suggested building between 10 and 15 bungalows for elderly downsizers on the original site.
Strength
"Given the strength of local opposition to the proposed council development, Sinn Féin believes that the development should not proceed as proposed," the party said in a submission signed by Mr Ó Broin and his Dáil colleague Mark Ward.
Council managers agreed to reduce homes on the development to 19 units but said it could not change the site.
In December, Sinn Féin asked for a vote on the development to be delayed to allow councillors more time to consider the project.
At a meeting this week, the party put forward an amendment asking for the development to be reduced from 19 to 14 - but this was rejected.
Sinn Féin supported the final vote on the project after its motion was defeated.
"It's truly galling to see Eoin Ó Broin delaying housing in his own back yard," said deputy mayor of South County Dublin David McManus
Mr McManus said Sinn Féin's proposal would delay the project for at least another six months.
Mr Ó Broin said the Fine Gael councillor is "on a campaign to deliberately misrepresent" Sinn Féin's policy on housing.
"The councillor has no knowledge of what's in the best interest of locals in the area," he claimed.

'Forgotten county homes should be next' - Burton

The Government is expected to come under pressure today to commission an investigation into county homes.
Only four were within the scope of yesterday's report into mother and baby homes.
It noted: "Mother and baby homes were greatly superior to the county homes."
They were successors to the pre-Independence workhouses, and were owned and controlled by local authorities.
Conditions were generally "very poor" in the county homes where, until the 1960s, many unmarried mothers and their children were resident, the report said.
"Women in county homes have been largely forgotten," it stated.
Former Tánaiste Joan Burton said: "The county homes were obviously everywhere and are an absolute State responsibility, even if the local prelate or bishop called the shots.
"They were the former workhouses, were run by the local authorities and had an appalling death rate.
"I want an investigation into all county homes, some of which appear to have mass graves and burials in unconsecrated ground, sometimes farmers' fields."
The institutions, where around 25,000 were accommodated, admitted women with special needs, mental health problems, venereal disease or a criminal conviction.
They also took in children, sometimes with an intellectual disability or autism, who were given up by married families.
The care given to these children was "grossly inadequate", the report says and some of the descriptions given about the four sampled are "extremely distressing".
Beg
In the mid-1920s most had no sanitation, perhaps no running water, and heating by an open fire.
Unmarried mothers were allocated the worst accommodation because they were not seen as "deserving".
The diet was described as 'meagre'.
In the 1920s one medical officer had to beg for an improved diet to enable mothers to breastfeed their babies.

'Totally appropriate' - Trump refusing to take blame for rioting in DC

Donald Trump took no responsibility yesterday for instigating a violent insurrection at the US Capitol last week.
Despite encouraging supp- orters to march on the building and praising them while they were carrying out the assault, he said: "People thought that what I said was totally appropriate."
He made the comments during his first appearance in public since the siege, which came as lawmakers were tallying Electoral College votes affirming president-elect Joe Biden's victory.
Lynching
Trump was heading to Texas yesterday to campaign against illegal immigration as Congress appeared set to impeach him for the second time.
During the rampage through the halls of Congress, crowds called for vice president Mike Pence's lynching for his role in overseeing the vote count.
At least five people died, including a police officer.
In the days leading up to last Wednesday's certification vote, Trump encouraged his supp- orters to descend on Washington, promising a "wild" rally in support of his baseless claims of election fraud, despite his own administration's findings to the contrary.
Speaking for more than an hour to a crowd on the Ellipse, Trump encouraged supporters to "fight like hell" and suggested Republican lawmakers would need "more courage not to step up" and overturn the will of voters to grant him another term in office.
As Trump wrapped up, thousands of his supporters were already heading to the Capitol.
While the mob were still in the building and lawmakers sheltered in secure locations, Trump, at the urging of aides who were shocked by the violence, released a video seemingly excusing the events, saying of the rioters: "We love you. You're very special. Go home."
Speaking yesterday, he said the "real problem" was not his rhetoric, but the rhetoric that Democrats used to describe Black Lives Matter protests and violence in Seattle and Portland last summer.
Trump was headed to Alamo, near the US-Mexico border, the site of the 450th mile of the border wall his administration is building.
A few dozen Trump supporters rallied hours before his visit to the Rio Grande Valley near Harlingen airport, where he was scheduled to land.
They planned to stage a caravan of vehicles flying flags that support the president and far-right causes.
Four people interviewed yesterday morning all said they believed antifa and Black Lives Matter activists staged the Capitol riot, although federal authorities have uniformly identified far-right activists as responsible.
Two people said they still believed Trump would be inaugurated for a second term next week, even after Congress certified Biden's victory and courts at every level dismissed his baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.
"If he's able to see us, we hope it would encourage him and lift his spirits," said Sharon Katie Taylor, from Iowa."
Over the past four years, Trump and his administration have taken extreme and often unlawful action to try to curb illegal and legal immigration.
Reverse
Their efforts were aided in his final year by the coronavirus pandemic, which ground international travel to a halt.
However, the number of people stopped while trying to cross the southern border il- legally has been creeping back up in recent months.
Biden has said he will halt construction of the border wall and take executive action where possible to reverse some of Trump's restrictions on legal immigration and asylum-seekers.
However, the president-elect and his aides have acknowledged the possibility of a new crisis at the border if they act too quickly.

Donors dig deep so Larkin pupils get laptops for lessons at home

The head teacher of an inner-city Dublin school has said he is delighted after generous well-wishers donated 60 laptop computers so disadvantaged students can attend classes remotely during lockdown.
Sixty students at the Larkin Community College in Cathal Brugha Street will now be able to tune in along with their 340 classmates as online classes at the DEIS secondary school resume following the Christmas break.
It is all thanks to an initiative by college patron and Dublin businessman Paul Brereton, who put out an appeal on social media and through his own personal network.
Mr Brereton, president of the Irish Antique Dealers Association and boss of Core Bullion Traders, issued the call late last week on the Instagram account of the Vintage Hub, a page dedicated to vintage furniture dealers, and the response he got was overwhelming.
"I put up the alert at 9pm and it just went off. I'm in the thick of it. I've been at it since 4.30am," he said of ordering the Chrome Book laptops.
The donations came in thick and fast and by Sunday night, the target was reached.
College head teacher Thomas Usher said he is delighted with the response and hopes the initiative can be replicated in other schools where students come from disadvantaged backgrounds and cannot afford laptops.
"It's been amazing," he said of the response.
Mr Usher added that they got the first delivery of the devices on Monday and said they were to be delivered to pupils yesterday.
The donations will make a "significant difference" to the students, who had been either doing their remote learning via a smart phone or sharing a single computer with siblings or were simply not able to take part in online teaching.
"We did a survey of students and if they do have a device they're sharing it," Mr Usher said.
Many of the college's student population are from immigrant backgrounds.
Some are living in emergency accommodation in the area due to the ongoing homelessness crisis or come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
Despite this, the school has a 93pc progression rate for graduates to go on to third-level education, "which is phenomenal for a DEIS inner city school", Mr Usher said.
Struggling
The laptops will make a huge difference for the parents of students who are struggling to make ends meet.
"The value of education is high, especially for new Irish who will go into debt to pay for their children's education," Mr Usher said.
"At a time when all we're hearing is bad news, this has really turned it on its head."
Father-of-three Mr Brereton has been a patron of the school for the past three years after he got involved in a fundraiser for his children's school in Clontarf and realised how the need for funds was much greater in less well-off neighbourhoods.
He approached Mr Usher and has been offering his support ever since.
"I just wanted to help out," he said."These kids need to have the top equipment so they can have a chance."
However, he said it is the donors who are the real heroes.
"I just directed traffic a bit. This really strikes a chord with everyone," Mr Brereton said, adding that one donor is based in Cork.
"Education is the most important thing you can give to someone."
Mr Usher and Mr Brereton hope they can keep the momentum going and would be delighted if other schools got involved.

Drug giant looks for EU nod on its vaccine

Drug giant AstraZeneca has submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to license its Covid-19 vaccine, which was co-developed with Oxford University.
The EU regulator said it had received a request for the approval to be expedited and it could be confirmed by January 29 "provided the data submitted on the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine are sufficiently robust and complete".
The EMA, the drug agency for the 27-nation EU, has already approved two other coronavirus vaccines: one made by American company Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech, and another made by US biotechnology company Moderna.
Switzerland approved the Moderna vaccine yesterday.
Britain gave its approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in December, while India approved it this month.
As part of its strategy to obtain as many different Covid-19 vaccines as possible for Europeans, the EU said it had concluded early talks with French biotech company Valneva to secure up to 60 million doses of vaccine.
Error
Valneva previously signed a deal with Britain to provide tens of millions of doses.
The EU has sealed six vaccine contracts for up to two billion doses.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be a key vaccine for many countries because of its low cost, availability and ease of use. It can be kept in refrigerators.
The company has said it will sell it for $2.50 (€2) a dose.
Researchers claim the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine protected against disease in 62pc of those given two full doses and in 90pc of those initially given a half dose because of a manufacturing error.
However, the second group included only 2,741 people - too few to be conclusive.
Questions also remain about how the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Freeze causes burst pipes all over capital

Water supplies in the Greater Dublin Area are under strain following a spate of burst pipes caused by the recent freezing temperatures.
Irish Water has appealed to householders and business owners in the region to check for leaks on their properties and is urging people to conserve water.
The utility was responding to 50 burst water mains around the country yesterday, following on from dozens of similar incidents since the start of this week.
Investigations into leaks suspected to be caused by burst mains were also taking place at dozens of other locations.
Strains
Thousands of homes and premises have suffered outages, although supply strain is so far only a concern in the Greater Dublin Area.
Demand for water was already at an all-time high for the winter in the region before Christmas, but pressure on the supply has increased further in recent days in what is a familiar fallout from periods of sub-zero temperatures.
Freezing water expands and strains the pipes until they rupture.
The problem is most severe in older, weakened pipes but modern pipes can burst, particularly where they are laid in shallow ground.
The closure of business premises because of Covid-19 restrictions has also left many buildings unheated for prolonged periods, which is adding to the problem.
Tom Cuddy, Irish Water's head of operations, said all known leaks were being fixed but he asked the public to identify trouble spots.
"We are appealing to homes, businesses and those responsible for unoccupied buildings to check for leaks, whilst adhering to current public health regulations and advice, and to turn off water where it's not needed," he said.

GPs angry at the lack of promised Covid jab booking system

A row has broken out over delays in offering the Covid-19 vaccine to GPs who are in the frontline of patient care as thousands of people test positive for the virus.
Worried GPs have warned they have been overlooked for access to the Covid-19 vaccine despite being at risk of contracting the virus.
It comes as a key tool in the HSE's Covid-19 vaccine plan has suffered a setback after a new online system to allow GPs to register to get the jab for themselves failed to get up and running yesterday.
Members of the public will be asked to use the same portal in a number of months when there is more vaccines for the wider population.
The plan was to launch the portal first for GPs most of whom are still without the first dose of the vaccine despite working in the frontline.
However, the failure of the portal to materialise has left family doctors angry and frustrated.
Drogheda GP Dr Ruairi Hanley said: "GPs and practice nurses must be immunised as soon as possible.
Millions
"This is not just for their sake and the sake of their patients but also because in a matter of weeks the AstraZeneca vaccine will arrive and GPs will be expected to immunise millions of people.
"How can they do that if many of them become infected?
The first people you should vaccinate are the vaccinators.
"It is a basic principle that the HSE is apparently struggling to grasp."
"Some GPs have managed to get vaccinated thanks to the generosity of local hospitals on an ad hoc basis.
"Basically they had some spare vaccines.
"Local GPs took some initiative and they got sorted out. Well done to all involved."
But while most welcome it, this spontaneous, haphazard approach is clearly not a coordinated plan.
"Other GPs in other parts of the country are still waiting for clarity as are their nurses.
"All hospitals should immediately be given the necessary supplies to vaccinate all GPs and their nurses in their respective areas as a matter of urgency."
There is also frustration at claims that some HSE backroom staff and retired doctors have received the vaccine in advance of frontline health workers.
Asked if backroom health staff and retired medics were vaccinated before frontline workers the HSE said it has no specific accounts of deviation from a reasonable approach to prioritisation.
But if any specific incidents of inappropriate prioritisation for vaccine are identified this will be addressed.
"The HSE is considering developing principles to guide prioritisation for the healthcare worker vaccination programmes," said a spokeswoman.
"These principles will form the basis for detailed guidance.
Exposure
"Broadly speaking the principles will be that priority is based on the exposure risk in the context of the work done by the healthcare worker and will not be based on grade or work location."

Grim January - 46 deaths and wards under serious strain

Fears are growing that  January will bring a grim death toll from coronavirus as 46 Covid-19 related fatalities were reported yesterday while hospitals struggled with a rising tide of patients struck by the disease.
Hospitals are having to convert more wards to provide temporary intensive-care beds as Covid-19 admissions reached another milestone of 1,692.
The number of patients in intensive care rose to 158, surpassing the peak of 155 in spring.
It comes as the number of people newly diagnosed with the virus fell to 3,098, sparking hopes that the surge is levelling off at last and that lockdown measures are having an impact.
All but two of the Covid-19 related deaths occurred in January with the others happening in December, highlighting the deadly impact the virus is having once again, predominantly in older age groups.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: "Unfortunately we are seeing the effect of the recent surge of infections reflected in the increased mortality we are reporting.
"Unfortunately, due to the unsustainably high level of Covid-19 infection we have experienced as a country over the past few weeks, sadly these figures are likely to continue for the next period of time.
"What we can do today, out of respect for those who have lost their lives and those currently in hospital or ICU - and those caring for them - is to hold firm and stay home."
Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn pointed out that "at least one in three patients admitted to hospital or critical care in January have been under the age of 65 years.
"This clearly demonstrates that Covid-19 affects us all, regardless of age or underlying condition.
"It highlights the need for us all to protect one another by staying at home.
"Not only will you keep yourself and your loved ones safe, but also help avoid more preventable Covid-19 admissions to our currently struggling healthcare system."
Of the new cases reported yesterday, 604 were in Galway, 574 in Dublin, 466 in Mayo, 187 in Cork and 138 in Limerick.
Dr Brian Kinirons, consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care at University Hospital Galway said: "We are seeing a diverse group in intensive care.
"Certainly there are younger patients. Initially many of our patients would be in their 60s, 70s or older. We have patients in their 80s.
"But we have patients who are a lot younger and in their 50s. The message is that youth does not necessarily protect you."
He said the more underlying illnesses a patient has the greater their risk of mortality.
"We are seeing a change in the profile of the patients and the transmissability of the virus is remarkable this time."
He said the hospital has effectively had to be given over to the medical care of Covid-19 patients.
"Six wards are now dedicated to Covid-19 patients," he added, paying tribute to his colleagues for their dedication.
The forecast is that there could be between 2,000 to 2,500 Covid-19 patients in hospital nationally in up to two weeks' time and 200 to 400 patients needing intensive care.
Hoping
Meanwhile, new figures show how congregated settings like nursing homes are bearing the brunt again of the surge in the virus.
There were 52 outbreaks in nursing homes last week, up from 30 the previous week.
Figures show 49 outbreaks in residential institutions, an increase of 39 from the previous week.
Many nursing homes are hoping vaccines will come in time before another dangerous spread.
It comes as six residents at Droimnín Nursing Home in Stradbally, Co Laois, died in the past week after contracting Covid-19, just days before they were due to receive their first dose of the vaccine.
The outbreak led to 52 of the 65 residents testing positive for the virus, with 33 of the 75 staff also contracting the disease.
The first doses of vaccine were due to be given to residents of Droimnín on January 19 but this has had to be postponed as a protective measure, given the latest surge in Covid cases.

Mother of autistic children takes on teacher roles as Covid halts special needs supports

A law student who is homeschooling three of her children who have autism says she now has to carry out seven roles because supports have been taken away due to Covid restrictions.
Carol Lennon says as well as being a carer for her children, she is now a physiotherapist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, counsellor, psychologist and, since Monday, a teacher.
She said she is studying human rights while her children have been robbed of theirs in education.
On Monday, the mother of five began homeschooling Junior Certificate pupil Tiegan, Leaving Certificate student Logan and 13-year-old Xylan at her home in Mornington, Co Meath.
To keep the teenagers motivated in free periods, she has designed visual instructions to teach them how to use the washing machine, tumble dryer and dishwasher.
"If I don't keep the kids motivated, they'll disappear back to their rooms and it will be a nightmare to get them back down," she said.
"So far Xylan is loving it - you should see the amount of washing he is getting through.
"Homeschooling is hard for parents anyway but when you have three children with autism there is the added meltdowns, anxiety and everything else to deal with.
"You always have to be one step ahead to be able to anticipate any problems that might crop up.
"I'm timetabled to teach from 8.30am to 3.30pm with a short break, while trying to get my study done for an exam in a few weeks."
Ms Lennon's eldest child Tristan (18) was recently offered a place in a UCD genetics course after she fought to get the additional resources he needed in school to have the same chance as any other pupil.
"These are the additional supports that my children normally get which have been stopped temporarily because of Covid," she said.
"I am now following the schedules of teachers whose main focus is my child and their educational development.
"These teachers will not know the dynamics in my household nor could I expect them to.
"I am one person.
"If my home was a school setting, it would be receiving financial resources for the printer and heating and a staff of one qualified teacher and two special needs assistants as well as other supports."

Potter star Jessie tells of baby's 'scary' Covid run-in

Jessie Cave, who played Lavender Brown in the Harry Potter films, has said it was a "scary start" for her newborn baby after he tested positive for coronavirus.
The actress (33) welcomed Tenn in October after a "traumatic" delivery that left him in the neonatal unit.
She said the baby is out of hospital and is doing well, but her partner now has Covid and the stress has caused her breast milk to dry up.
"Nothing has gone to plan, which I guess everyone can relate to this year. It was a really scary start," Cave told ITV's Lorraine.
"He was in the neonatal unit after a really sudden, quick labour.
"He came out within 45 minutes, so he was just a bit like, 'What's going on?', and was taken to the neonatal unit. He's 11 weeks now.
"It's been such a strange period of time for everyone, but very scary."
Discussing how Tenn may have contracted the virus, Cave said: "All I know is it's absolutely the most contagious thing.
"I was completely symptomless, so it's just bizarre.
"And he was completely fine. There was absolutely nothing wrong.
"Then over a week, almost two weeks later, he just suddenly turned.
Crying
"Within a day of realising he was just kind of changing a bit, he wasn't feeding as much and his crying was different, it was like a different baby.
"I just went for it and I went into A&E. I think that's what everyone has to do.
"They have to be aware of a sudden quick change, because it could have been a completely different story if I hadn't gone in.
"You really do have to be so quick to go in and don't be scared of going in. Just don't wait, go."
Cave and her partner, the comedian Alfie Brown, are also parents to Donnie (5) and Margot (3).
Brown now has the virus.
"It's such a strange illness and it affects everyone completely differently, and so it's completely affected our lives over this period of time," Cave said.
"He's OK, he's doing much better now.
"It's just bizarre how it didn't affect me and it's completely affected him.
"We know people who have had to go to hospital.
"Everyone has said to me, 'I didn't think babies can get it', but it can affect everyone.
"Because of the stress, my milk dried up a little bit and now I've had to give him formula."

Jess Redden and her fiancé Rob Kearney are extremely glad to be free after a two-week quarantine in a hotel room in Australia.
The couple, who got engaged in December 2019, recently moved to Perth due to Rob signing with the Australian rugby union side Western Force.
In Australia, anyone arriving into the country or travelling from certain Australian states have to quarantine for 14-days in a hotel chosen by the government, which they also have to pay for.
The couple could not even open the window in their hotel room while quarantining, Jess revealed.
"We were assigned a hotel in the airport so only found out once we landed. I cannot wait to breathe fresh air again in 13 days' time," Ms Redden said.
Jess, a 27-year-old fitness model and student pharmacist, documented the couple's struggle to stay active in a hotel room in Brisbane as they completed their 14-day quarantine.
"2 weeks with no air and I cannot convey the gratitude I have for the sun on my skin this morning," Jess said.

Joan Collins has said getting the Covid-19 jab was the "easiest thing" as she revealed she has "worn out the carpet" by keeping fit during lockdown.
The former Dynasty star (87) received the "painless" vaccination on Saturday.
"I really wanted to get it. I just wanted to tell anybody who's worried about it, there's nothing to worry about. It was the easiest thing," she told Good Morning Britain.
"It was just like a little scratch, there was no pain. I had no after-effects. I went home and had a drink.
"If you're advised by your GP to go, please go."
Collins said she "rushed" to get the vaccine after getting the call.
She told the show she found lockdown "pretty difficult" before channel- ling "how I was as a little tiny girl, during the war".
Painting
"We didn't have a television and we didn't have a lot of things, but I did a lot of reading, writing, painting, drawing," she said.
"I did a lot of things with my hands, and this is what I'm starting to do."
The actress has taken a novel approach to exer- cising.
"I don't like going for long walks when it's 3C," she said, "so I've been walking around our flat. I've worn out the carpet."
Asked if getting the jab was the best thing she has done since appearing in The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas, she said: "I would say it beats it hands down."

'Go as soon as possible' - Pressure grows on Pence to push Trump from office

As Impeachment pressure mounts, the US House of Representatives worked swiftly yesterday to try to oust President Donald Trump from office, pushing the vice president and Cabinet to act first.
Trump faces a single charge - "incitement of insurrection" - in an impeachment resolution that could go to a vote by mid-week.
First, Democrats called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke constitutional authority under the 25th Amendment to remove Mr Trump from office before January 20, when Democrat Joe Biden is to be  inaugurated.
In all, these are stunning final moments for Mr Trump's presidency as Democrats and a growing number of Republicans declare that he is unfit for office and could do more damage after inciting a mob that ransacked the US Capitol in a deadly siege on Wednesday.
"President Trump gravely endangered the security of the US and its institutions of government," reads the four-page impeachment bill.
"He will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office," it reads.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is recalling lawmakers to Washington for votes as more Republicans say it's time for Mr Trump to resign.
Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Mr Trump to "go away as soon as  possible."
During an interview on 60 Minutes aired Sunday, Ms Pelosi invoked the Watergate era when Republicans in the Senate told president Richard Nixon: "It's over."
"That's what has to happen now," she said.
Yesterday, a House resolution calling on Mr Pence to invoke constitutional authority to remove Mr Trump from office was blocked by  Republicans.
However, the full House is set to hold a roll call vote on that resolution today, and it is expected to pass.
After that, Ms Pelosi said Mr Pence will have 24 hours to respond.
Next, the House would proceed to impeachment. A vote could come tomorrow.
Mr Pence has given no  indication he is ready to proceed on such a course.
The impeachment bill from Representatives David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Jerrold Nadler of New York draws from Mr Trump's own false statements about his election defeat to Mr Biden.
Judges across the country, including some nominated by Mr Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases, and Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud.
The bill of impeachment details Mr Trump's pressure on state officials in Georgia to "find" him more votes and his White House rally ahead of the Capitol siege, in which he encouraged thousands of supporters to "fight like hell" and march to the building.
The mob overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalising Mr Biden's victory over Mr Trump in the Electoral College.
Horror
"We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent threat," Ms Pelosi said in a letter late Sunday to colleagues.
"The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action."
Mr Toomey said he doubted impeachment could be done before the inauguration, even though a growing number of lawmakers say that step is necessary to ensure Mr Trump can never hold elected office again.
"I think the president has disqualified himself from ever, certainly, serving in office again," Mr Toomey said. "I don't think he is electable in any way."

70pc of homes 'too big for occupants' needs'

Almost seven in 10 people in Ireland are living in homes that are too large for their household needs.
New figures published by the European Commission show that Ireland has one of the highest rates of people living in under-occupied dwellings in the EU.
Official statistics released by Eurostat reveal that 69.6pc of Irish people were living in dwellings deemed too large for their needs in 2019 in terms of excess rooms - more than twice the EU average of 32.7pc.
Older
Only Malta and Cyprus had higher rates of under-occupied homes than Ireland.
"The classic cause of under-occupation is older individuals or couples remaining in their home after their children have grown up and left, while family breakdown can also result in under-occupation," a Eurostat spokesperson said.
On average, there are 2.1 rooms per person in Irish households compared to the EU average of 1.6 rooms.
The Republic's high rate is believed to be linked to the large number of adults living in "empty nest" households and the relatively larger size of traditional Irish families and the associated need for more bedrooms compared to most other European countries.
The latest figures show that over 92pc of older people in Ireland are living in homes that are considered too big for their actual needs.
In contrast, only 3.2pc of the Irish population were classified as living in overcrowded households in 2019, although the figure has increased from 2.7pc the previous year.
It is still the second lowest rate among the EU's 27 member states where 17.2pc of people on average live in households without enough rooms for their needs.
However, the proportion of people on low incomes and at risk of poverty who live in overcrowded conditions in Ireland is almost twice the national average at 5.9p.
Irish males (3.5pc) are also more likely than Irish females (3.0pc) to live in overcrowded households.
Based on age, 20 to 25-year- olds are most likely to be living in an overcrowded dwelling with the problem affecting 5.8pc of that age group compared to just 0.3pc of those aged over 65 years.
Overcrowded accommodation is considered to be any dwelling that does not have the number of rooms appropriate to the size of the household, the family situation and the ages of its members.
It is calculated on the basis of there being one living room, one room per couple, one room for each single adult, one room per pair of single people of the same gender aged 12-17 and one room per pair of children under 12.
Under-occupied homes are households with more than the minimum number of rooms considered adequate.
The European Commission expressed concern about the impact of living in overcrowded living conditions during the current pandemic where many people are confined to their homes due to public health guidelines and regulations.
Telework
"Overcrowded households can feel even smaller with kids playing in the same room as parents trying to telework during the coronavirus lockdown," a spokesperson said.
"Moreover, overcrowded environments can present a higher risk of spreading the virus."
On measures of housing quality, Irish homes were slightly better than the EU average with 12.5pc of Irish people living in a house with a leaking roof and 4.9pc unable to keep their home adequately warm.

Buses and cycle route plan for Phoenix Park

The introduction of a bus service, a near doubling of cycle routes, a 30km speed limit and the gradual deterrence of private cars are among plans to overhaul access to and transport in Phoenix Park.
No permanent entrance closures are proposed, but one, the Cabra Gate, is to be for buses, cyclists and walkers only.
Ashtown Gate will be entry-only and Knockmaroon Gate would lead to a cul-de-sac.
Several other culs-de-sac would be created to allow motorists to reach amenities but deter through traffic.
Priority
Buses would serve key attractions, including Dublin Zoo and Phoenix Park Visitor Centre, and provide commuter services for the 2,800 people who work in the park.
There will also be links to other services in the north of the city as well as to Heuston and Broombridge rail stations and the Luas Green Line.
Chesterfield Avenue would still be open to traffic but with extra cycle lanes and bus priority at junctions.
A total of 3km of internal roads would be traffic-free, while 13.5km would see re- duced traffic.
An extra 14km of cycling routes would be provided and the 17km of existing cycle lanes would be upgraded.
Upgrades for 7.2km of existing walking routes would be carried out and pedestrian crossings would be installed throughout the park.
The plans are contained in a study drawn up by the Office of Public Works (OPW), National Transport Authority, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.
Minister Patrick O'Donovan ordered the study after a temporary ban on cars in the park during the first Covid-19 restrictions prompted calls for a permanent prohibition.
A phased introduction of the changes is advised, beginning within months with an interim bus service and the piloting of culs-de-sac at North Road, Upper Glen Road and the Upper Glen Road car park.
Other changes would be rolled out over five years, with a review of the strategy to take place at the end of that period.

Dub wins marathon test of endurance to spread word of girl's battle with epilepsy

A Dublin man has run daily marathons for 66 days to raise awareness about a young girl with severe epilepsy.
Mark Conlon (37), of Clondalkin, has won the Last Person Standing competition organised by East of Ireland Marathons, which tested runners to the limits of their endurance.
He said he hoped that by winning the competition he would be able to draw attention to the struggles of Freya Doyle (10), who has a severe form of epilepsy known as Ohtahara syndrome and cannot walk, talk or feed herself.
"I ran the event for a beautiful little princess, Freya Doyle. She suffers with a very rare form of epilepsy - there are only four of Freya's kind in Ireland," he said.
"She was only given until the age of one to live - she is an extremely brave little girl and a battler.
"When it ramped up and we were doing 30 to 35km a day, there were only four men left. By December, there were only two of us.
"They put up the distance of the marathon more every day. It was extremely tough. Going out in all weather conditions - rain, frost. Running for 10 hours a day in the wet and cold.
"By the end of December, we were doing ultra-marathons every day.
"On December 30, I was doing my second 75km in a row and I got the call I had been waiting for."
His fellow competitor had dropped out, but Mark still had to finish the marathon to win. He said it was the thought of Freya that kept him going.
"I had 35km to go. It took me 12 hours to finish the last distance and I was champion," he said.
Freya's dad, Greg, said the family are fundraising to adapt their home to make it more accessible for Freya.
"We never really thought that we'd be coming to this and that she'd be getting this big," he said.
Difficult
"At the moment, every night we're having to lift her up and down the stairs.
"My wife has bad back problems. I could be working late and Freya would have to be sleeping on the floor downstairs until I get home, and then I would have to lift her up.
"We only have one income coming in - my wife is a full-time carer, and it was always difficult because we could only have one job between the two of us.
"That's why we feel we have to fundraise."
The couple are hoping to raise €40,000 to make their home more accessible and have already raised €22,000 on their GoFundMe page.

Gardaí can now hand out on-the-spot fines of €100 to people who are found travelling beyond the 5km Covid travel limit and refuse to turn back.
Gardaí can prosecute breaches of travel restrictions introduced during Level 5 with a fixed charge notice.
Garda Headquarters yesterday announced that a person who breaches travel regulations, and fails to comply with an officer's directions, can be prosecuted.
This includes an on-the-spot fine of €100 but in other cases directions may be taken from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
Gardaí have escalated their policing response after beauty spots across the country were packed over the weekend with visitors outside their 5km limit.
The fixed-charge notices can be now be handed out under emergency health legislation measures which state that a person shall not leave their place of residence 'without reasonable excuse'.
Gardaí say they are continuing to police by consent and enforcement is a last resort.
Assistant Commissioner John Twomey, who oversees the force's Policing and Security, said: "An Garda Síochána continues to see significant compliance by the public with Public Health Regulations, however we also continue to see some activity which is in contravention of these regulations introduced to stop the current spread of Covid-19 and protect our communities.
"I appeal to every person without a reasonable excuse for travel - stay at home. This is your duty as a citizen and will save lives and support our frontline services, nurses, doctors, hospital staff and my Garda colleagues at this time," he added.
Travelling beyond the 5km is permitted in certain instances, including work-related travel for essential services, medical appointments and visiting a person within your bubble.
Excuse
Gardaí have also repeatedly emphasised that the 5km limit does not apply to victims of domestic violence who are seeking help.
A number of people have already been prosecuted for breaching Covid-19 travel restrictions.
In Leitrim, a man was jailed for two months for breaching lockdown travel restrictions without a reasonable excuse.
A man in Dublin was jailed for 30 days for the same offence, while in Tipperary a man was given a €400 fine. Other prosecutions in Sligo, Kildare and Cavan have resulted in fines ranging between €150 and €300.

Heat is on United to prove they are contenders

Manchester United get the chance to leap above Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table tonight and we are about to find out whether they can handle the pressure of challenging for the title.
For the last couple of seasons, Liverpool have been the team to beat and the pressure that goes with everyone shooting at you needed to be absorbed by Jurgen Klopp and his players.
To their credit, Liverpool have handled that status superbly well and despite everything that has been thrown at them this season, with injuries and dodgy VAR decisions, they managed to keep their momentum going up to their last three games.
Yet, after draws against West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle were followed by a 1-0 defeat at Southampton last week, the mood has changed around Liverpool and there is no doubt that this is their biggest hiccup in a couple of years.
They have set their standards so high and have won games at a rate we have rarely seen in the history of the English game, but something is lacking at Liverpool right now and the opposition is sensing that this is their moment to pounce.
I still believe Manchester City are the chief threat to Liverpool in this season's title race, as they are a team that can go on a winning run and pull clear at the top, but United get their chance to confirm they are genuine title contenders when they take on Burnley tonight.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is defying plenty of doubters by pushing United into a decent position in the table, but the mindset will switch if they get the win this evening and take over the lead in the Premier League.
If they come to Anfield next Sunday with a three-point lead over Liverpool, all the pressure will be on Solskjaer and his players to live up to their status as league leaders.
How will they cope with that? The truth is we don't know and they don't know either.
This United side has never been a position at the mid-way point of the season when they have been sitting at the top and everyone is trying to shoot them down.
United have some great attacking players in their side, with Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford two top-class performers who can take the game away from any team on their day.
Yet I look across their team and they have weak spots in several areas, with Manchester City's comprehensive win against them in the Carabao Cup semi-final at Old Trafford last week highlighting United's soft spots at the highest level.
I don't think their defence is good enough to win the Premier League title and I don't like the look of parts of their midfield either.
But this is not a season to make too many bold projections, as logic went out the window a long time ago.
Whether it is the absence of fans or the Covid madness that is going on all around us, you just don't know what you are going to get from week to week with a lot of teams, including United and Liverpool.
How can a United side that was hammered 6-1 by Tottenham at Old Trafford earlier this season find themselves in a position to go top of the table tonight?
It makes no sense, but nothing makes sense in this world right now and it means we could end up getting a surprising result in the Premier League title race this time.
With the points total required to win the league dropped from the high 90s to less than 85 this season, it brings teams like United and Tottenham into the mix as they could conceivably reach that kind of total.
I'd be surprised if either of those two ends up as champions. We can all see issues in their teams, with one of United's big problems on their touchline as I'm still not convinced Solskjaer is a manager capable of winning big trophies for them.
Yet they could be six points clear of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League by the time I write my column for The Herald next week and if that happens, they would have to be taken seriously as title challengers.
Manchester City will play one of their games in hand against Brighton tomorrow night and I'd expect them to win that pretty comfortably, so things are about to get very interesting at the top of the table.
Maybe this is precisely the kind of competition Liverpool need to get them back up to full speed because Klopp's side has underperformed in their last three Premier League matches.
The champions appeared to have been lacking a bit of drive in their last few games, after winning so much over the last couple of years.
So the challenge being thrown down by Manchester's top two clubs will fire Klopp's side as we head into the second half of the most unpredictable season we have seen in years.

Phillip Schofield has praised Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes after he spoke about his sexuality on one of their editions of This Morning.
The TV star appeared on a programme they were hosting last year, soon after he had revealed on Instagram that he had "been coming to terms with the fact that I am gay".
"I said to Holly 'It has to be on This Morning - I owe it to our viewers because you know it is all a family, they have to be the first to hear'," he told the Life, Interrupted podcast.
"Eamonn and Ruth were brought into the conversation much later but they were as obviously as gracious as you would expect them to be that I needed to nick 10 minutes of their show.
"And so that was it, that was decided," he said.
Schofield added: "The date was decided because we didn't want it to be too close to the NTAs (National Television Awards).
"We didn't want to look like it was a publicity thing.
"And then I can remember saying 'This is ridiculous ... this is the biggest thing I'm ever going to do in my life. How is this a publicity stunt? For what?'"
Difficult
He said of Willoughby: "There's no way it would have been anyone else.
"There's not a single person on this planet that I would have done that with other than Holly, it was only going to be her.
"And she was unbelievable. When you're sitting opposite a mate who is doing this - It's a fine line.
"She had to ask the right questions she had. She couldn't give me an easy ride, it had to be tough questions.
"But at the same time making sure that I was OK because she knew that I wasn't. It was tough.
"That was a very difficult gig for her."
He said of This Morning: "The innuendos are shocking really, but we never get into trouble, which is lovely.
"I think both Holly and I know where the line is - we've almost had two feet over the line but not quite."
Holmes and Langsford recently left the Friday show in a shake-up, with Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond taking their place.
The married couple will continue to host the daytime show "during key holidays".
The Life, Interrupted podcast is presented by TV star Simon Thomas "and tackles how crisis and desperation can, over time, lead to hope and inspiration".

There are very few people alive today who lived through the Spanish Flu pandemic from 1918 to 1920, and fewer again who caught the killer flu but lived to tell the tale.
Michael J O'Connor, of Muckross, Co Kerry, can boast both accomplishments.
At 107, Mr O'Connor is one of the oldest people in Ireland and caught the Spanish Flu as a child.
Doctors had expected him to die before the age of six but he survived and lived a long and happy life.
Tragically, Mr O'Connor's mother died after catching the virus.
"Everything was going well until misfortune hit the family and we saw poor days," he told Brian O'Connell on Today with Claire Byrne on RTÉ Radio One.
"We had no particular name for it, it was just the flu." he said.
"I got it, unfortunately mam didn't survive it but I got out of it all right, even though I wasn't expected to do so.
"As a young lad, I could see them crying after me as I was dying."
He discussed the similarities between the coronavirus pandemic and the 1918 influenza pandemic, pointing out that "some got it and some didn't".
Difficult
"Those that got it got a bad dose of it and didn't survive and some did," he said.
"There are always difficult times. There was never a time that wasn't difficult for somebody or for groups of people but we never experienced a worldwide difficulty like we are now.
"Every country and every body is affected."
Viruses are not the only danger Mr O'Connor has encountered in his life, having worked as a radio operator on a boat that was torpedoed in World War II.
"We were torpedoed on August 18, 1942. A torpedo explodes underneath you and we were fairly well lifted out of it," he said.
Mr O'Connor said it had been a terrible experience but that the ship didn't lose anybody on that day, luckily.
He retired in 1980 after a long career in aviation and nowadays jokes that he has more years in retirement than years worked at this stage.
His nightcap is a mixture of whiskey and milk and he said the secret to a long life is "honesty - be honest in your dealings with everybody, be at peace with yourself and try and avoid doing wrong to anybody".
Mr O'Connor's full interview on Today with Claire Byrne can be found on the RTÉ website.

An Post has warned anyone who is waiting for inter-national mail that Covid-19 restrictions will probably mean further delays in the coming weeks.
A spokesperson said international and local Covid restrictions coupled with "limited space for letters and parcels" on far fewer inter- national flights continues to severely affect delivery services.
"As a result, many items posted in Ireland during December for delivery across the world are still in transit," the spokesperson said.
Severe weather conditions in different regions are also affecting services worldwide, An Post added.
The company said it will still be delivering parcels and cards that were sent before Christmas until the end of this month.
Assured
"An Post expects to be receiving incoming inter- national Christmas parcels and letters for delivery in Ireland throughout January," the spokesperson added.
The company assured Irish customers it will deliver all items as soon as they are in Ireland.

Rebekah Vardy has revealed she injured her professional partner so badly during Dancing On Ice rehearsals that he had to go to hospital.
Vardy, who is married to Leicester City's Jamie Vardy, is teamed with Andy Buchanan for the ITV show.
She said: "I seem to be the only one who's ended up hurting my pro, putting him in hospital.
"I do apologise. No, it was awful; I think I've just come to terms with scarring his face."
Sliced
She added: "We were practising a trick and we changed it slightly from something that we would normally do - and we did it on a daily basis and everything would go right.
"On this occasion, it went very wrong and the back of my heel and my blade sliced his face open.
"He was fine. All he was concerned about was making sure that he could skate the next day, where I was not interested in that in the slightest, I just wanted to make sure that he was OK.
"It was quite scary. But it brings back the realisation that what we're doing is really bloody dangerous, but he's fine."
Vardy has also appeared on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! but said braving the ice was far more terrifying.

'Government will promise us the world but I'm sceptical'

The final report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission is set to be published tomorrow and historian Catherine Corless has said that while the Government will "promise the world and all", she remains unconvinced about its commitment to survivors.
"I'm a bit sceptical still. I have reason to be with the way the various governments have treated the matter right from the start," she said.
"I couldn't ever sit back and say, 'this is it'."
Long-awaited and put back a number of times, the commission's 4,000-page report is due to be presented to Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman.
Following a Cabinet meeting tomorrow, the minister, together with the Taoiseach, will discuss the contents with survivors via a web seminar before it is then widely released.
The report will detail key issues such as the treatment of women and children in the homes, the prevalence of abuse, forced adoptions and forced participation in vaccine trials, burial practices, as well as the provision of bodies for medical research.
The commission was set up more than five years ago in the wake of claims by Ms Corless that up to 800 babies were interred in an unmarked mass grave at a former Bon Secours home in Tuam, Co Galway.
But the campaigner claimed that even when it was proved in 2017 that the bodies of the babies in Tuam existed, "everyone sat back again" and did nothing.
"I have to watch and be alert because that's the pressure that's needed to keep this story out there," Ms Corless said, adding that it took "a fair bit of pressure" and "trying to connect with ministers" to keep the focus on the matter.
Asked if she ever felt personally attacked by those who tried to cast doubt on her claims about the Tuam site, she said it would "niggle (her) a bit".
"But I had the evidence there in my hand and this is the prime evidence," she added.
"I never said anything I couldn't back up. I knew what I was talking about. So at the end of the day, it didn't matter."
Ms Corless said the publication of the commission's final report is merely "the opening of a door" and not the end.
"There will be a lot of fuss on the day, but what is coming after that - will there be apologies?" she asked.
Survivors are concerned about health packages and proper professional counselling services, she said.
"They need a continuous health package. They're fed up to the teeth," she said.
Dignified
Meanwhile she said it is "very upsetting" that nothing has been done as yet at the Tuam site to exhume and reinter the bodies of the babies in a dignified manner.
"They're still down there. There isn't even a plan there - the site was put back exactly as it was," she said.
She warned Tuam may be the tip of the iceberg because they "copied each other with protocol".
She hopes the commission might have obtained more information on this.
"I hope it's in the report. What's the point of it otherwise? I hope there's a lot more evidence of what we're suspecting," she said.

The family of George Nkencho, the man shot dead by armed gardaí, have described life as a "gift" and urged people "not to waste it".
A memorial for the 27-year-old, who died on December 30, was held near Mr Nkencho's home in west Dublin yesterday.
There were emotional scenes as family and friends gathered to remember him and release balloons in the colours of his favourite team, Manchester United.
A minute's silence was held after speeches were made and his name was read out 21 times.
Mr Nkencho was described as a "beautiful guy" and a "great friend, brother and son".
Challenges
His sister Gloria Nkencho said: "The one thing that I've realised in all of this is life is a gift.
"Every day we stand here it's a gift. It is a gift to be breathing.
"We're here to think about George and as we release these balloons I want everyone to think about everything it is that's weighing them down and watch it float away.
"Watch it go into the sky and never come back again. You are on this Earth for a reason.
"Take the opportunity, take the gift. Don't waste it."
The family thanked those who turned out.
Ms Nkencho said: "Words cannot begin to describe the appreciation that my family have for each and every single one. Not all of you knew George, but some of you did.
"Regardless, you're all here standing here with our family. It's the love you have for me, my parents, my siblings that's brought you here and because you know what's right."
George's brother Emmanuel said: "It's hard to see him go like that. I wish that day had played out a different scenario than what I witnessed.
"I personally think there's many other ways that the scenario could have played out, I wish it did."
Mr Nkencho was shot multiple times outside his home in Clonee.
He was allegedly brandishing a knife and threatened gardaí before he was shot.

A delighted family said they were "absolutely thrilled" to be reunited with their stolen dog, who was found after a woman in England spotted her on a website.
Bernard and Liz Ahern, from Midleton in Co Cork, got an early Christmas present when their beloved pet dog Ruby was safely brought home last month.
Ruby had been stolen from her kennel last June and the family reported the theft to local gardaí in Midleton, who shared an appeal via the Garda Southern Region Facebook page.
Their post was viewed by almost 100,000 people - including a woman in the England who had seen Ruby for sale on a website.
With the help of Somerset Police, Ruby was found and made the 500km journey via Rosslare back to Midleton in time for Christmas.
The Aherns said: "We are absolutely thrilled to have Ruby back home. We are so grateful to the lady who spotted Ruby for sale, the Somerset Police, and our gardaí here in Midleton."
Superintendent of the Midleton District, Adrian Gamble thanked all of those who helped bring Ruby home, as he urged pet owners to take extra safety measures.
"We are delighted to have been a part of Ruby's safe return to her loving family and appeal to all pet owners to take all extra security precautions and ensure their pets are microchipped."

Number of Covid cases in hospital set to reach twice peak of first wave

The number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 this week is likely to reach double the numbers seen at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic here, HSE chief Paul Reid has warned.
The health service is set to come under increasing strain in the early part of this week, as the numbers requiring in-patient treatment has given rise for concern.
Figures released yesterday showed that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) was notified of 6,888 new Covid-19 cases, with 1,452 patients hospitalised. A total of 125 people were in intensive care units (ICU).
There had been 100 additional hospitalisations over the previous 24 hours.
In addition, eight new deaths were reported.
Of the cases reported yesterday, 2,088 were in Dublin, 862 in Cork, 469 in Limerick, 405 in Wexford, 320 in Waterford and the remaining cases were spread across all other counties.
"Early this week, we will likely be at double what we had in the peak of last year," Mr Reid said yesterday, adding there was concern at the rising trend.
He said that there were 37 vacant adult ICU beds and 11 vacant paediatric ICU beds across the health system yesterday morning.
Speaking on RTE's This Week, he said a 'surge' agreement reached with private hospitals to access beds and give further capacity for patients had already been triggered.
"Private hospitals are already taking some urgent care, non-Covid care and support, so we have in essence triggered those processes already," Mr Reid said.
Critical
Meanwhile, consultant in infectious disease Professor Mary Horgan, who was recently appointed to the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) told the Herald that: "My experience of the last week or so, it really has been all hands on deck.
"People have been redeployed," she said.
"They are all trying to get over, probably the next two weeks, in managing the patients coming in, but also trying to keep non-Covid pathways that are really critical to patient care open also, because people obviously need time-critical surgery, or people will come in with heart attacks, strokes, trauma.
"So it's trying to keep those two parallel pathways open so everyone gets managed."
Prof Horgan, who is based at Cork University Hospital, pointed out that "the numbers coming in versus the numbers being discharged is always a challenge at the moment".
The chief executive of one of the country's largest hospital groups, UL Hospitals, warned the pattern of Covid-19 is rapidly worsening across the mid-west region, as 427 of her staff were unavailable for work due to the virus.
Over a four-day period, from last Tuesday to Friday, the number of staff unavailable for work within the UL Hospital Group, across Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, had jumped from 140 to 427.
In an email sent to politicians last Friday, Colette Cowan, chief executive of the group, warned that "the pattern of the disease across the region over the holiday period has been one of rapid deterioration".
Ms Cowan added that the 14-day incidence rate across the region had also "increased significantly".

Pre-Christmas splurge gifts retailers 6pc bounce on 2019

Consumers returned to their old shopping habits with gusto for a pre-Christmas and post lockdown shopping spree.
The December reopening of non-essential retail saw customers flocking back to stores, pushing up spending by 6pc more than in the same month last year.
Many sectors saw record levels of spending at what is traditionally their biggest month of the year anyway, according to the latest consumer spending figures released by money app Revolut.
The data from the company, which says it now has more than 1.2 million customers in Ireland, shows that almost all retail sectors saw December sales increase year-on-year.
This includes jewellers, clothes shops, toy shops, sportswear retailers, electronics stores, bookshops and household appliances sellers.
Spending in jewellers was up 17pc in December compared with the same month last year.
Clothes shops got a 16pc bounce.
But sportswear shops were the real winners with a 53pc sales surge. Not far behind were toy shops, where sales were 45pc higher.
Of the main retail categories, only two performed worse than last year. Both department stores and shoe shops saw spending fall by 12pc compared with December 2019.
Retail experts said the scale of the spending spree will ease some of the concerns of retailers who may have wondered whether shoppers would return following the six-week national lockdown in October and November.
Overall, two-thirds of December's consumer spending was carried out physically, with a third taking place online.
Effective
This marked a significant return to physical spending compared with last November, when 54pc of all spending took place online.
The compilers of the report said Irish businesses have improved their performance when it came to online shopping, suggesting that 'buy Irish online' campaigns such as 'Champion Green' have been effective.
In December, 43pc of all online shopping by Irish customers was with Irish businesses - up from 35pc in December 2019.
This compares favourably to December 2019, when only 35pc of Irish e-commerce spending was with Irish businesses.
December also saw a continued massive spend on all things digital: games, apps, movies, music, and streaming services.
The information is based on the spending activities of Revolut's one million customers here. But it is thought to reflect overall patterns.
Revolut's data has to date been used by the Department of Finance in five official 'Emerging economic trends' publications.
All spending data is adjusted for the growth in Revolut.

Pressure grows on Trump to quit as impeachment calls intensify

Two Republican senators now say US President Donald Trump should resign as support for the drive to impeach him a second time is gaining momentum in his final days in office.
Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania yesterday joined Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski in calling for Mr Trump to "resign and go away as soon as possible."
Ms Murkowski, who has long voiced her exasperation with Mr Trump's conduct in office, said on Friday that Mr Trump simply "needs to get out."
Mr Toomey said that even though he believes Mr Trump committed impeachable offences in encouraging loyalists in the Capitol siege on Wednesday, he did not think there was enough time for the impeachment process to play out.
Mr Toomey said that resignation was the "best path forward, the best way to get this person in the rear view mirror for us."
Scattered
However he was not optimistic that Mr Trump would step down before his term ends on January 20.
The White House had no immediate comment last night.
The House appears determined to act despite the short timeline.
Late Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to her colleagues reiterating that Mr Trump must be held accountable.
She told her caucus, now scattered across the country on a two-week recess, to "be prepared to return to Washington this week."
"It is absolutely essential that those who perpetrated the assault on our democracy be held accountable," Ms Pelosi wrote.
"There must be a recognition that this desecration was instigated by the president."
Republican Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, said "it may be Tuesday, Wednesday before the action is taken, but I think it will be taken this week."
Mr Clyburn said he was concerned that a Senate trial could distract from the process of confirming President-elect Joe Biden's nominees.
Mr Clyburn said one option could be giving Mr Biden the "100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running and maybe we'll send the articles sometime after that" to the Senate for a trial.
He said lawmakers "will take the vote that we should take in the House" and that Ms Pelosi "will make the determination as when is the best time" to send them to the Senate.
Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has said an impeachment trial could begin as early as Inauguration Day.
Republican David Cicilline, a leader of the House effort to draft impeachment articles - or charges - accusing Mr Trump of inciting insurrection, said that his group had grown to 185 co-sponsors.
Lawmakers planned to formally introduce the proposal today in the House, where articles of impeachment must originate.
The articles, if passed by the House, could then be transmitted to the Senate for a trial, with senators acting as jurors.
If convicted, Mr Trump would be removed from office and succeeded by the vice president.
Complicating that decision about impeachment is what it means for Mr Biden and the beginning of his presidency.
While reiterating that he has long viewed Mr Trump as unfit for office, Mr Biden on Friday sidestepped a question about impeachment, saying what Congress does "is for them to decide."
A mob of Trump supporters overpowered police, broke through security and rampaged through the Capitol on Wednesday, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were putting the final touches on Mr Biden's victory over Mr Trump in the Electoral College.
The crowd surged to the domed symbol of American democracy following a rally near the White House, where Mr Trump repeated his bogus claims that the election was stolen from him and urged his supporters to march in force toward the Capitol.
Five people, including a Capitol police officer, died as a result of the siege.
Mr Trump has become increasingly isolated, holed up in the White House as he has been abandoned by many aides.

Surge in hotspot 'prompted by people returning from UK'

The rapidly spreading UK variant of Covid-19 is feared to be behind a significant infection surge in Co Mayo.
The latest figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), released last Thursday, show that one in every 50 people in Belmullet had caught Covid-19 over the previous 14-day period.
Health chiefs in the county believe the high influx of returning emigrants for Christmas from the UK is behind the spike in cases.
Belmullet has the highest individual incidence rate in any local electoral area in the State, with 266 positive cases in a population of 12,600, or 2,111 cases per 100,000.
Local GP Dr Keith Swanick said that while the situation appears to be easing in terms of transmission, he believes there are difficult times ahead.
In recent days, Dr Swanick has called for the Government to introduce local curfews for hotspot areas like Belmullet.
"Calling for a curfew is almost past tense now that the figures have plateaued, thankfully," he said. "But it has been a challenging period for the town.
"We have to crush the transmission of this virus. It is about fostering that inner strength in the community, and I know it's there.
"The seriousness of this has landed and people will come together, I have no doubt.
"But introducing local curfews in hotspot areas is something the Government should consider in the future.
"We don't know what this South African variant is going to bring. The situation here is that Covid-19 is affecting all cohorts of society.
"People diagnosed a week ago are now becoming ill. Young people are getting very sick with this too.
Severe
"All we want to do as medical professionals is preserve life. There is no other agenda in this. All we want is to keep people safe."
Dr Swanick also called for the Government to offer priority vaccination for frontline healthcare workers in areas in the grip of a severe surge.
"If frontline workers go down with illness, an already serious situation gets even worse," he said.
On Friday, in an unusual move, the HSE, An Garda Síochána, and Mayo County Council issued a joint statement urging people in Mayo to follow health advice.
They said the recent rise in figures for those contracting the virus in the county was "extremely concerning".
Dr Breda Smyth, HSE director of public health in the west, described Mayo's infection rate as "really worrying".

Teeth could hold key to identifying remains found at railway

Carbon dating may be needed on the teeth of a skeleton found in Cork to determine the age of the woman and how long her body had been lying beside an old  railway line.
The revelation came as gardaí are understood to be making "significant progress" with their investigation into the grim find at Roxborough, outside Midleton, last Tuesday.
Detectives believe they are dealing with the remains of a woman, who was possibly aged between 55 and 80 years.
It was initially suspected the remains were historic, dating back to the early 20th century and those of an adult male, possibly linked to the War of Independence.
The body is believed to have been at the site of the railway line for a number of years - but one source indicated the find is more recent than initially believed.
An examination of cloth and clothing found by the bones indicated that patterns could still be determined - suggesting that weather exposure had not totally destroyed or erased details.
DNA and dental records are now critical to helping solve the mystery.
However, carbon dating on the teeth could clarify the timeframe involved.
Missing
Gardaí believe the bones, some of which were found wrapped in cloth with a small piece of religious jewellery, are more recent than initially suspected.
Preliminary indications are that the remains do not fit the profile of any of Cork's major missing person cases.
The remains were found by workmen clearing part of the old Midleton-Youghal railway for conversion into a €19.8m greenway.
A workman operating a digger last Tuesday was shocked to see what he immediately feared was a human skull.
The area was sealed off and an examination of the site by gardaí yielded further bones.
The clothing fragments are also consistent with those normally used by an older woman.
The highest profile missing person case in Cork is Tina Satchwell from Youghal, who was 45-years-old when she vanished on March 20, 2017.
Searches off both the east Cork coast and in a Castlemartyr woodland failed to reveal any clue of her whereabouts.
However, preliminary indications are that the remains found in Midleton are those of a much older woman and that they have likely been in situ for longer than five years.
Gardaí believe the piece of religious jewellery could prove crucial in identifying the remains.

A young woman was arrested for Garda obstruction after she threw away a bag and tried to discard a mobile phone outside a Dublin prison.
Jodie Keegan (21) was seen walking across wasteground near her home towards Wheatfield jail and tried to pull away from arresting gardaí.
Judge David McHugh fined her €100 after hearing she was with someone else at the time and was easily influenced.
Keegan, with an address at Cherryorchard Green, Ballyfermot, pleaded guilty.
Blanchardstown District Court heard gardaí on patrol at Cherryorchard Green saw the accused walking across wasteground towards the prison.
When they approached, Keegan fled and discarded a bag.
Vulnerable
She then tried to get rid of a mobile phone and pulled away from gardaí when they stopped her.
She had no previous convictions.
The accused was a "vulnerable lady" who had been in the presence of someone else at the time of the offence, her solicitor Lorraine Stephens said.
This person managed to leave the field before gardaí arrived, she said.
The accused, who had left school before her Leaving Cert, "would be subject to influence very easily," Ms Stephens said.
The judge said having heard the facts, he would take it as being "nothing more or less" than discarding the bag.
However, he said he regarded the charge as "significant" and fined and convicted the accused.

€2m Callely home up for sale to pay off debts

Disgraced former minister Ivor Callely's family home is up for sale to pay off property speculation gambling debts.
The Victorian-era listed property on one of the most sought-after addresses in Dublin is on the market for almost €2m. The five-bed house also includes a snooker room, which is currently adorned with a large painting of tigers, redolent of the former Fianna Fáil TD's past as a Celtic Tiger property developer.
The house is being sold by Mr Callely's estranged wife, Jennifer Foley, on foot of a court order to sell to pay debts.
The house on St Lawrence's Road in Clontarf went on the market before Christmas with a 'For Sale' sign going up last week. The family bought the house in the early 1990s when Mr Callely's political career was on the rise. But the work on the house played a pivotal role in his political downfall.
Resigned
Mr Callely was a Fianna Fáil TD from 1989 to 2007. He served as a junior minister in Bertie Ahern's government until he resigned in December 2005 after revelations that one of the country's biggest construction companies paid for work carried out at his home in the early 1990s.
He lost his seat at the next election and was appointed a Senator by Mr Ahern in 2007.
He was jailed for five months in 2014 after he admitted fraudulently claiming €4,207.45 in expenses from the Oireachtas on forged mobile phone invoices between November 2007 and December 2009.
However, debts from property investments have led to the sale of the home. Mr Callely transferred his home into the ownership of his estranged wife a decade ago, a move which also had the effect of placing it beyond the reach of creditors at the time. The couple have since separated.
Last year, a finance company obtained summary judgment for €1.5m at the High Court against Mr Callely over loans for property investments. Mr Callely opposed the application by Everyday Finance DAC but Ms Foley reached a settlement with the company involving her consenting through her lawyer to judgment for €1.5m against her.
A stay applied on the judgment against Ms Foley until the summer and Everyday also agreed not to seek to sell the property at St Lawrence Road, Clontarf, where Ms Foley is living, before then. The property is now being sold on foot of a court judgment.
The house is on the market for €1.95m. Given the location and condition of the property, interest is expected to be high.
The ground floor has three formal reception rooms, a large family kitchen and a dining room. Upstairs are five bedrooms, including a master bedroom with dressing room and en-suite bathroom.

'Money mule' linked to feud gangs faces more jail time over €10k crime cash in bank

A 20-year-old criminal with links to the gangs involved in serious organised criminality in Drogheda is due to be sentenced next month in a landmark money mule case.
Sean Everitt, from Hill View, Drogheda, Co Louth, is already serving sentences for drug dealing and aggravated burglary but he can expect more prison time after he admitted having €10,000 in his bank account which was the proceeds of crime.
It is understood he was to be paid about €1,000 for the use of his bank account which he hoped would go towards paying off a drugs debt to one of the violent gangs involved in the deadly Drogheda feud.
Busted
However, Everitt was caught after he unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw the cash from a bank in August, 2019, in an incident which was caught on CCTV.
Sources say that the bank had the money locked and gave information to the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) who had set up a major investigation codenamed Operation Random.
This investigation began after over 200 customers of an Irish bank became victims of a major €2.7m phishing scam in which they provided their bank details after receiving a bogus text message that led to their bank accounts being cleared out.
The international crime gang behind the massive theft then used money mules such as Everitt who allowed their bank accounts be used by the crime organisation to withdraw and deposit money stolen from other accounts.
GNECB detectives identified 56 money mules across the country and 39 of these people have now been arrested.
Everitt was the first person to be arrested in Operation Ransom when fraud squad detectives brought him from Cloverhill Prison for questioning in October, 2019.
At that stage, he was on remand in the jail on charges of possession of cocaine totalling €16,000 and cannabis resin worth €19,000.
On November 16 last year, Everitt was handed a four-year jail sentence for this offence at Drogheda Circuit Court and given an additional four-year term for his role in an aggravated burglary in which a wheel brace was used to terrorise a family in Tullagh, Co Louth, in September, 2019.
He will be sentenced next month at Dublin Circuit Court for "possession of €10,000 believed to be the proceeds of criminal conduct" after he pleaded guilty at a court sitting in December.
A senior source told the Herald that Everitt is "not typical" of most young people who act as money mules, the vast majority of whom are teenagers without previous convictions.
"He got involved through pure criminality but in many other cases students who have never had any involvement in crime become money mules," the source said.
"The organised crime gang use social media, particularly Snapchat, to find people who will allow their bank accounts be used to launder money and they often target students who receive very little reward for letting their bank accounts be used - once they get involved they lose complete control of their accounts."
Hotspots
The average age of those arrested as part of Operation Ransom is 19 and among the suspects detained as part of the investigation is a 20-year-old Clondalkin man who had €44,000 in his bank account.
Investigations also established that in Limerick, a young man used the account of his 15-year-old brother to launder a large amount of money.
Of the 56 people arrested so far, at least 19 are Irish nationals.
GNECB have also identified "hotspots" for money mules in Kildare, Limerick, Mallow and Galway and anywhere where there are third level colleges across the country.

3.3 million doses of jab on way but not for months

Ireland's limited supply of Covid-19 vaccines - the key weapon for escaping the worst of the pandemic - could be boosted early next month as the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab may be approved earlier than expected.
But it will be next summer before millions more inoculations will be available for the wider population.
The green light for the vaccine would mean three supplies are available to administer to older residents and staff of long-term care and frontline healthcare workers by February.
The HSE is promised more than 40,000 doses a week from Pfizer/BioNTech over January and February while 4,000 doses of the Moderna jab are due next week.
The possible arrival of vaccines from Oxford/AstraZeneca - regarded as a "game changer" by health officials because it is easy to store - could speed up the rollout.
It will make it easier for GPs and pharmacists to be brought on stream to administer vaccines to the wider community, said Professor Karina Butler, chair of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.
Non-healthcare professionals, once trained, could also be called upon to administer the vaccine as the programme ramps up, she added.
"The logistics will be simplified with this vaccine," Prof Butler told the Herald.
"It will be hugely beneficial to the system, not only because there are large quantities scheduled to come in but because of the handling characteristics.
Surgeries
"It will be suitable for administration in GP offices and pharmacies and for administration in large centres that will be set up."
"That doesn't mean that GPs might not come on board sooner.
"But in terms of doing this in their own surgeries, with their own patients, this is much more suitable.
"The handling characteristics will be much easier."
Health officials insisted yesterday they are stepping up the administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab to long-term care facilities and frontline healthcare staff with 35,000 expected to have been immunised by tomorrow.
More than 180 long-term care facilities will be offered the vaccine next week and the plan is to have all residents and staff given a first dose in the next 16 days.
The HSE plans to hold a week's supply in reserve and all other doses will be administered. However, opposition politicians who were briefed by task force chairman Prof Brian MacGraith and health officials yesterday said the plans are still too vague.
There are around 2,000 vaccinators including staff who deliver jabs in schools and trained hospital staff.
Army
Talks are also under way with the Army to use some of its medics as the campaign broadens. Work has also begun to finalise where mass immunisation sites will be around the country.
Later this year, Ireland can also expect a further three million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine following a new deal reached with the European Commission yesterday.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that along with the Moderna vaccine also authorised for use in the EU, "we have already secured an amount of doses that we need to vaccinate 380 million Europeans, and this is more than 80pc of the European population".
Meanwhile, a new study indicated that the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will not be affected by the two more infectious virus strains from the UK and South Africa, both of which are currently circulating here.

Foley and unions agree on Leaving Cert but no deal on schools' return

Education Minister Norma Foley, teacher unions, and other education partners have agreed they want the Leaving Cert to go ahead - but are no closer to getting sixth years back into to the classroom.
Less than 24 hours after teacher unions pulled the plug on plans to reopen schools on Monday for 60,000 Leaving Cert students and 18,000 pupils with special needs, a new round of talks was under way. Ms Foley had separate meetings with the education stakeholders from primary level and post-primary level, which were later described by several participants as positive and constructive.
When the new school term kicks off belatedly on Monday, it will be a return to remote learning for more than 900,000 pupils, until the end of January at the earliest.
While yesterday's meetings agreed there should be a return to the classroom at the earliest opportunity, with priority for Leaving Cert students and special needs pupils, there was no discussion about the circumstances in which that would happen.
At a meeting on Thursday, public health experts told the education stakeholders that schools were safe and that they had no difficulty with the limited return proposed for Monday. However, shortly afterwards, the Association of Secondary Teachers' Ireland (ASTI) said it had not received sufficient assurances, particularly around the new Covid variant, while the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI) also expressed health and safety concerns.
Both unions instructed their members not to co-operate.
Parents of children with special needs have been devastated they are not returning to school on Monday.
Ms Foley told yesterday's meetings she wanted to put measures in place immediately to ensure a meaningful continuity of education for these pupils.
The minister is meeting representatives of three advocacy organisations - Inclusion Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland and the autism charity, AsIAm - on Monday.
Mainstream
AsIAm chief executive Adam Harris said they wanted home tuition to be made available to every student enrolled in special classes and schools and to students in mainstream education who were unable to learn remotely. At yesterday's meeting with second-level representatives, Ms Foley also asked about the Leaving Cert and whether everyone shared the objective of holding the traditional exams.
Her message was that if exam candidates don't get back to school soon, there will need to be discussion about a Leaving Cert Plan B.
There was a consensus around holding the exams, but she said it must be backed up by actionable commitments.
The discussions between the sides will continue, but no timeline has been set and with the current record Covid infection rates and ongoing uncertainty about its progress, no one was hazarding a guess as to when even students deemed as priority might be back in school.
This year's Leaving Cert candidates have already suffered serious disruption having been out of schools from March to June last year.

Gardaí 'hurt as man violently resisted arrest', court told

A man has been charged with assaulting two gardaí who were allegedly injured when they fell as he resisted arrest on a street in west Dublin.
It is alleged one officer suffered bruising to her head as Shane O'Malley (32) attempted to get away after being stopped for a search, Blanchardstown District Court heard.
Mr O'Malley, from Kilmartin Avenue, Tallaght, is charged with assault at Wheatfield Avenue, Clondalkin on September 19 last year.
Garda Sergeant Maria Callaghan said the DPP directed summary disposal of the case in the district court and gave a summary of the alleged facts so the judge could consider the issue of jurisdiction.
Fled
She said gardaí told Mr O'Malley he would be searched on the day and he fled, but was stopped a number of minutes later.
Sgt Callaghan said it was alleged the accused violently resisted arrest and as he made efforts to get away, the gardaí fell.
One suffered bruising to her head and a medical report was available, the court heard.
The alleged assaults happened in an attempt to flee, Sgt Callaghan said, and it was not alleged that Mr O'Malley "drew out and hit the gardaí."
The prosecution's case was that Mr O'Malley caused them to fall and become injured.
Judge David McHugh accepted jurisdiction to deal with the case and adjourned it to a date in February.
The accused has not yet indicated how he intends to plead.

Gardaí deal blow to 'The Family' drugs gang with €1m cash bust

A 45-year-old Lithuanian man who was arrested yesterday morning with more than €1m in cash in the van he was driving was moving the money on behalf of the notorious 'The Family' gang, senior sources revealed.
The suspect is being detained at Portlaoise garda station under anti-gangland legislation, where he is being questioned about "involvement in a criminal organisation, to facilitate money laundering, relating to the suspected proceeds of drug trafficking," gardaí said in a statement.
Detectives believe the arrested man, who is based in the midlands, had been moving the huge cash haul on for one of Ireland's biggest drugs trafficking networks.
Gardaí believe the cash was to be moved out of the country.
It is the second major cash seizure against the gang in just over three months after a multi-million euro seizure last year.
The west Dublin-based drug trafficking mob, led by convicted heroin dealer Brian Grendon (42), have been the subject of numerous raids by specialist garda units in recent years, but they remain one of the biggest drug dealing organisations in the State.
'The Family' gang have been using Dublin garages to launder money for years and in June, 2017, in a major operation by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) five car dealerships were raided and another three visited by officers in searches which yielded more than €1m worth of assets, including luxury watches and high-end cars.
Yesterday morning's operation involved members of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), intercepting a van on the M7 near Ballybrittas, Co Laois, at 6.30am. The seven figure cash sum was found in the vehicle.
Around €10,000 in cash was then discovered during follow-up searches in the midlands by detectives.
Brian Grendon, along with his older brother Philip, are classified as two of the main leaders of the mob, whose stronghold is in the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot areas.
Brian was jailed for six years in December, 2002, for the possession of €1.9m worth of heroin in a Palmerstown pub in November, 2001.
Brian's older brother Philip (45) is understood to have been released from a tough Spanish jail in 2018 after he was caught in a bizarre bust in August, 2014.
Spanish police arrested him after he threw one of two suitcases containing €3.8m worth of cocaine from a hotel window in a paranoid fit.
Speaking about the massive M7 cash seizure, Assistant Commissioner John O'Driscoll, who heads Organised and Serious Crime, said: "An Garda Síochána continues to pursue organised crime groups who are believed to involved in supplying illicit drugs within our communities, the motivation for which is financial gain.
Bizarre
"We again today have made a significant advance in our attempt to dismantle organised crime groups, by locating and seizing the suspected proceeds of their criminal activity.
"Despite our significant commitment to tackling issues associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, at this time, An Garda Síochána remains focused on protecting communities from serious and organised crime, including cyber enabled crime, drug trafficking and associated money laundering."

Lawlor murder accused case is 'a masterpiece of vagueness', says lawyer

The case presented against one of the men accused of murdering Dublin gangland boss Robbie Lawlor was "a masterpiece of vagueness", a court heard yesterday.
Counsel for Adrian Holland (37) claimed the charge depends entirely on complex, circumstantial CCTV evidence, number plate registrations and mobile phone analysis.
Lawlor was gunned down outside Holland's house at Etna Drive in Ardoyne, north Belfast on April 4 last year.
Prosecutors claim the 36-year-old underworld figure had moved north because he feared he was going to be attacked in a deadly feud.
But his assassination had already been commissioned three weeks earlier at a meeting in a Sligo hotel attended by an international drugs dealer, it has been alleged.
Neither Holland nor 45-year-old co-defendant Patrick Teer, of Thornberry Hill in Belfast, are accused of being the gunman. Instead, they were charged as part of a joint enterprise to murder, based on their alleged involvement in events surrounding the murder.
According to police, Lawlor went to Etna Drive in a pre-arranged appointment to collect cash.
Shooting
A gunman emerged from the property and opened fire, shooting him in the head and body. Lawlor died at the scene.
The attack is believed to have been part of an ongoing drugs dispute which claimed three lives in the past year.
Originally from Dublin, Lawlor was heavily involved in a bitter feud between rival Drogheda-based factions.
With both of the men charged with his murder still in custody, counsel for Holland challenged the case advanced against his client at a previous hearing.
"The outline of the facts by the prosecution was a masterpiece of vagueness," Joe Brolly told Belfast Magistrates Court.
Confirming Holland intends to apply for bail next month, the barrister requested police interview tapes and CCTV from a Tesco store in Crumlin, Co Antrim where Lawlor allegedly met a suspect on the day before his murder.
Footage from a hotel in Sligo where police claim a meeting was held to commission the assassination should also be disclosed, it was contended.
Accused
"The evidence against this accused is the coincidence of ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition), CCTV footage, and cell-site analysis of a mobile phone not recovered which the prosecution say is attributable to the accused," Mr Brolly added.
Crown lawyer Natalie Pinkerton responded that evidence is not ready to be disclosed at this stage, but added that she would take instructions on the material sought.
Adjourning the case for four weeks, district judge George Conner told defence representatives: "I suggest you put in writing the matters you are specifically asking for.
"I expect the prosecution to examine those matters and to release any documents that can be released at this stage."

Shop worker 'just couldn't resist' stealing from till

A shop sales assistant who pocketed more than €1,800 from the till was caught stealing by a CCTV camera directly over his head, a court heard.
Mohsin Shahzad (38) had not been dealing with cash for long and "just couldn't resist" taking it, a court heard.
Judge Bryan Smyth applied the Probation Act, leaving him without a criminal record after he repaid the money to the shop.
Shahzad, from Pakistan and with an address at Abbeyfield, Milltown, Dublin 6, pleaded guilty to theft at Spar on Church Road, East Wall on four dates last year.
Garda Seamus Donoghue said Shahzad took €773 last November 10 and put it in his pocket.
On November 17, he took €150 from the till during his first hour of duty and did not complete the transaction. The next day, also on the first hour of his shift, he took €70 from the till.
On December 5, Shahzad stole a total of €880 from the till in the course of 26 transactions.
Customer
The court heard the customer would purchase something, hand cash to the accused and Shahzad would ring the item in as normal and open the till.
However, when the customer left, he would place the money in his pocket.
There was a CCTV camera directly over his head, Gda Donoghue said. Shahzad was arrested at his workplace and made full admissions.
Judge Smyth asked why the accused had committed the thefts.
"He just couldn't resist," his lawyer said.
The accused had only been working for a few months "on the tail end of dealing with cash" when he took the money.
He "put his hands up" to the charges and had "learned his lesson," his lawyer said.
The accused, a student, had been in Ireland for seven years and had no previous convictions. His wife was pregnant.
His lawyer asked the judge to give the accused "one last chance" and not impose criminal convictions.

Skeletal remains found 'more recent than suspected'

Gardaí believe bones found next to an old Cork railway line, wrapped in cloth with a small piece of religious jewellery are female and more recent than initially suspected.
Detectives are now awaiting the results of pathology and forensic anthropology tests to determine if the remains are female rather than male.
They also want to find out if the remains date to a time period over the last five to 25 years.
It was initially suspected the remains were historic, dating back to the early 20th Century and those of an adult male, possibly linked to the War of Independence.
A painstaking excavation of the site at Roxborough off the old Midleton-Youghal rail line has yielded multiple bones, with a skull initially discovered on Tuesday evening by workmen converting the railway into a new €19.8m greenway.
The discovery of further bones, yielding almost a complete skeleton, has now led gardaí to suspect they are dealing with the remains of a woman and a more recent death.
One garda source indicated that "significant" material was also found in the area excavated. This included a quantity of disintegrated clothing and possible personal items of the deceased.
Most intriguing was a small religious token or piece of jewellery found with the remains.
Examined
The bones have now been removed to Cork University Hospital (CUH) for examination by assistant State pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster and a forensic anthropologist.
Tests will now be conducted to determine if all the bones are from the same individual.
A full list of missing persons from the greater east Cork area over the past 50 years is currently being compiled.
Among the highest profile missing person cases locally is that of Tina Satchwell, who was 45 when she vanished without trace from her home in Youghal on March 20, 2017.
A major garda search operation failed to reveal any trace of Ms Satchwell's whereabouts.
Gardaí said they are now awaiting the results of expert tests which will include carbon dating and DNA sampling.
One source said they were hopeful of identifying the remains given the condition of the bones, skull and teeth.
"Gardaí are continuing to investigate the discovery of suspected skeletal remains found in Roxborough near Midleton, Co Cork at approximately 4.30pm on Tuesday," a spokesperson said.
"The area remains sealed off as gardaí continue to carry out a technical examination. The State pathologist has attended. The outcome of these examinations will determine the course of the investigation."

A woman who was too drunk to stand when gardaí found her on a city street had been drinking a "huge amount of alcohol" to deal with a previous drug problem, a court heard.
Winnie Joyce (36) was given the benefit of the Probation Act at Dublin District Court when she was found guilty of public intoxication.
Joyce, of no fixed address, had pleaded not guilty but did not appear in court for the hearing of her case.
A garda said in evidence he was on beat patrol on Henry Street at 10.45am on June 8 when he found Joyce in an extremely intoxicated state.
Arrested
She was holding a bottle of vodka, smelled of alcohol and was unable to stand. She was arrested for her own safety.
Judge Bryan Smyth found the facts of the case proven.
The court heard the accused had 259 previous convictions for crimes including public order offences.
Joyce was "cross addicted" and had been drinking a "huge amount" to deal with what was a drug problem, her solicitor John Feaheny said.
Joyce was from a family that had had "brushes with the law." The accused was living from "hostel to hostel" and had a long road ahead of her, the court heard.

'Any day can be a horror show' - Pelosi calls for removal of Trump

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said US President Donald Trump should immediately be removed from office or Congress may proceed to impeach him.
Ms Pelosi joined those calling on the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to force Mr Trump from office.
It came a day after a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, forcing the building into lockdown.
Mr Trump called them "very special" people and said he loved them.
Ms Pelosi said at the Capitol: "The president of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America."
She warned he could do further harm to the country: "Any day can be a horror show for America."
Democrats and even some Republicans want Mr Trump removed before his term ends on January 20 with Democrat Joe Biden's inauguration.
The 25th Amendment allows for the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare the president unfit for office. The vice president then becomes acting president.
Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger and top Democrat Chuck Schumer have also called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.
In another blow to Mr Trump, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said she is resigning, becoming the highest ranking member of the administration to quit in protest after the insurrection at the Capitol.
Ms Chao, who is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, said the violent attack "has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside".
Chaos
Mr Trump only acknowledged his election defeat and promised an "orderly transition" after a day of chaos and destruction as a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol building and unleashed unprecedented scenes of mayhem in hopes of halting the peaceful transition of power.
Members of Congress were forced into hiding, offices were ransacked, and the formal congressional count of Electoral College votes was halted for more than six hours.
"Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20," Mr Trump said in a statement posted to Twitter by his social media director.
Mr Trump's own account had been locked by the company for posting messages that appeared to justify the assault on the seat of the nation's democracy.
Mr Trump added: "While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!"
However, President-elect Joe Biden called the mob that descended on the US Capitol "domestic terrorists" and laid the blame for the violence squarely at Mr Trump's feet.
During remarks in Delaware yesterday, Mr Biden said people should not call the Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol protesters.
He said they were "a riotous mob - insurrectionists, domestic terrorists".
He accused Mr Trump of "trying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans" who voted in November.
Mr Biden also said the president has "made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution, the rule of law, clear in everything he has done" and unleashed an "all-out attack" on the country's democratic institutions that ultimately led to the violence on Wednesday.
Mr Trump has spent the past two months refusing to concede and making baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud, even though his own Justice Department, federal courts, including the Supreme Court, and state governments have said repeatedly the vote was carried out freely and fairly.
His refusal to accept reality and his incendiary rhetoric reached a breaking point on Wednesday when loyalists violently occupied the Capitol in one of the most jarring scenes ever to unfold in the nation's capital of Washington DC.
Authorities said four people died during the violence, including one woman who was shot by an officer outside the House chamber.
Mr Trump later appeared to excuse the violent occupation by the mob.
"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long," Mr Trump wrote in a message that was later deleted by Twitter.
He added: "Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!"
Mr Trump spent much of Wednesday afternoon watching the insurrection on television from his private dining room off the Oval Office.
But aside from sparing appeals for calm issued at the insistence of his staff, he was largely disengaged.
Instead, a White House official said, most of Mr Trump's attention was consumed by his ire at Mr Pence, who defied Trump's demands by acknowledging he did not have the power to unilaterally reject the electoral votes that determine the next president.
Mr Trump only reluctantly issued the tweets and taped a video encouraging an end to the violence.
The posts came at the insistence of staff and amid mounting criticism from Republican politicians begging him to condemn the violence.

David Finn is among business owners who are calling on the Government to clear up the uncertainty around reopening dates.
Mr Finn, a hairdresser, owns the Style Bar in Portlaoise, Co Laois and said he would prefer to know now if the current lockdown is going to be extended.
He was responding to comments by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar who said: "If I was running a business now, I would be thinking it's a probability that I'll be closed until the end of March."
Mr Varadkar added the situation will be reviewed at the end of January.
Mr Finn said alerting businesses to a later reopening at this point could save them money: "You might be able to get rebate from insurance because you can negotiate that now in advance."
He does not have an issue with the current restrictions but is anxious to know what will happen beyond the end of January.
Reopening
"It has been stop-start and when we got going in December, I think a lot of us thought that was going to be the end of the lockdown for a couple of months," he said.
"There are costs involved with reopening so the more that happens the less inclined you are to be planning now for the end of January, when you don't know if that is going to be the case."
Mr Finn, who employs 18 people, said his business needs a time frame to fill or cancel appointments.
"So if people are booked in for February, do we need to cancel them?
"Likewise, if we knew we were reopening in March we would start opening up appointments books for that time but at the moment we can do neither."
Mr Finn said businesses have ongoing costs, even when they are shut.
"We have an online booking system. We pay a couple of hundred euro a month for it."

Dublin's three children's hospitals are having to curtail services due to the Covid-19 crisis, and children due to be seen in out-patient clinics will have to undergo virtual or telephone consultations instead.
The decision has been made by Children's Health Ireland (CHI) overseeing the hospitals at Tallaght, Crumlin, Temple Street and the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown.
CHI said that due to the rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the community and the need to reduce the number of people coming in, it will be prioritising emergency, urgent and time-sensitive procedures and care.
The paediatric emergency services at Tallaght, Crumlin and Temple Street will remain open 24 hours, seven days a week, and the Urgent Care Centre at Connolly will be open from Monday to Friday from 10am to 5pm.
Virtual
Time-dependent and urgent procedures will continue to be carried out.
CHI said that "insofar as possible, most out-patient clinics will be moved to virtual or telephone clinics unless specified by the consultant that a face-to-face review is needed".
The hospitals will be in contact directly with parents or guardians to advise if their child's individual care arrangements have been postponed.
"If you have not been contacted by the hospital, it is safe to attend for treatment and care," CHI said a statement.
This decision will be re- viewed weekly, depending on the level of Covid-19 in the community.
"The decision to curtail some services is to ensure our hospitals remain safe for patients and families and to protect staff in order to manage hospital care in the coming weeks," a spokesperson said.
CHI at Crumlin has a dedicated phone line should parents or guardians have any queries. Call 01 409 6117.

Government wants creches to refund parents for lost hours

The Government is exploring ways to force childcare providers to repay parents who are charged fees for services that can't be used due to Covid-19 restrictions.
There is concern among parents that creches will still charge fees for January so their child's place can be maintained. The average fee nationally was put at €736-a-month in one study in 2019 with parents in Dublin forking out an average of €1,000-a-month for one child.
Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman said he is asking childcare providers to refund parents whose children can't attend under restrictions.
The Government hopes this will be done voluntarily.
But the Department of Children confirmed last night that ways to enforce refunds are also being explored, and said many childcare providers are already offering them. It added: "The relationship between a service and parent is a private one based on a contract.
"The department is examining whether there are mechanisms whereby it can mandate services to repay fees."
On Wednesday Taoiseach Micheal Martin was asked about childcare providers seeking payments for January to maintain a child's place and whether this should be should be permitted.
Mr Martin said: "The minister will be engaging with the childcare providers and with the sector to iron out these particular issues."
Last night Mr O'Gorman told the Herald: "In light of the extensive financial support the State is providing to the childcare sector I am asking that providers would refund or credit those parents who are not essential workers and can't take up childcare for the next three weeks."
Meanwhile, Leaving Cert students will study remotely until the end of January after the Government performed a major U-turn on its decision to proceed with classes in schools three days a week.
Opposition
The move follows widespread opposition from teachers, parents, pupils and special needs assistants due to "grave concerns" amid the worsening Covid-19 situation.
Existing plans to reopen special schools next week are also to be scrapped.
"Unfortunately I am left with no alternative but to pause the limited reopening on Monday to allow further engagement with all education stakeholders," Education Minister Norma Foley said in a statement last night.
The Labour Party's education spokesman Aodhan O'Riordain said the Government has "averted a disaster".
Attention will now turn to the exams as students continue to voice their concerns about sitting the traditional Leaving Cert in the summer.
The decision to use remote learning follows one of the main teaching unions telling members to stay at home from school on Monday.
The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) called on its members to teach remotely and defy the Government's plan to allow classes go ahead for Leaving Cert and special needs students following a meeting with public health and education officials.

Homeless crisis inspires young scientists

Students have been showing off their ideas at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, including an innovative sleep 'pod' for people experiencing homelessness.
In the first ever virtual exhibition, 550 projects from 213 schools have been shortlisted to take part in the finals.
Second-year pupils Emma Greaney and Faye Murphy from Desmond College in Co Limerick designed a personal pop-up pod, which provides temporary shelter for the homeless.
"It's a pod for them to stay in overnight because they have nowhere to go, especially if they're not in shelters, which some of them don't want to go into because of certain rules that they don't want to follow, like not allowing pets," they explained.
"We decided it's not fair for them to sleep with no shelter or anything so we decided to make a pod for them."
The girls said they spoke to a former homeless person as part of their CSPE class and this inspired them to create something which would help other homeless people.
Sustainability
"We think homelessness is not addressed enough.
"There are 10,000 people homeless in Ireland nearly every  day and there's not enough people knowing about it and we want to make it more known," they added.
The exhibition saw a wide range of different topics this year ranging from sustainability to music.
Transition year students Niamh Clerkin and Briana MacCinna from St Louis Secondary School in Co Monaghan investigated the health benefits of listening to music tuned at different levels.
The students, who both play music, said they had found a conspiracy theory that claimed the standard tuning for most instruments can affect your heart rate.

The family of an Irish CNN journalist have told of their pride after he was praised for his cool coverage of the violence in Washington DC.
Donie O'Sullivan reported from outside the US Capitol as it was stormed by supporters of Donald Trump.
O'Sullivan, from Cahersi- veen, Co Kerry, also offered live updates from the streets as the clashes between Trump supporters, including far right groups, and police continued.
Four people died in the violence.
O'Sullivan's calm, informed coverage, often while being barracked by noisy protesters, earned him praise across the US, Ireland and other countries.
His mother, Noreen, admitted she feared for his safety as the scenes around the Capitol grew more violent.
She said she was relieved when the protests finally ended and her son escaped unscathed.
"We were watching it and my husband said it was great that Donie was keeping such a cool head," she said.
"But I was worried. I was off the wall a bit with fright. Watching it back afterwards at 3am, I thought he had done incredibly well to be so cool under pressure.
"He was very calm and level-headed throughout it all."
Dream
Mrs O'Sullivan, who is a US citizen, lives with her husband, Donal, in Cahersiveen.
She said she was proud of her son's work in Washington and admitted he was fulfilling a dream.
"Donie said he always wanted to be a journalist, we're very proud of him," she said.
Among those who praised his coverage were CervicalCheck campaigner Vicky Phelan and CNN anchor John King.
His reporting of the violence on CNN attracted such a following that his name trended on Twitter.
His sister, Sinéad O'Sull- ivan, a Cork-based law student, said the family were overwhelmed by the reaction.
"Everyone seems to know my brother now," she said.
"So proud of you Donie."
Ms O'Sullivan is no stranger to covering news events, having worked for University Express.
Her brother has worked in the US for a nearly decade and has been with CNN for five years.
He worked previously with CNN's investigations team, which has covered stories ranging from the rise of far right groups to the social media contro- versies arising from the 2016 US presidential election.
He also worked as part of CNN's Social Discovery team.

Leinster House security to be reviewed after deadly violence in Washington

Dail and Senate security is to be urgently reviewed foll- owing the storming of the US Capitol which forced lawmakers to evacuate the building.
TDs and senators have discussed the need to tighten security around the Dáil and Seanad amid fears that groups could target them in a repeat of the violence in Washington on Wednesday.
Rioters forced their way past security barricades at Capitol Hill, smashed windows and scaled walls to fight their way inside.
Four people died during the chaos, one from gunshot wounds and three from "medical emergencies", and 52 people were arrested.
Impregnable
The Leinster House Security Committee will report "as soon as possible" on measures that might be taken to strengthen the protections against assault by a mob or individual.
Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said the decision was arrived at "after looking at what happened on Capitol Hill and the ease of access that was witnessed to houses of parliament that many of us would have thought impregnable".
Here, armed military police are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the connected Government Buildings and Leinster House complex.
Besides Glock side arms, they have submachine guns, anti-riot equipment and gren-ades.
There is no direct threat at present to Leinster House, but a meeting of the Oireachtas Business Committee heard there is no room for complacency.
The need for a security review was raised by the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Mark Daly, at the Dáil's Business Committee meeting yesterday.
"We're not anticipating anything happening, but a security review would be appropriate," a source said.
Members of the security committee include the superintendent of the Oireachtas and members of the gardaí and Defence Forces.
Ministers are partly housed in Leinster House, while also having offices in Government Buildings.
Security plans are in place for any breaches at both locations, including escape routes and protocols.
Senators and TDs spoke in favour of a "comprehensive" review of security on Kildare and Merrion Streets, with some making the point that the "coarsening of public discourse" seen in recent years, largely on social media, means disorder can be more easily organised.
Doors and gates at Leinster House and Government Buildings can be automatically sealed off, both remotely and across the campus, a measure brought in after a man with a Samurai sword charged up the plinth in the wake of the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
He was overpowered by ushers and gardaí.
There was an incident with an anti-abortion protester verbally abusing TDs, including Fianna Fáil's Timmy Dooley, in recent years after gaining access as a visitor.
Vetting and background checks are carried out on visitors approved by TDs as part of the security process.
All ordinary visits and public tours have been paused for months as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Sources said any additional security recommendations that would be approved by the business committee on foot of the urgent review could be put in place "virtually instantaneously from a staffing point of view, although some technological proposals could take longer to install".
Explosives
Recent improvements in security include the installation of airport-style scanners to guard against concealed guns and other weapons or explosives and the use of pop-up anti-vehicle barriers.
Turnstiles have also been installed where there were none to discourage anyone from rushing the entrances or exits, while staff in those perimeter points are protected by bulletproof and blast-proof glass.
It is normal protocol for a crash barrier to be erected a few metres back from the main gate in advance of protests, but some politicians have expressed concerns that these could be easily breached.
"The crash barriers wouldn't hold a penny candle back," a source said.
Another noted that there is concern about the potential for groups opposed to vaccinations to stage protests in the coming months in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions.

RTE says sorry for its 'blasphemous' sketch

RTE will report itself to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and issue a public apology for airing a sketch that suggested God was involved in rape.
The broadcaster's Editorial Standards Board (ESB) has ordered the sketch from the New Year's Eve Countdown show to be removed from RTE's website as it "did not comply with RTE's own standards and broader regulations".
The show was condemned by Archbishop Eamon Martin as "blasphemous".
RTE received thousands of complaints from members of the public.
Refused
The broadcaster initially re- fused to delete the segment from the online version of the programme, but it will now do so as a result of the review by the standards board.
Part of a Waterford Whispers News sketch, the clip showed God being led away by gardai for "sexual harassment" offences.
The ESB said the sketch caused "undue offence" and did not give "due respect" for religious beliefs.
It also found it did not comply with the RTE journalism and content guidelines regarding sensitivity to people's religious beliefs.
RTE will make a voluntary disclosure of non-compliance to the BAI and engage with the authority in this process.
The broadcaster will also ask the ESB to review the processes involved in the broadcast and give a report.
It will remove the sketch from the RTE Player and carry a public statement and apology, with due prominence, acknowledging the sketch did not meet expected standards.
"This sketch was not compliant with our own guidelines or with our obligations under the relevant codes," RTE director general Dee Forbes said yesterday.
"On behalf of RTE, I fully apologise for that."

Speeding teen driver nearly ran into cyclist, court is told

A driver put a cyclist at "substantial risk of death" when he almost crashed into him during a high-speed road rampage, a court was told.
Mark Fagan (19) is alleged to have been driving at speeds of up to 120kmh in the incident.
Judge David McHugh ruled the case was too serious to be heard at Blanchardstown District Court and adjourned it for further directions from the DPP.
Mr Fagan, of Croftwood Green, Ballyfermot, is charged with reckless endangerment and dangerous driving on the night of July 7 and 8, 2019.
Detective Garda John Mc- Weeney said the DPP had consented to summary disposal of the case at district court level.
Colliding
He said a Nissan Almera was driven at speed on the Nangor Road, Clondalkin, going through red lights at the Kill- een Road junction and across Luas tracks before nearly coll-
iding with a cyclist at Kyle- more Avenue, Ballyfermot.
Det Gda McWeeney said the cyclist was put at "substantial risk of death".
The Almera overtook cars and crossed to the wrong side of the road.
It was being driven at 100 to 120kph and the roads were wet due to heavy rainfall.
The court heard the car went the wrong way around roundabouts at Cherry Orchard Avenue and Cedarbrook Way.
Judge McHugh refused jurisdiction and adjourned the case to next month for the DPP "to consider her position".
When the DPP consents, a book of evidence will be prepared and the accused will be returned for trial to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.

The "boundless energy" of a Galway teenager who died in a cliff fall was recalled by his father at his requiem mass yesterday.
James Harrison's remains were brought to St Ignatius Church, Sea Road, Galway for the mass at noon, which was celebrated by Fr Martin Curry.
The 17-year-old died after losing his footing while walking with family members in the Cinn Árd area of Dingle, Co Kerry, on Sunday.
Mourners were led by his father Matthew, mother Máire and siblings Daniel and Aoife.
Destiny
"Our three stars are everything to us. We may have lost an immortal part of ourselves, our bright, bright son and his destiny, but we can only hope that his light touches us for eternity," Mr Harrison said.
"We will love, cherish, hug him forever."
Mr Harrison paid tribute to his son, touching on his love for his family, school, the outdoors and sports, and "his dear friends who were dragged up mountains at 3.30 in the morning to see the sunrise".
"There was always another corner to turn for James, a walk never ended. There was always another place to see," he said.
He spoke of how James was "utterly fearless", while also highlighting his son's drive and energy on the pitch.
"It was also something that he took to school work, to everything, in fact," he said.
"James worked really hard at school. I was so lucky to have taught him for over four years.
"I was flattered that he wanted me to be his teacher. In his words, he lived his best life.
"He was a great friend to his brother and his sister. He loved Kent and his family there. He honed his bridge-playing skills there.
"He was deeply fond of his friends. He was a wonderful communicator.
"I imagine he was a very generous friend. He was deeply loyal to you all."
Addressing his son's friends, Mr Harrison said: "You were very dear to him."
James's love of Knockna- carra GAA and Knocknacarra Football Club were also highlighted.
"James was a wonderful, wonderful son," his father said.

'We're still playing catch-up on last year' - students call for more clarity over exams

Leaving Cert students are urging the Government to make a decision on exams sooner rather than later to avoid a repeat of last year's debacle.
Education Minister Norma Foley is determined the Leaving Cert will go ahead as normal in the summer, but with Covid-19 case numbers surging and schools set to close again, students are seeking clarity.
Pressure
Dublin student Sinead English (18) said the class of 2021 has been put under "significant pressure" to make up for time lost during fifth year.
"We're still playing catch-up at this point, and while we should be finishing our course around now, we're nowhere near finished," she told the Herald.
"Our mock exams are supposed to be going ahead soon and I don't feel prepared at all.
"There has been an increase in workload this year and an increase in class tests as teachers are preparing in case the calculated grades system is used again.
"Usually you have tests at the end of term or at the end of the month, but they were weekly."
The St Tiernan's Community School pupil said students are "left in limbo" as they have no idea if oral, practical or mock examinations will go ahead.
In the UK, it was announced yesterday that all secondary school exams will be replaced by school-based assessments.
The calculated grades system adopted here, where teachers graded students on past performances, caused much controversy.
A review of the system resulted in more than 6,000 pupils getting their marks improved after an error in the coding used to standardise the results was discovered.
Ms English hopes to study social science at UCD.
She would prefer to sit the traditional Leaving Cert, but is not against the idea of the calculated grades system once last year's issues are rectified.
"I am not saying the Leaving Cert should or shouldn't be cancelled. Personally, I find benefits to both options. One size doesn't fit all," she said.
"All students want is clarity. We want to know are we wasting our time studying and stressing over exams that might not even go ahead.
Delay
"If the practical exams are going ahead, please tell us. If oral exams are going ahead, please tell us. If our Leaving Cert is going ahead, please tell us."
Teachers are urging schools to delay mock exams for Leaving Cert students, given the worsening Covid-19 crisis.
"It is up to individual schools to adapt and change given the evolving situation," a spokesperson for the Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI) said.

Burglars steal 'substantial sum' during armed raid at man's home

Gardai are investigating an aggravated burglary that occurred in north Kildare in which three masked men armed with knives broke into a man's home.
The victim of the crime arrived at the property in Clane, Co Kildare, at 9pm where he was confronted by the armed gang who threatened him with a knife.
The gang had broken into the property when the man, who is understood to be aged in his 20s, was not at home.
Sources said that the gang escaped with a "substantial four figure sum of cash" following the raid.
The investigation is being led by officers based at Naas garda station.
"Gardaí are investigating an aggravated burglary that occurred at approximately 9pm on Tuesday, January 5, 2021, at a residence in Clane, Co Kildare," a garda spokesman said.
"It's reported a sum of cash was taken. No injuries to persons or damage to property was reported.
"No arrests have been made to date. Investigations are ongoing," he added."
Senior sources say detectives believe the home invasion in Clane is not linked to two other recent horrific aggravated burglaries in Co Kildare.
"This seems to be the work of a different crew," a source told the Herald.
On New Year's Eve, a 92-year-old man and his 89-year-old wife were terrorised in their Newbridge home when a gang of up to five masked men stormed their home.
It is understood that more than €8,000 in cash was stolen in the shocking incident in which the gang ransacked their home.
Detectives are investigating whether the same gang who carried out the Newbridge crime are also responsible for a similar burglary that happened in Athy, Co Kildare, on December 18 last, in which a 70-year-old man was badly assaulted and the criminals escaped with onlyaround €100.
No arrests have been made in either of these cases.
Meanwhile, in a completely separate investigation being carried out by Naas gardaí, officers plan to interview up to 30 people who may have information about a fatal assault on criminal Mark Loughlin (29).
Mr Loughlin was killed in Allenwood South in Co Kildare at around 4am on Sunday.
There have been no arrests yet in the case but sources say that a local man has emerged as a suspect.
"Up to 30 people need to be spoken to in relation to what happened in Allenwood and the belief is that this was a row between two different groupings of criminals," a senior source said.
The victim who is originally from Edenderry, Co Offaly, was previously jailed for firing a shot at gardaí in June, 2015.
Gardaí are treating the discovery of Loughlin's body just before 4am as being related to an earlier incident that happened at around 1am.

Businesses may be closed until end of March, says Varadkar

Business owners need to be prepared for the possibility that they may not reopen until the end of March, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has warned.
It came as the Government announced tough new restrictions aimed at stemming the massive surge in Covid-19 cases.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin urged people to face the coming weeks with "steely determination and resolve". He said personal decisions people make will "directly affect how many more people get sick and how many more people die".
Essential
Measures in place until at least January 31 include:
:: Schools staying closed to all but Leaving Cert and special needs students;
:: Childcare services like créches will be for essential workers only;
:: Work will halt on most construction sites apart from certain projects like hospitals and some social housing;
:: People travelling from Britain will have to produce a negative Covid-19 test.
Mr Martin, meanwhile, said people should "forget about take-away pints" and publicans should not be selling them as they can lead to gatherings that spread the virus.
Garda checkpoints will be returning today as part of additional policing measures due to Level 5 lockdown.
Static checkpoint under Operation Fanacht will recommence from 7am on national roads - not motorways - with random local mobile checkpoints designed to support the "stay home" message.
The Courts Service announced no new Central or Criminal Court trials would begin this month. Some longer trials involving larger numbers of defendants and witnesses had been due to begin at Croke Park but these will not start until February at the earliest.
Announcing the new restrictions, Mr Martin said: "We are in a battle against the deadly and ever changing virus.
"The lockdown we're introducing today is designed to reflect that stark and simple reality. Unless you're involved in absolutely essential work you have no reason to be away from your home."
Mr Varadkar said there is hope in the form of Covid-19 vaccines but the vulnerable must be protected until they can be inoculated.
"January is the month in which we all stay in," he said.
Mr Varadkar set out a timeline that would see nursing home residents, healthcare staff, very elderly people and those with chronic illness vaccinated by the end of March.
The hospitality sector has been closed since Christmas Eve and the Enterprise Minister was asked if pubs and restaurants may need to stay closed until then.
Mr Varadkar said the timeline he described is with use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and it could be stepped up more if the Astrazeneca one becomes available. But he added: "If I was running a business now I would be thinking that it's a probability that I'll be closed until the end of March."
Worse
He added: "In case I put the heart across people we will review the situation on January 30 and make decisions on restrictions then."
"The situation is deteriorating. It is very bad. It is going to get worse in our hospitals and ICUs. We're not going to be out of the woods by the end of January".
Supports like the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and weekly payments for businesses which are closed will continue until at least March 31 "in case things go on that long". He added: "I think anybody in the business community needs to be prepared for that possibility." Up to 500,000 people may end up on the PUP.
Mr Varadkar said the Government is engaging with banks to ensure they provide additional payment breaks to mortgage holders and people with loans who can't meet the payments as a result of the crisis and the response so far has been "positive".
Both Mr Martin and Education Minister Norma Foley spoke of how it's still the Government's intention to hold the traditional Leaving Cert exams this summer and said the public health advice is that schools are a safe environment.
Leaving Cert students will be able to attend their schools for three days a week under the Government's plan.
Mr Martin said the move would mean there would be around 61,000 people travelling to and from schools rather than more than 1m students and teachers if they were left fully open.
Asked about the possibility of a rebate scheme for parents paying fees for creches whose services they can't use, Mr Martin said Children Minister Roderic O'Gorman is examining the matter.
A Department of Children statement said Mr O'Gorman is asking that providers pause payment of fees or return fees paid in advance for parents who are not essential workers.
The resumption of the ECCE pre-school programme has been postponed until February 1 with other services open for the children of essential workers only.
A household of an essential worker, without an existing childcare arrangement, can form a bubble with another household so their child can be looked after.
Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said the ban on travel from Britain, which has been at the centre of an outbreak of a highly transmissible new strain of the virus, will be lifted on Saturday.
Passengers coming from the UK by air or sea will be required to produce a negative PCR test result they got within 72 hours of travel. Failure to do so could result in a €2,500 fine or up to six months in prison.
Mr Ryan said requirement for the test will be extended to other "red list" countries in the coming weeks.

McEntee confirms she has contracted Covid

Justice Minister Helen McEntee yesterday revealed she has tested positive for Covid-19.
Ms McEntee, who is pregnant with her first child, confirmed the news on Twitter.
"I was recently tested and have received a positive result for #Covid19," she posted.
"In line with our HSE guidance I am isolating. I am continuing to carry out my duties by working remotely, including attending Cabinet.
"The information the HSE has shows that pregnant women or their babies are not at a higher risk if we get Covid-19.
"At the same time I urge everyone to follow public health advice and stay at home. If you think you're developing symptoms, no matter how small, act as though you have Covid.
"We all know the seriousness of the situation. We must protect our health system and our most vulnerable."
The minister announced last month she is pregnant and is due her baby in May. She is the second Government minister to test positive for the virus.
Last month Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue confirmed he had contracted coronavirus.
It comes as the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has surpassed the peak of the first wave, the head of the Health Service Executive (HSE) said.
The previous highest number of patients with the virus in hospital was 881 on April 15.
Exceeded
Paul Reid, HSE chief executive, tweeted: "With 921 people in hospital, we've now exceeded the peak level of the 1st wave (881). 75 in ICU.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney yesterday also urged people to protect the health system.
"I know it's not easy for so many, but we must act together to protect people and our health system," he said.

Ministers told to name hospitals that refuse Cabinet deal

Cabinet ministers have been told to call out private hospitals that refuse to sign up to a new framework for providing care to public patients, as the health service comes under massive strain from Covid-19.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said hospitals that do not sign up to a deal cleared by Cabinet yesterday should be publicly named for not playing their part in the fight.
Three sources at the meeting confirmed Mr Varadkar's comments and said the Taoiseach agreed with the Tánaiste.
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly brought the new private hospital plan deal to Cabinet as the public health service was dealing with a record number of hospitalisations due to the virus and was rapidly running out of intensive care unit (ICU) beds.
Last night, there were only around 20 ICU beds available in the entire public sector.
Mr Donnelly said a "huge amount of work" had been put into the framework by the HSE and the Private Hospitals Association.
Urgency
"My understanding is that there are several hospitals very interested and my hope is that all private hospitals will sign up as a matter of urgency," the minister added.
Last night, the HSE sent copies of the framework to all private hospital groups apart from the Denis O'Brien-owned Beacon Hospital, which has decided not to sign up to the arrangement.
A spokesperson for the group said the hospital already provides care to public patients through individual arrangements with public hospitals and through the National Purchase Treatment Fund.
"Because of these arrangements, 20pc of the capacity of the hospital is currently being used to treat public patients and we expect this to increase as the volume of requests has increased," the spokesperson added.
The HSE framework for private hospitals will include three phases. These will be triggered at various stages, depending on the pressure on the public health service due to the spread of the virus.
The first phase would allow the HSE to take over 15pc of an individual private hospital, and the second would allow for 30pc.
In the third phase, the HSE would negotiate for further capacity.
The phases can be triggered when the incidence of the disease is at a particular level, when the R number is high and the public hospitals are under major strain.
Threshold
An independent mediator will decide if the threshold has been reached.
Private hospitals will continue to treat their own patients as normal, unlike during the earlier phase of the global pandemic.
A Government source said the current rate of infection in the country would automatically trigger the first two phases in the new contract.
Yesterday, Nphet reported 7,836 new cases of confirmed Covid-19 and 17 further of people who contracted the virus.
This takes the total number of cases in the State to 121,154, while the number of people who have lost their lives to the virus stands at 2,299.

Freezing conditions are setto continue for the next few days as much of the country endures a short, sharp blast of Arctic-influenced weather.
The snow and ice warning that was in place for the entire country overnight is expected to be lifted, but replaced by a cold-temperature alert.
Night-time readings will fall well below freezing, while daytime temperatures will not climb much beyond zero degrees.
There will be freezing fog in places and widespread frost and icy patches in the daywidespread.
A low of -4C was expectedforecast for last night, but that is expected to dip further tomorrow on Fridaynight.
The deep cold means any snowfalls can be expected to lie, particularly on high ground, and even light dustings are likely to make roads and paths treacherous.
Met Éireann meteorologist Aoife Healy said anyone out and aboutcarrying out essential duties in the coming days needs to take extra care.
"There's a cold front moving across the country and the cloud is building up ahead of that, but it does clear up behind that and it becomes quite clear and bright," she said.
"With the winter sun, however, if there is any snow lying, it can create a really powerful glare that makes visibility difficult - especially for drivers."
Transport Infrastructure Ireland said all preparations were in place to grit the roads, and 200,000 tonnes of salt was available at regional depots with 360 gritting trucks and 327 snowploughs ready to deploy if needed.
"It's an essential service so the restrictions won't interfere with that," said spokesman Sean O'Neill.

The annual BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition (BTYSTE) has been a very different experience for students this year.
The trip to the RDS, often involving long bus journeys from all over the country, could not go ahead as planned.
However, the show must go on despite the Covid-19 restrictions, and what better event to make use of technology to showcase the work of young people from all over the country?
In the first ever virtual exhibition, 550 projects from 213 schools have been shortlisted.
Vital
The opening ceremony was streamed from the Mansion House in Dublin and President Michael D Higgins launched the event.
"The Covid-19 pandemic has reaffirmed the critical importance of science as a vital tool for humanity, both to combat the transmission of coronavirus and to reduce the suffering and tragedy to which it gives rise," he said.
This year's winner will be announced online tomorrow and will be presented with a cheque for €7,500 along with the newly-designed BTYSTE perpetual trophy. In all, there are more than 200 prizes for individuals, groups, and teachers.
In Ballyshannon, Co Donegal, students from Coláiste Cholmcille examined the project "Is Covid-19 a catalyst for sustainability".
Joseph Harrison said he and Alessandro Cian decided to look at the subject because "Covid has made us do things differently with travel, work and education".
Also among those showcasing their projects online yesterday were students from St Kieran's College in Kilkenny.
The pupils conducted a project titled "An investigation into the effects of eating before sleep".

Three military camps are being adapted so that they can be used as isolation centres for Covid-19 patients.
They are the Coolmoney camp in the Glen of Imaal and Kilbride, both in Co Wicklow, and Kilworth camp in Co Cork.
The Wicklow camps were used last year to quarantine members of the Defence Forces before deployment to overseas peace missions.
The Defence Forces have been involved in establishing step-down medical facilities at Citywest in Dublin and the University of Limerick.
However, there has been no request from the HSE for the conversion of military facilities into field hospitals.
A military hospital, St Bricin's in Dublin, is also available for conversion and there is contingency planning to provide support for, and manning of, national body storage facilities in temporary morgues.
The Defence Forces are also working in close cooperation with the HSE to provide surge capacity in terms of swab testing and contact-tracing capabilities.
As part of Operation Fortitude, which was set up last March, the Defence Forces are providing support across four specific streams, known as the four Ts: testing, tracing, transport and tentage.
Ebola
Personnel have been supplying advice based on their experiences with the Ebola disease in Africa and working with the EU's Operation Sophia.
During the first wave of the virus, the Defence Forces provided personnel for testing, administrative and marshalling duties at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, with 44,064 tests carried out to date.
Additional frontline support was given over Christmas and this is set to continue.
Senior management have committed up to 56 military first responders to community health organisations, creating a capacity for up to 4,000 additional swab tests a day.
An extra 60 military personnel were trained by the HSE over the Christmas weekend to complement personnel from the Defence Forces and bring the total surge-support figure to 100.
The LÉ Eithne has been available as a logistics support base at Cork port, while other naval ships have been ready to back up shore-side test centres at Dublin and Galway ports.
Members of the Ordnance Corps were also involved with Aquila Bioscience in the development of AntiBioAgent decontamination wipes.

Gardaí are investigating the alleged impersonation of a government minister by a prank caller.
A caller to a restaurant seeking a table booking was abusive to staff and claimed he was junior minister Patrick O'Donovan.
Menacing
The restaurant contacted Mr O'Donovan and told him what had happened. He reported the incident to gardaí.
Officers are now investigating the matter as menacing behaviour.
The incident happened in Limerick on December 13 when the caller rang a restaurant in Rathkeale seeking a table.
The restaurant was booked out, and the caller then claimed to be Mr O'Donovan, a TD in Limerick. The manager subsequently called Mr O'Donovan to tell him about the incident.
When contacted, Mr O'Donovan would only say it was now a garda matter.
Gardaí confirmed they were investigating as it is illegal to impersonate someone.
A security source said the phone number would now be traced.

A Covid survivor, who lost her husband to the disease, has become the first nursing home resident to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.
Maura Byrne (95) was given the Covid-19 jab yesterday in Hollybrook Lodge, St James's Hospital's residential care unit in Dublin.
"I feel great at the moment," said the great grandmother of 15 after receiving the inoculation.
Chats
She has been unable to see her family because of restrictions but says she is very lucky and uses her iPad to keep in touch.
"I'm very very happy. I'm really happy. I'm lucky, I have an iPad so I have little chats. When I go back up now I'll say 'Look! I got the vaccine'," she said.
"It's lovely. They all have messages for you. I have 15 great grandchildren. The great grandchildren would be standing on their heads. They're really funny.
"The nurses here are very kind. It's a home from home."
Her husband Stephen died of Covid-19 last year and Maura was recovering from Covid-19 at the time, leaving her unable to attend his funeral.
"I buried my husband and I couldn't see him. I watched it on a phone. I wanted to touch my own (family).
Smile
"On my husband's card he told me that I could 'cry and want me back or smile and think of the happy days we had'."
Mary Day, CEO of St James's Hospital, said yesterday: "As Ireland's largest acute academic teaching hospital and home to Mercer's Institute for Successful Ageing (MISA), it is particularly fitting that the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine in a residential care setting took place today in St James's Hospital's residential care unit, Hollybrook Lodge.
"We know that Covid-19 has been particularly challenging for older people and vaccinating our older and vulnerable population and those who care for them is our priority.
"Thanks to all the residents and staff for their support in rolling out the vaccine."

'My world crumbled' - Liz Bonnin 'broken' over her mother's Covid death

Scientist and broadcaster Liz Bonnin has said she is "broken" after her losing her mother to the coronavirus.
In a hard-hitting social media post, the wildlife expert and environmentalist praised medical staff for their care and compassion during her mother's final days over Christmas.
However, she expressed her despair at the "mishandling" of the pandemic and her frustration that policymakers did not act on scientific advice.
She also pleaded for an end to the fear and division caused by misinformation and conspiracy theories and urged wealthy  nations to wake up to the "futil- ity of prioritising economic growth over environmental and human health".
Ms Bonnin, who was born in France but raised in Ireland, is now based in the UK.
 Her mother was in the care of the National Health Service there.
She said staff had shown her "how beautiful we humans can be - compassionate, dedicated, strong, selfless, brave, honest, empathetic - traits that as a society we seem to have forgotten we are all capable of as we continue to deepen the divides between us out of fear".
"I don't know how to start healing from the way Mum had to die," she said.
"What I do know is that she was a victim of the ongoing mishandling of the pandemic and the blatant misunderstanding of what it takes to contain the virus and, therefore, protect the economy.
"We didn't listen to and act on the science.
"My world crumbled as I watched her suffer the consequences of what we continue to prioritise in much of the global north at the cost of environmental and human health, in an age of blind partisanship, rampant misinformation and absurd conspiracy theories."
Ms Bonnin, who has a degree in biochemistry from Trinity College Dublin and a masters in wild animal biology, first came to prominence as a member of the girlband Chill. She then moved to children's TV.
However, she swapped the world of celebrity for science and has become one of the best-known faces in environmental programming, working for the BBC, RTÉ and Discovery Channel.
She recently joined David Attenborough in programmes on the climate and biodiversity crises and is president of the UK's Wildlife Trusts.
Despite her globetrotting career, she has retained close ties with Ireland and teamed  up with Professor Luke O'Neill for a series of Science Week broadcasts on RTÉ last  November.
She is usually protective of her private life but felt driven to address the issues raised by Covid and her personal loss.
"I dearly hope that in my lifetime we will wake up and reject our addiction to monetary gain and short-term political goals and recognise the true value of connectedness, community, well-being, kindness and caring for our planet and each other," she said.
'We didn't listen to and  act on the science,' said  grieving Liz Bonnin

'We may have to wait for first Moderna delivery' - Holohan

Chief medical officer Tony Holohan is warning that Ireland may face a wait for the first delivery of supplies of the new Moderna vaccine.
Around 880,000 doses of the vaccine are due here over the coming months and it is unclear how large the first shipment will be.
Dr Holohan said he does not expect the first delivery here to be as quick as with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, supplies of which arrived from Belgium within days of approval by EU medicines regulators.
"I don't know if it will be as quick as with the Pfizer vaccine, where the supply followed in short order," he said.
The European Medicines Agency held an early meeting on Monday to discuss the Moderna vaccine and may recommend approval today. Its human medicines committee could issue an opinion on the vaccine from the US company and approve it after today's scheduled meeting.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin yesterday said around 75,000 people in long-term care and a further 60,000 healthcare workers should have received two doses of the vaccine by the end of next month.
Deal
He said there were high-level assurances from Pfizer to supply the vaccine here for the next two months.
There was good news yesterday that Pfizer and BioNTech could reach a deal with the European Commission to double the supply of their vaccine.
The bloc, with a population of 450 million, has already ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has taken up an option to buy another 100 million.
Ireland is due to get 2.3 million doses this year. Everyone who is given the vaccine needs two doses.
Sources said the EU is seeking to buy 50 million or 100 million additional doses from the makers.
The new doses could be delivered between July and September, two sources said.
Possible
A European Commission spokesman declined to comment on numbers of possible orders.
However, on Monday he told a news conference the EU was trying to secure more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech in addition to the 300 million shots already booked
Meanwhile, Professor Karina Butler, chair of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee in Ireland, yesterday said that the rate of vaccinations in the first week of vaccination was deliberately slow as they wanted to ensure there were no technical issues.
Around 23 nursing homes are earmarked to share 3,000 vaccinations this week.
Dr Eavan Muldoon, a breastfeeding mother and infectious diseases consultant in the Mater Hospital in Dublin, was the first person to receive the vaccine among its staff yesterday.
"I wanted to demonstrate to mothers there is no reason to have concerns about receiving the vaccine while breastfeeding," said Dr Muldoon.

Arctic spike sparks fears of 'big freeze'

A sudden rise in temper- atures high above the Arctic is being monitored here for fear it could spark weather similar to 2018's big freeze.
The event, known as sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), can upset the polar vortex, which keeps icy weather moving in a predictable pattern around the North Pole.
When that happens it can disrupt the normal systems that influence winter weather in Ireland, Europe and much of the Northern Hemisphere.
An extreme example was the Beast from the East that paralysed the country in February 2018.
Mild
Met Éireann said it is too soon to know for sure how it might affect our weather.
The forecaster said the SSW could kick-start our typical mild winter weather pattern, which is currently held up in a cold spell.
"Every SSW is different and less than half lead to colder conditions in Ireland," it said.
"For example, the SSW in February 2018 led to the Beast from the East and Storm Emma, whereas the SSW in January 2019 had no significant impact here."
Confirmation of the SSW came just as Met Éireann issued its first extended weather forecast.
In a new service that began yesterday, a forecast for the month ahead is being issued every Tuesday and Friday.
The first one anticipates the continuation of the current cold, mainly dry spell for the rest of this week and much of next week, with temper- atures falling well below zero in parts of the west and north-west.
After that, a week of more unsettled and wetter weather with normal temperatures is indicated.
The remainder of the month and the start of February are expected to be wetter and probably milder than normal.

Cartel's 'notorious' hired gun jailed over bid to murder Hutch mob's 'Mago'

Caolan Smyth (28) is one of the most notorious figures in the recent history of Irish organised crime. He was actively invloved in multiple murderous feuds and survived attempts on his own life, while also plotting to kill his enemies.
Gardaí described his conviction at the Special Criminal Court yesterday as "highly significant".
Smyth was hired by the Kinahan cartel to murder one of their biggest targets - James 'Mago' Gately - in May 2017, but the Hutch gang associate was saved when four of the bullets fired by Smyth hit the bullet proof vest Gately was wearing.
The attempted murder happened as Gately (32) sat in his car at the Topaz filling station on the Clonshaugh Road in north Dublin at lunchtime on May 10, 2017.
The Lexus car which Smyth used in the attempted murder had diplomatic plates and was previously owned by the Pakistani embassy.
Bitter
Apart from his involvement in the deadly Hutch-Kinahan feud, which has claimed 18 lives, Smyth was also an active participant in the bitter Coolock feud in 2019 which led to five men being shot dead in north Dublin.
He has been formally warned by gardaí on numerous occasions about an active threat against his life.
Smyth, who is originally from Artane on the capital's northside, has been investigated for involvement in the double-cross murder of drug dealer Sean Little.
The 22-year-old was lured to Walshestown Road, Balbriggan, where he was murdered late on the night of May 21, 2019, when he was shot multiple times in the head.
As tensions increased in the weeks after this, Smyth fled the country. While he was away, he sent associates of Little the results of a bizarre lie detector test which he claimed proved he wasn't involved in the killing.
Chillingly, however, Smyth's efforts to prove his innocence were rebuffed by Little's associates who released a copy of the lie detector report on social media - alongside the picture which had been altered with the words: "You can send us all the lie detectors you want you dirty dog ... you're dead".
Smyth was lucky to escape with his life on the afternoon of September 14, 2019, when armed members of the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau were involved in a dramatic intervention in the Artane area and arrested Sean Little's father, Stephen Little (47), and major criminal Edward McDonnell (56) from Tallaght.
Stephen Little had vowed to avenge the murder of his beloved son Sean.
Earlier that day, a vehicle linked to the duo had been observed by undercover gardaí carrying out surveillance at Pearse Street flats - a location where Smyth had been living at the time with his partner.
Gardaí believe Smyth was to be shot dead that Sunday afternoon - which was the day of the 2019 All-Ireland football final.
When arrested by armed officers, Stephen Little told gardaí: "Had you given me another hour, I would have killed the b*****d that killed him. I have lost my marriage and my son."
Little and McDonnell were caught with a Grand Power G9 semi-automatic pistol at Lein Park, Harmonstown, when armed officers pounced.
Little was jailed for six years and McDonnell for nine at the Special Criminal Court earlier this year.
The court heard that gardaí recovered a loaded handgun under the passenger seat of an Audi car on the day before McDonnell was forcibly removed from the vehicle. Little had driven McDonnell to the scene.
While Smyth had a lucky escape on that occasion, he continued to be a major target for gardaí and his gangland rivals.
Patrols
While living in the flats complex in the south inner city, Pearse Street gardaí had to increase armed patrols in the vicinity after setting up a special policing plan to deal with the gangster's presence in the area.
Smyth also became embroiled in feuding incidents in Ballymun and Finglas due to his close association with a drug dealing gang operating in the area.
Sources said his behaviour was causing huge concern to specialist gardaí before he was eventually rearrested and charged in October, 2019, with the attempted murder of James 'Mago' Gately.
It is understood the Kinahan Cartel enlisted Smyth for this murder bid because at the time he had a relatively low profile in terms of organised crime.
Also enlisted for a role in the job was Gary McAreavey (53) of Gort Nua, Station Road, Castlebellingham, Co Louth, who previously had links to dissident Republicans.
McAreavey was found guilty at the Special Criminal Court of acting to 'impede an apprehension or prosecution by purchasing petrol and assisting in the burning out of the Lexus used in the attempted murder' at Dromiskin, Co Louth on the same day.
The court found McAreavey was on the phone to Smyth after the shooting, met him in Co Louth with a container of fuel and went with him to the 'burn site' for the 'comprehensive destruction' of the vehicle used.
It also found he lied to gardaí when he said he didn't know Caolan Smyth, whose numbers were saved on his phone.
Destruction
Both men will be sentenced at the non-jury court on January 25.
Presiding judge Mr Justice Tony Hunt said the case against Smyth was beyond any reasonable doubt that he took part in what was intended to be an "organised murder".
The prosecution case relied on mobile phone locations, phone-use being tied to the car's movements and positive Garda identifications of Smyth from CCTV at the filling station.
Shortly after the attempted murder, McAreavey was spotted on CCTV in Castlebellingham buying petrol, which the non-jury court found was used in the "comprehensive destruction" of the getaway car near Dromiskin.
The judge said Smyth was involved in "an organised hit' which was unsuccessful because Gately had been 'forewarned' of the danger to his life by gardaí and was wearing his bulletproof vest. It was the second attempt on Gately's life in the space of just six weeks.
A month earlier Estonian hitman Imre Arakas (62) was arrested by gardaí after they got information that he had flown into the country to murder Gately for a "five figure sum" which was offered by the Kinahan Cartel.
Arakas is serving six years in jail for conspiring to kill Gately.

Cocooner (24) upset as hip ops cancelled

Katherine Murtagh (24) has an autoimmune condition called systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and has had surgery appointments cancelled because of Covid-19.
The artist, who lives in Tullamore, Co Offaly, spent Christmas alone and said it was upsetting to see friends posting pictures on New Year's Eve.
She started studying art and design at Galway Technical Institute in 2019, but had to leave due to her condition.
Her hip was badly damaged when she was four-years-old due to her arthritis and she was placed on the urgent surgery waiting list only last year. She was due to get a replacement hip last March.
Pain
"Because I'm immunocompromised, the only time I've left the house is to go to prep for surgery and to get Covid-19 tests," she said.
"I'm hoping it happens this year as I know my body won't be able to get back to college without the hip replacement. I'm also in a lot of pain and have had a few falls."
For the past 10 months, Ms Murtagh's mother, who lives in Co Louth, has been delivering groceries and essentials.
"I think a lot of people think cocooners are over-65s, but it's also people who have any sort of autoimmune condition," Ms Murtagh said.
"It's frustrating to see people talking as if we should all be locked up while they go out. I have friends who saw me in hospital and were having parties on New Year's Eve, which was disappointing.
"My mental health completely deteriorated in lockdown, but you have to cope. There's no choice."

Gareth Lynch (39) was "not a good example" to the young children who were bystanders as he also threatened to headbutt the officer and shouted insults at her.
Dublin District Court heard it "wasn't a very pleasant experience" for the garda, who "bore the brunt" of Lynch's aggression on the day.
Judge Bryan Smyth spared him jail, giving him a two-month suspended sentence.
Lynch, of Pearse House in central Dublin, pleaded guilty to threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour and failing to comply with garda directions.
Garda Maria Harmon said she was on duty on Sheriff Street on January 7 last year when she saw three men being approached by another at the junction of Crinian Strand.
Suspicious
She became suspicious, and when she approached them, Lynch called her a "g** bag c**t" and said he would "slit my throat", she told the court.
Gda Harmon told him he would be arrested and he said he would headbutt her and moved towards her.
Members of the public were in the area at the time, she said.
The garda had "borne the brunt" of Lynch's aggression, but he came before the court a "very different person", his barrister Donal Pattison said.
Lynch could not recall the incident and was "shocked" at the evidence when his lawyer went through it with him.
He apologised in court and said: "I can't even remember that day."
Lynch had a drug dependency but was tackling this, Mr Pattison said. The garda had been a victim of the accused's addiction on the day.
"It wasn't a very pleasant experience for Garda Harmon to be called these names," Judge Smyth said, "and not a very good example to the young children who I understand were present."

Derby cup tie is a chance to make real statement

A place in the League Cup final is the prize up for grabs in tonight's contest, but the bigger picture may be the mood that is created by the result.
Both Manchester United and local rivals City head into this game on a high after some good wins over the Christmas period and the one that books a place at Wembley tonight will get a further boost to their confidence levels.
The losers will come away wondering whether their upturn in fortunes over the last few weeks has been a mirage covering up their flaws, with the incentive for both sides clear for all to see.
With Liverpool in the midst of their biggest blip in over two years after back-to-back draws were followed by a defeat against Southampton on Monday night, Manchester United and their neighbours have a chance to take advantage.
Yet when I have watched these two sides in action this season, I've often come away feeling underwhelmed by what they have served up.
I'm yet to be convinced that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the manager who will bring the glory days back to United, but you have to give him credit for getting his side into a decent position this season in the Premier League and what I still call the League Cup.
Having watched the first half of United's game at West Ham last month, it would be a polite understatement to describe them as terrible.
Their players looked uninspired, didn't chase down any ball, barely put a forward move together of note and were lucky to be only 1-0 down at the break.
What Solskjaer has got are a handful of forward players who can win a game with some moments of magic and after he threw Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford on for the second half, the game was turned around.
We have seen that time and again with United. In Fernandes, Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Edinson Cavani, they have attacking players with real quality.
When I look at the rest of their team, it looks pretty second rate, but top-class forwards can win you football matches and while I'm not convinced they will remain in the title race through to the end, those forward players are a real threat.
What of Manchester City? I'd say they are the primary challengers to Liverpool in the Premier League and they are capable of going on a ten-game winning run which might be enough to win a title race that has seen so many of the top teams dropping points consistently.
While I believe Pep Guardiola's side could go on a winning run, recent history tells us they will slip up sooner rather than later and it could easily be tonight at Old Trafford.
City will head into this game as firm favourites to win after they put Chelsea to the sword at Stamford Bridge last Sunday, but the hype around that performance has been misplaced.
City were decent, but Chelsea were so bad that it is hard to assess how good that performance was.
When you see Raheem Sterling being allowed to run half the length of the field before Kevin De Bruyne made it 3-0 for City before half-time, you appreciate the gulf in class between the two sides.
Chelsea manager Frank Lampard looks out of his depth in that job and it wouldn't surprise me if he sacked sooner rather than later, so let's see if City maintain their performance against better opposition.
City's defence will certainly be tested much more tonight at Old Trafford and recent history tells us they have not coped too well with United's forward line.
Guardiola's side are fantastic to watch when teams play into their hands, sit back and let them do what they do as well as any team in world football.
That's precisely what Chelsea did on Sunday, but United will make it tougher for them and we'll wait to see whether they can deal with it.
Ask me to pick a winner tonight and my advice would be to keep your money in your pocket and don't bother having a bet on this game as it's a complete toss-up.
Both sides have decidedly average defensive line-ups and it might well come down to which one cracks, as you can see goals flowing at both ends.
The fact that the League Cup semi-finals are being played over just one leg and with penalties after 90 minutes adds to the drama, so sit back on your sofa and lap up every second of it.
Everything else is in lockdown at the moment in Ireland the UK, but at least we still have football to keep us going at present.

Harshest lockdown measures return as construction shuts

The country is being put back into a full national lockdown with schools to close and most construction work to halt until the end of the month.
The Cabinet today will sign off on the most severe Covid-19 restrictions it has considered since the country was first put in lockdown in March last year.
The move comes against a backdrop of an escalating coronavirus crisis in Ireland with 5,325 new cases and 17 deaths reported yesterday.
Chief medical officer Tony Holohan warned the country is "experiencing a considerable surge in cases and hospitalisations" but added: "We can turn this around quickly if we stick to the measures we know worked last spring."
Last night, the Cabinet Committee on Covid-19 agreed to stop the majority of private construction developments. The move will mean some 50,000 construction workers downing tools.
However, essential construction developments such as social housing or schools ­projects will be permitted.
The measures will also see shops told to stop offering click and collect services. They will instead be asked to offer only click and delivery.
The Cabinet Committee also agreed on closing secondary and primary schools until the end of the month. However, the Cabinet will discuss ways to ensure students who attend special schools are not disadvantaged by the new lockdown restrictions.
Measures are being looked at to ensure Leaving Cert pupils are not negatively affected. The summer Leaving Cert exams could be delayed by a few weeks if Covid continues to cause serious problems.
Sources said the Government was adamant that the exams would go ahead.
One issue would be aligning a later release of results and CAO offers with the start of the college year, but results were delayed by three weeks in 2020 which, while an inconvenience, was well managed by the higher education system.
At the December meeting, the State Examinations Commission set out a range of options to the education partners, but the rapid deterioration in Covid infection rates, is presenting further challenges.
Meanwhile, travellers flying into Ireland will soon be required to produce a negative Covid-19 test on arrival.
The new rules will require anyone flying into Ireland to produce a negative PCR test result received within three days before arrival.
The ban on flights and passenger ferries from Britain and South Africa will be extended until midnight on Friday.
From Saturday anyone travelling to Ireland from Britain or South Africa will be required to produce a negative laboratory test received within three days before travel. They will also be required to restrict their movements for 14 days on arrival.
A date has not been yet set for when all travellers flying into Ireland will be required to produce negative test results on arrival.
At a lengthy Cabinet committee meeting, ministers were told a variant of the coronavirus originating in England has been found in 25pc of recent positive cases in Ireland.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin also said the new variant is one of the reasons the Government was forced to re-impose restrictions over Christmas.
Contradicted
However, the chair of Nphet's Expert Advisory Group Dr Cillian De Gascun contradicted the Taoiseach's claim.
On Twitter, Dr De Gascun said the variant is "not responsible for the recent significant and concerning increase" in new Covid cases.
He said the variant was only in 10pc of samples tested. Dr de Gascun noted his conclusion was on a small sample of 160 cases.
However, President of the Royal College of Physicians Ireland Mary Horgan said the sample size was too small to make a conclusion.

HSE drops plan to find source of outbreaks as cases surge

Plans to identify the source of Covid-19 outbreaks have been abandoned amid a sharp escalation in cases.
Contact tracers have placed more than 7,500 calls in a single day to inform people they have the virus.
The process of pinpointing the source of infections, by asking those infected to retrace their contacts over a one-week period rather than 48 hours, was due to be incorporated into the national tracing strategy last month.
Feasible
However, due to the recent surge in cases, the HSE said it has "not been feasible".
Lauded as a method of enhancing the protocols for tracing, the plan was initially endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) last September.
It was delayed due to the spike in cases in October and delays within Ireland's Testing and Tracing programme.
From early last month, as part of a "service improvement plan" for the contact tracing programme, tracers were due to carry out what the HSE described as "source identification" or backwards tracing on all routine cases of Covid-19.
The process would see people who pick up the virus also asked about their movements going back two weeks.
The previous strategy asked people about their close contacts and movements up to 48 hours before they developed symptoms.
The aim of "source identification" is to gather additional information on community transmission cases - where the source of the infection is unknown - and involves asking a series of questions in order to build a more accurate picture of where people are contracting the virus.
It can help with early treatment and to stop the spread to other areas and more people.
The HSE confirmed this week that the contact management programme "cannot prioritise Case Identification and Source Investigation (CSI) at this time".
The programme has been at peak escalation since before Christmas, a spokesperson said, adding: "Undertaking CSI is not feasible with the level of surge being experienced.
"The contact management programme was designed to significantly increase its capacity to deal with 1,500 detected cases every day by the end of December.
"On foot of a range of operational escalations and reconfiguration of service, we are now calling over 6,000 people every day.
Focused
"On Monday we called over 7,500 people to inform them of their detected result and take details of their close contacts.
"We are fully focused on responding to all detected cases and informing close contacts so that public health advice will be followed and close contacts will restrict their movements for 14 days."
The HSE said the CSI implementation will be considered when the current surge peak has been reached and the service is stabilised.

M&S blames a 'systems' issue for bare shelves

A photo of bare shelves at a store in Blackrock in Dublin was posted on social media, with many people wondering if it was due to extra red tape at customs hitting supplies.
The scenes here come after the British supermarket giant ran into problems with its supply chain in France.
There were reports of salads and sandwiches running out at stores in Paris in the days after Britain left the EU.
Goods moving between Britain and the EU have been subject to new customs rules from January 1 since Britain departed the free trade zone.
Here in Ireland, a spokesperson for Marks & Spencer last night said the bare shelves at some stores were due to a "systems" issue.
When asked to explain what this was, she said it was IT-related.
She said there was no further information to share when asked if Brexit was having any impact on supplies.
A shopper posted a photo of bare shelves at the Blackrock store that appeared to have shutters over some of the fridges.
"This is not just M&S, this is Brexit M&S (presumably)," said one tweet.
The shopper claimed she got less than half of what she needed.
Another person claimed the situation was the same at a store in Dundrum and said they assumed it was Brexit-related.
There were some other theories - one person said they hoped it was just a restocking delay after Christmas, while others wondered if the low level of products was due to people panic buying.
Apologise
However, in response to queries from the Herald, the supermarket blamed a 'systems' issue for the empty shelves.
"Due to a systems issue, some of our products are unavailable today," said the Marks & Spencer spokesperson.
"We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
It came after the retailer said that new trade rules in place after Britain left the EU had delayed deliveries of some fresh food to stores in France.
At least three branches were reported to have empty shelves during the week.
Items that were out of stock at Paris stores included black rice, sandwiches, fresh salads and curries.
In a statement relating to the situation in France, Marks & Spencer said it had prepared for changes associated with Britain leaving the EU in order to minimise disruption for customers.
The statement said it was transitioning to the new processes and it was taking a little longer for some of its products to reach stores.
It said it was working with its partners, suppliers and government agencies to quickly improve this.
Before Christmas, M&S warned it was facing increased costs as a result of Brexit.

'Never as concerned' - Nphet warns number of deaths this month could be huge

The virus will continue to sweep across the country at staggering levels and he has "never been as concerned " as he is now.
The chief medical officer was speaking as another six Covid-19-related deaths were reported, along with a further 6,110 new cases.
The best effort at this point is to mitigate the growing impact of the very aggressive growth in the virus.
The incidence of disease in the community is now at a level where vulnerable people need to stay at home unless it is absolutely essential, and there is serious concern about levels of infection in the over-65s.
Professor Philip Nolan said there is a possibility of 1,500-2,000 people in hospital and 200-400 in intensive care with the virus by mid-January if we do not act to radically reduce transmission and incidence.
"It will take all of us adopting the public health measures of staying home and reducing contacts, to suppress current levels of disease."
He said the underlying level of disease is now higher than last March and April.
The pace of the spread is moving so fast that the seven-day average figures do not really reflect the full picture.
There have been an average of 70-80 new admissions to hospital each day over the past week.
The seven-day incidence in people aged 19-24 is 900 cases per 100,000 and it is 400 per 100,000 in the 25-64 age group.
It is 200 to 300 per 100,000 in the over-65s and in people aged 13-to-18. While it is lower in these age groups, it is still considered to be very high.
Dr Holohan said: "If you have flu-like symptoms, it's unlikely to be anything but Covid-19 at this time. You must self-isolate."
He again appealed to people to limit their interactions with those outside their household and appealed to people to avail of outside supports.
"Leaders and organisations in communities across the country now need to support their colleagues, neighbours, family and friends to keep to the spirit of public health advice.
"We must restrict our movements, we have to limit the people we interact with outside of our households, if we are to suppress the virus and sustain our essential services."
He also said there is little point in the HSE expanding its testing system when the virus is spreading at such a rate.
The Department of Health refused to say how many positive tests were still in the HSE system and not yet validated due to a computer system which needs to be upgraded.
Meanwhile, eight residents died at a private nursing home over the Christmas period after a Covid-19 outbreak at the facility.
Pat Kennedy, chief executive of Windmill Healthcare, which operates Killeline Care Centre, Newcastle West in Co Limerick, said: "Unfortunately, and sadly, we must confirm that we have eight Covid-19 related deaths."
He extended sympathy to their families.

Harris denounces president over 'bold abuse of his power'

The Washington Post obtained a recording of the call, in which the US president repeatedly stated that there was "no way I lost Georgia".
During the call, Mr Trump made threats about criminal consequences and told the secretary of state he would be taking a "big risk" if the votes were not found.
Speaking in Georgia, Ms Harris called Mr Trump's conversation a "bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States".
"It was certainly the voice of desperation, most certainly that," she said.
Ms Harris was in Georgia to campaign for Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock ahead of today's Senate run-off elections.
During the call, Mr Trump urged Georgia's election officials to act quickly, and suggested that not doing so could endanger the political fate of senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Georgia Republicans.
Condemned
"You would be respected, really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election," Mr Trump said.
"You have a big election coming up on Tuesday."
The two Democratic Senate candidates were among those who quickly condemned Mr Trump for the call.
"When the president of the United States calls up Georgia's election officials and tries to intimidate them to change the results of the election, to disenfranchise Georgia voters, that is a direct attack on our democracy," ," Mr Ossoff said.
"If David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler had one piece of steel in their spine, one piece of integrity, they would be out defending Georgia voters from that assault."
In a statement, Mr Warnock called on Ms Loeffler to "speak out against the unsubstantiated claims of fraud, to defend Georgia's elections and to put Georgia ahead of herself".
"She has not and never will," he said.
Pathetic
Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said the call was "more than a pathetic, rambling, delusional rant".
Mr Trump vaguely threatened Mr Raffensperger and Ryan Germany, who is general counsel for Mr Raffensperger's office, suggesting that they would be subject to criminal liability if they did not find that thousands of ballots in Fulton County were illegally destroyed to block investigators, a baseless allegation.
"You are going to find that they are - which is totally illegal - it is more illegal for you than it is for them, because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it," he said.
"That's a criminal, that's a criminal offence. And you can't let that happen.
"That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer."

Many viewers were not impressed with the Waterford Whispers News sketch, which showed 'God' being led away by gardaí for "sexual harassment" offences.
Rocketed
The mock news clip features former RTÉ news anchor Aengus Mac Grianna reporting that "God has become the latest figure to be implicated in an ongoing sexual harassment scandal".
The clip received more than 600 complaints within 24 hours of airing, and RTÉ has since revealed that the number has rocketed.
"Since Friday, RTÉ has received approximately 3,500 emails and 1,250 calls regarding the Waterford Whispers sketch segment in the RTÉ One New Year's Eve Countdown programme," the broadcaster said in a statement.
"This takes into account emails to RTÉ's Complaints and Information Offices and calls to RTÉ's Information Office and to RTE's reception."
The Catholic Church spoke out about the controversial skit, describing it as "blasphemous", while Catholic Primate Archbishop Eamon Martin condemned the "outrageous" footage.
"To broadcast such a deeply offensive clip about God and Our Blessed Mother during the Christmas season on RTÉ and on the eve of the Solemn Feast of Mary, Mother of God, is insulting to all Catholics and Christians," he said.
Despite apologising for the skit in a statement on Saturday, RTÉ has since indicated that it will not remove the clip from the Player.

Schools may be shut until end of the month in new Covid plan

Primary and secondary schools were due to reopen next Monday but the Cabinet is set to consider keeping them closed for another two or three weeks.
The moves comes as 6,110 new Covid cases were recorded along with six deaths. Meanwhile, 776 patients remained in hospital last night after testing positive for Covid-19 while 70 people were in intensive care units.
Escalating
A Cabinet Committee on Covid-19 will meet to discuss the escalating public health crisis, and a key focus of the meeting will be on schools.
Education Minister Norma Foley will update the Cabinet sub-committee on the latest situation regarding schools.
Party leaders and ministers will consider asking schools to remain closed to stop the spread of the virus among students, teachers and their parents.
Plans are also being discussed to keep some schools open for the children of frontline workers and those with disabilities or who are from disadvantaged areas.
A Government source said schools would be closed not because they are unsafe but to stop the movement of around a million people.
It comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced all schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from today in England. Schools in Scotland will shut for the rest of January.
Last night, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said we are going to see a significant impact on the provision of education due to the escalating spread of Covid-19.
He said there are decisions to be taken by Government on the schools issue and they will meet this week.
He spoke to Taoiseach Micheál Martin yesterday about schools. While the transmission of the virus in school-going children is still below average it is increasing at a very fast rate.
He said they were looking at the contribution schools would make to virus spread.
"We have made clear that high levels of transmission pose a risk to all sort of activities," Dr Holohan said.
"We have successfully managed to protect children and education but you can see the position we are in now with very high levels of transmission.
"Those high rates now represent a risk to all of those objectives."
Surprised
Professor Philip Nolan, chair of Nphet's Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said the issue was not just what happens in schools but what happens "around the service".
Ministers across all three Government parties anticipate that schools will not fully reopen next week due to the rising Covid-19 cases and would be "surprised" if they did.
A Fine Gael minister told the Herald: "Schools will not fully reopen next week".
Meanwhile, a Fianna Fáil minister said they would be "very surprised" if the Government did not to keep schools closed for longer after delaying their initial reopening.
A Government spokesperson said: "Schools will be discussed at Cabinet committee and then Cabinet."
"The Taoiseach had discussions with the opposition leaders today to update them on the situation," he added.
Meanwhile, Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is understood to be cautious about the reopening of schools.
Ms Martin, a former schoolteacher, believes that even if Nphet recommend opening schools it will have to be done very differently to ensure teachers, pupils and their parents are kept safe.
However, Minister of State in the Department of Education Josepha Madigan insisted yesterday that there is no advice against reopening schools next week.
If schools do reopen, the primary teachers' union INTO wants them to have the flexibility to shut and use remote learning if Covid makes it too difficult for them to stay open.
That was part of a back-up plan presented by the union to Education Minister Norma Foley yesterday.
Up to now, schools had no authority to close to deal with the fallout from a Covid outbreak unless public health officials made such a recommendation.
In the first term, some schools took a decision to shut but were forced to reopen by the Department of Education.
But if the Government decides to reopen schools, INTO says principals must have more autonomy .
"We flagged a potential problem where large numbers of school staff may be absent when schools do reopen, and we want flexibility to move to remote learning where necessary," an INTO spokesperson said.

Abigail Rush (21) had to be pepper sprayed during the incident that happened after she drank alcohol while on medication, a court heard.
Judge Flann Brennan struck the case out, leaving her without convictions, after she made a charity donation.
Rush, of Seachnaill Place, Dunshaughlin, Co Meath, pleaded guilty to threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour, obstruction and violent behaviour in Kevin Street garda station.
Dublin District Court heard officers were called to Cardiff Lane in the docklands last September 7.
Restrained
The accused was hitting a glass door at the Clayton Hotel and shouting.
She said he had been trying to get a room and had been refused entry.
Rush refused to leave, became abusive to gardaí, resisted arrest and had to be restrained on the ground.
On the way to the garda station she freed herself from handcuffs and gardaí had to stop the van.
Rush tried to kick a garda and get out of the van and had to be pepper sprayed. At the garda station she refused to use water to wash her eyes and tried to kick an officer.
She should not have been drinking, the court heard. Her only memory of the incident was of waking up in the station "in a very poor state".
Rush was "remorseful, distressed and regretful".
"Thankfully, you didn't hurt yourself or anybody else," the judge said.

Suicide risk Assange cannot be extradited

Many experts had expected District Judge Vanessa Baraitser to allow extradition in the high-profile case, but she said the defence had provided compelling evidence that Mr Assange (49) suffers from severe depression.
The court had heard Mr Assange has written a will, sought absolution from a priest and that a razor blade was found hidden in his cell at Belmarsh prison in London.
Judge Baraitser said she relied on testimony from psychiatrists called by the defence, who stressed that Mr Assange was planning to kill himself if ordered to face trial in the US.
"The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future," Judge Baraitser said.
Mr Assange was at the rear of the courtroom, sitting in a glass booth, wearing a dark blue suit and a green surgical mask. He closed his eyes as he listened to the judge block his extradition.
His partner and mother of their two children, Stella Moris, wept as WikiLeaks editor in chief Kristinn Hrafnsson put an arm around her shoulders.
In her ruling, the judge said she had no doubt Mr Assange could have a fair trial with an impartial jury in the US.
Instead, she focused on the harsh conditions he could face if convicted.
She described America's supermax prison, the Administrative Maximum Facility or AMX, in Florence, Colorado, as a facility where inmates are kept in lockdown 23 hours a day with almost no human contact.
Mr Assange is charged with 18 federal crimes, including conspiring to obtain and disclose secret government documents, including sensitive military reports from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were released through the WikiLeaks website, as well as to journalists.
Prosecutors want Mr Assange flown by US marshals to Northern Virginia to face the charges, which expose him to 175 years in a maximum-security prison.
The US government will appeal to the British High Court to reverse the judge's ruling, a process that could take several months, perhaps even longer because of Mr Assange's poor health and the soaring outbreak of coronavirus in Britain.
Complex
As the extradition case has been long and complex, the High Court will probably agree to hear the appeal, said Nick Vamos, former head of the extradition unit at the Crown Prosecution Service and partner at Peters & Peters law firm.
Mr Assange was returned to Belmarsh prison  yesterday. He will seek release on bail.
His lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, said the defence will submit new evidence tomorrow to counter a previous ruling that Mr Assange is a flight risk.
Mr Vamos said that if the US government loses its appeal in the High Court, it can pursue a final appeal to Britain's Supreme Court.
In a series of hearings over the past year, Mr Assange's lawyers argued that the Trump administration is targeting him for "purely political" reasons.

Surgeries cancelled amid virus rise

Hospitals are at risk of struggling with between 1,500 and 2,500 Covid-19 patients by mid-January with potentially between 200 and 400 in intensive care.
There are just 286 fully staffed intensive-care beds.
A spokeswoman for the HSE said critical-care surge plans are in place if demand exceeds this, "but with the knowledge that this affects the standards of care for all critical care patients and that this has an outcome impact, particularly beyond 350 beds".
"As such, it is their advice that, where possible, demand should be controlled so as not to exceed capacity," she said.
The number of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital rose again yesterday to 776, with 70 in intensive care.
There was a jump of 92 hospitalisations in 24 hours.
University Hospital Galway is having to cancel all but very urgent time-critical surgeries for two weeks.
It will also be postponing outpatient clinics and some will be conducted virtually.
Fears
There are fears the impact of the cancellations will lead to more unnecessary delayed diagnoses and serious illness among patients with non-Covid conditions.
Although urgent care is being prioritised, there are concerns that some patients may deteriorate.
HSE chief Paul Reid said yesterday he expected to come to an agreement with private hospitals to take on some public hospital care later this week.
He described the impact on hospital intensive care as one of "high and extreme risk".
Around 3,000 staff are out due to Covid-19, either as a result of infection or because they are a close contact.

Virus surge must be met head on to avoid catastrophe

The more syringes there are injected into people's arms, the nearer we are to curbing the damage of the rampaging virus.
How well the HSE rolls out the vaccine will be key - but in the meantime there must be an urgency to deal with the surge of the virus which is racing out of control.
There are few enough levers to pull to avoid a catastrophe in the coming weeks and the predictions are grim.
Should schools remain closed? Should building sites be closed down? Should curfews and mandatory wearing of face masks outdoors be a new part of our armoury?
The worst is yet to come as thousands of people who are already infected after festive get-togethers are still unaware they have the virus and could be at risk of ending up in hospital or in need of a scarce intensive-care bed.
On Christmas Eve the warning signs of the fire to come were already being signalled with 922 newly diagnosed cases of Covid-19.
Yesterday, that had spiralled to 4,962 cases. The projection is for up to 7,000 cases a day, which is 15 times higher than in late November. It highlights how the virus is accelerating.
The unknown driver is the new strain of coronavirus which could account for up to 17pc of the current prevalence.
The new strain is seen as being able to raise the virus reproduction rate - which indicates how many people one infected person infects - by as much as 0.7.
Epidemic
It appears to be more transmissible in a higher proportion of people under 20.
Scientists in the UK said it has led to epidemic growth in nearly all areas there.
The reality is that we don't know the full extent of its impact in this country and there was a denial among some senior scientists about its faster-spreading power when it first came to light.
It means it is easier to catch, and although not more virulent in causing disease, it will leave those who are vulnerable at risk of getting severely ill.
The temporary ban on all passenger travel from Britain to Ireland remains in place.
Hospitals are again struggling and there is a growing risk they will have to dig into surge capacity. One of the most dangerous impacts of this is the consequences for patients with serious and life-threatening illnesses who do not have Covid-19.
Private hospitals may provide some form of safety valve, but it is disappointing that even at this point no deal has been done with them about taking on some of the work from public hospitals.
One of the features of the early part of the pandemic was the ability to treat many Covid-19 patients who needed the highest level of support in intensive care - this is credited with reducing deaths.
The fear now is that this may not be possible in a third wave.
Around 3,000 health staff are currently out because of illness or because they are a close contact and this will lead to major complications as hospitals come under further strain.

The 38-year-old intends to follow in the footsteps of predecessors including Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi by stepping down after three series at the helm of the Tardis.
Whittaker, the 13th Doctor, became the first woman in the role when she replaced Capaldi in 2017.
Co-stars Bradley Walsh and Tosin Cole departed the long-running BBC One sci-fi drama at the end of the New Year special.
Comedian John Bishop has been announced as new character Dan, who "becomes embroiled in the Doctor's adventures" and will star with Whittaker and Mandip Gill, who returns as Yaz.
Despite the shake-up, showrunner Chris Chibnall is set to stay.
Whittaker's departure will once again open up the role of the Doctor and prompt questions about a successor.
My Family and Death In Paradise star Kris Marshall has been linked with the role of the Doctor for a number of years and is favourite to replace her.
Successors
Coral bookmakers is also offering odds on Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Homeland actor David Harewood and Friday Night Dinner's Tom Rosenthal as potential successors.
Filming of the current series of Doctor Who is due to finish in the summer.
The BBC has said it will be shorter, with only eight episodes due to Covid-19 restrictions affecting production.

Mantas Simkas (34) was sentenced to three months in prison after a judge said his behaviour on the night was "appalling".
Simkas, a father-of-two from Orchard Lodge, Clondalkin, pleaded guilty to criminal damage to the patrol car as well as threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour and public intoxication.
Garda Sergeant Maria Callaghan told Blanchardstown District Court that gardaí went to Ninth Lock Road, Clondalkin on March 12, as it was reported that a woman was in a verbal dispute with her husband and wanted him to leave.
Aggressive
Mantas became aggressive to gardaí outside and jumped onto the bonnet of their car in an attempt to get away. "Minimal" damage was caused.
Simkas had been in Ireland for 15 years and was looking for work, his solicitor Valerie Buckley told the court.
She asked Judge David McHugh for leniency.
Judge McHugh said while the accused's guilty plea was "of value", the events of the night were "appalling" and he would impose a sentence.
Ms Buckley asked the judge to consider suspending it, saying she did not think her client was in his right mind at the time because of his level of intoxication.
Judge McHugh said the sentence was appropriate but set bail in the event of an appeal.

Mark Kane (37) and Keith Dixon (41) both punched another man who started the fight, while Kane also kicked a woman who was attacking his own wife.
Both accused were bound to the peace for a year after they admitted their part in the fight.
Kane, of Ashfield Park, Mulhuddart, and Dixon, from Cruise Park Drive, Tyrellstown, pleaded guilty to violent disorder.
Garda Claire Higgins told Blanchardstown District Court the incident happened at the Springfield Hotel in Leixlip, Co Kildare, on January 20, 2018.
She said an incident happened in the lobby at 2.10am after a wedding when an altercation was started by a third party.
Pulling
Dixon punched this third party a number of times.
Kane also got involved, punching and kicking the man who started the fight.
He also "kicked a female who was in the process of attacking his wife".
This woman was pulling his wife's hair and he kicked her "to get her off his wife", the garda said.
The fight lasted no more than two minutes and security intervened.
Neither accused had ever come to the attention of the gardaí before and both had been co-operative.
Judge David McHugh said Kane had responded to an attack on his wife but used more force than necessary.
The accused both over-reacted to the situation and were "deeply remorseful", their solicitor said.
Both accused were anxious to avoid convictions.
Judge McHugh said Kane and Dixon "weren't the people who initiated this matter, but regrettably, with drink involved, matters got out of hand".
He fixed recognisances in the event of an appeal.

Last night, she shared the first snap of the newly weds.
"A year ago Iain asked me to marry him and we had the most magical, perfect ceremony," she wrote on Instagram.
Planning
She said that they didn't discuss their engagement publicly as they "loved having it to ourselves" and had time to plan their wedding.
"We had been planning the perfect celebration and I will forever be so thankful that's what we got," she said.
The Bray native added that they were too busy "enjoying" being engaged, and later married, to speak about it publicly.
"We have never spoken publicly about our engagement or wedding.
"Back at the time we never felt the need to say anything as it's all such a personal experience. We also were too busy enjoying it," she added.
The photo, shared on Instagram, shows the couple posing together shortly after getting married, with Whitmore wearing a white suit and Stirling in a black suit.
"We've never shared this picture before now but a lot of people have contacted us and congratulated us the last month with good intentions so here's to good news," Whitmore said.
She signed off the personal post by wishing her followers a happy new year and "all the love".
"Sending love to you and yours and here's to 2021! Happy new year everyone! Wishing you all the love."

'We'll change law on naming murdered kids' - Martin

He said the Government will be in a position to do this early this year and spoke of the importance of transparency over the identity of those who are murdered.
Section 252 of the Children Act, 2001, provides mandatory and automatic reporting restrictions in the case of "any proceedings for an offence against a child".
In October, the Court of Appeal found that these prohibitions extend to children who have died.
As well as imposing restrictions on the media reporting important details of court cases, the ruling meant that parents whose child was ­murdered could not publicise charities in their child's name.
It also prevents adults who were abused as children from waiving their right to anonymity.
In a recent round-table interview with journalists, Mr Martin was asked when the law will be changed.
"It will be early next year (2021) that we will be in a position to do that," he said.
"I know the Attorney General is working on that with the Minister for Justice. It has to be changed and we will.
"The specific nature of how we do it, we will have to wait to see the detail of that.
"I believe in transparency on issues like that. Of course, we should know who is murdered.
"In certain circumstances it is essential (to know this)."
Last month, it was reported how a grieving father who wants to set up a charity in the name of his son will not be able to publicise it because of the court ruling on identifying children who are victims of crime.
The man, who lost his son and two other children in tragic circumstances, spoke of his "hurt and anger" over the ruling, which effectively gags parents in his situation from naming their children in the media.
Shout
The father-of-three, who also cannot be named because it could lead to the identification of his children, pointed out that all three of them had names and he said: "I need to be able to shout their names from the rooftops."
"I need to talk about (names removed for legal reasons) and I need to celebrate their all-too-short lives," he said.
"I'm only seeking that child victims be named so as to help us heal. Part of that healing is the promises I made to (names removed for legal reasons)."
The Court of Appeal ruled that a child who is dead cannot be identified when someone is charged with taking their life.
This ruling means the person charged with such a murder or manslaughter cannot be named if, by doing so, it would also reveal details of the young person.

Couple had 'no idea' FAI medals were being stolen

Gardaí are investigating the case after the medals, belonging to a founding member of the FAI, were stolen from the home of Marina and Alan Finley on the Howth Road, Raheny on Wednesday some time between 6pm and 11pm.
Mr and Mrs Finley were at home that evening, but heard no disturbance and had no idea that their house was robbed until the next day.
"We didn't hear anything," Mrs Finley told the Herald.
"We were on one side of the house and in the evening after dinner you go in and watch television and, maybe, you're half asleep."
Mrs Finley knew something wasn't right when the following day, she discovered that a bathroom near the safe had its window wide open.
"I would think this is a professional job and I'm only glad we didn't know they were there," she said.
Jewellery
The medals were taken alongside jewellery that the couple, who have been married for 61 years, had accumulated over a lifetime together.
Mrs Finley's father was Jim Younger, a founding member of the FAI in 1921 who served on various committees.
She inherited two of the medals from her parents, which are dated 1930-31 and 1934-1935, and feature inscriptions on the back.
While the couple have been informed that chances of finding the safe and their items are unlikely, Mrs Finley said she "lives in hope".
She said she doesn't know how the burglars knew of the safe or the medals inside.
"They might have been just lucky," she said.
Gardaí have appealed to anybody who may have found these medals or who can help in tracing their whereabouts.
"Gardaí are appealing to any persons who may come across these medals or who can assist gardaí in locating any of the items of the burglary to contact Raheny Garda station on 01 666 4300 or the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111, or any Garda station," said a garda spokesperson.

Covid-positive mum welcomes first baby of 2021 and says 'it's crazy'

But nothing could have prepared her for the news that came back from her medics - she had tested positive for Covid-19.
She would go on to have Ireland's first baby of 2021 in what has been described as "ironic" by the National Maternity Hospital Master, Professor Shane Higgins, given the current pandemic.
The Sallynoggin student was not due her first baby with partner Eric Brown until January 13 but both mum and her little boy Brody, who weighed 7lbs 10oz, are thriving.
She told the Herald how she was asymptomatic when she first entered the hospital but would go on to lose her sense of taste.
She received her Covid positive diagnosis on December 22.
"I came into hospital thinking I was having contractions and they said they would do a blood test and also a Covid-19 test," she said.
"It was a shock as everyone in my circle of close contacts have come back as negative except me so I've no idea where it came from."
She added: "My main concern was for the baby but after talking to the midwives and the nurses, they said anyone they've seen who had Covid didn't pass it on to the baby.
"So that was a relief to hear. They tested him this morning but we haven't got the results yet, so fingers crossed."
Given that she was also diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, medics decided to induce her on December 31 as a precautionary measure.
She said she had "no idea" she would welcome in the country's first New Year's Day baby and said having him after being diagnosed with Covid was "crazy".
The hospital said all proper protocols were followed to ensure the care of Jennifer and delivery of Brody.
"We weren't too sure when he'd arrive but one minute, we checked and I was only 2cm dilated and an hour later, I was at 10cm and we were pushing so it was quick," she added.
"I didn't actually think he was going to be the first. Holles Street was very busy last night, so I wasn't expecting it."
The Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Prof Shane Higgins, said it was "ironic" that the first baby born in 2021 was to a Covid-positive mum and encouraged all their patients to remain vigilant.
Meanwhile, Co Cork's first birth of 2021 was at one minute past midnight.
Busy
A baby boy was born to parents Karen and Michael Foley.
The first New Year's Day birth recorded at the Coombe hospital was with a baby girl who arrived in at 12.24am.
The new arrival, who has been named Kady, was born to parents Vanessa and Garry McLaughlin from Co Meath.
It will be a busy time in their household, given that baby Ava was born in the same hospital 19 months ago.
The first New Year's Day birth recorded at the Rotunda Hospital came at 12.31am.
Baby girl Ríona, who was born to parents Ursula Ní Shionnain and Dean Mac Aogáin from Dublin.

Gardaí ready to swoop on more suspects over intimidation of witnesses in Brady murder trial

Section: COURTS

The trial was the longest-running in the history of the State and continued amid an orchestrated effort to interfere with key witnesses.
Aaron Brady (29) was convicted of Detective Gda Donohoe's murder last August and is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum 40-year prison term for capital murder.
The Co Armagh man was also one of seven people arrested as part of the Garda inquiry into witness intimidation and perverting the course of justice.
The Herald has learned that detectives are expected to make more arrests as part of that investigation before submitting a file to the DPP.
Contact
Several women who made direct contact with key witnesses via social media during the trial are also the focus of the major inquiry.
Detectives are also investigating the hiring of Dublin criminals to intimidate witnesses.
Gardaí are hoping to bring a number of charges in relation to the campaign, including perverting the course of justice and using a mobile phone behind bars.
Four people with key testimony refused to come to court, but Brady was still convicted after two witnesses testified they heard him admit to shooting a garda in Ireland.
The inquiry is being led by gardaí in the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI) with a file expected to be submitted to the DPP early next year.
Investigations into the 2013 murder of Det Gda Donohoe are also continuing with gardaí watching the movements of key suspects in the case and liaising with international colleagues.
One of the men, known as Suspect A, is a US citizen and is frequently moving between the US and Ireland.
The man's brother - who is also formally classified as a suspect - is currently appealing a serious conviction in the US.
Another man, Suspect B, was linked to a number of high-profile raids earlier this year but his crime network has been curtailed as he is now under regular garda surveillance.
While gunman Brady and four others were directly involved in the Lordship Credit Union robbery, gardaí have identified more than 20 people who were either indirectly involved or have information about the murder of Det Gda Donohoe.
In early November, Brady was arrested in his Portlaoise Prison cell and quizzed in relation to the intimidation of witnesses.
Throughout the trial, gardaí and the prosecution repeatedly raised concerns about witnesses being interfered with.
In May, during a hearing from which members of the public were banned, it emerged that a video had been leaked online of a witness giving a statement on camera to gardaí.
Video
The video had been circulated widely on several social media platforms, branding the witness a "rat" and a "tout" while alleging they made the statement to secure a green card.
Presiding judge Mr Justice Michael White described it as the most outrageous contempt of court he had ever come across and said it was a sobering day for the administration of justice in Ireland.
Within hours, an investigation was launched by members of the Serious Crime Review Team attached to the NBCI.
Brady has appealed against his conviction for murdering Det Gda Donohoe.

Keane firm alleges bid to take back Iveagh Market is 'illegal'

The claim was contained in new accounts for the business behind Mr Keane's Oliver St John Gogarty pub, in Dublin's Temple Bar, which show the business continued to produce stellar profits before Covid-19 enforced shutdown of the business.
The new accounts for Mr Keane's Drayton House Holdings Ltd show the group recorded pre-tax profits of €4.9m in the 12 months to the end of last February 28.
The accounts addressed the move by Lord Iveagh to repossess the Iveagh Market.
The market, which was built in the early 20th century by the Guinness family, has been derelict for more than 20 years and the subject of a legal battle between the council and Mr Keane.
Last month, the council confirmed that it was notified by representatives for Lord Iveagh, a member of the Guinness family, that he had invoked the "reverter" clause contained in the original Deed of Conveyance dated July 1906. "Lord Iveagh has, in accordance with the terms contained in the Deed of Conveyance, repossessed the property this morning and notified the Council accordingly," a spokesman for the council said at the time.
In a note attached to the Drayton House accounts, it said a subsidiary within the group entered into a contract with Dublin Corporation to redevelop the Iveagh Market site in 2008. The note said a number of legal title issues relating to the premises and site have been ongoing since and still have not been fully resolved.
"In December 2020, action was taken by a third party attempting to take possession of the property," it said.
"In the opinion of the directors, having taken legal advice, the action was illegal and the subsidiary company is seeking legal redress to correct this situation," it alleged.
The note added: "The directors are confident the company's legal action will be successful and the company will be able to proceed with the proposed development of the site."
The note said the title continues to be held by Dublin Corporation, subject to the assertion of the third party noted above and therefore legal title has not passed to the company and will not do so until such a time as the legal matters are resolved and the development is complete.

OAP couple's terror as 5-man gang steals €8k in aggravated burglary

It is understood more than €8,000 in cash was stolen in the incident when the property in Newbridge, Co Kildare, was ransacked.
The elderly man is a well known member of the horse racing community and neither he nor his wife was injured.
Detectives believe the robbery was carried out by a local organised crime gang and they may have a breakthrough in the case after an imitation firearm used to terrorise the couple was discarded at the scene.
"This item will be the subject of a full forensic examination and the fake handgun could prove to be the undoing of this gang," a senior source said.
The Herald can also reveal that detectives are investigating whether the same gang were responsible for a similar burglary in Athy, Co Kildare, on December 18 last.
"It was very similar in that at least four men aged in their 30s stormed the house through the front door," a senior source explained.
"The unfortunate difference was that a 70-year-old occupant of the house put up a fight and he ended up being badly beaten with an implement.
"They then ransacked his home but got away with less than €100.
"Gardaí believe that the same local gang is involved in both incidents."
When gardaí were alerted to Thursday evening's aggravated burglary, officers were busy organising a raid on a shebeen behind a house in the town in which 15 punters were caught drinking alcohol.
"The information that was coming is that kegs were coming into that place every couple of days and it was a very organised situation," the source said.
"However this was not a commercial enterprise in the sense that no one was making a profit.
Crimes
"Gardaí believe it had been going on for some time and essentially involved a person organising matters for his buddies but what happened is a serious breach of health regulations."
Senior sources say the local crime gang suspected of the burglary also have links to the surge in thefts of catalytic converters from vehicles and a spate of other crimes.
"Gardaí in Newbridge are appealing for information following an aggravated burglary," a garda spokeswoman said.
"At approximately 5.15pm, the homeowner answered the front door to four or five masked men, who were armed with what was believed to be a firearm, and forced their way in the house.
"Both homeowners were uninjured during the incident but were treated for shock by paramedics.
"A large amount of cash was taken during the robbery.
"Gardaí are appealing to any person who may have information in relation to this incident to come forward.
"Gardaí are particularly interested in speaking with any person who may have seen anything unusual in Parc Mhuire between 5pm and 6.30pm yesterday evening.
"(They also want to speak to) anyone who can assist in the investigation to contact Newbridge garda station on 045 431212, the Garda Confidential Line 1 800 666 111 or any garda station."

Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman met with the Early Learning and Childcare Covid-19 Advisory Group yesterday to discuss the matter.
Representatives from the group shared concerns about the reopening of pre-schools.
While accepting the need to maintain early learning and childcare for priority groups, the advisory group asked for the pre-school programme to be aligned with the reopening of other schools  on January 11, and the minister agreed.
In a statement, the Department of Children stated: "By postponing the return of these children to the pre-school programme, social mixing will be reduced, which will help to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the post-Christmas period."
According to 2018 statistics from Early Childhood Ireland, this decision will affect almost 130,000, as well as their parents. The pre-school programme is being provided by more than 4,000 services nationwide.
Schools, early learning and childcare services are deemed to be essential under Level 5 lockdown.
This extends to include childminders who provide services other than, or in addition to, the pre-school programme.
The department described such childminders as providing "an essential service which supports parents to go to work".
As such, Mr O'Gorman has asked these services, which are private businesses, to reopen as planned from January 4 to provide childcare, particularly to priority groups.
The Department of Children stated that it will provide guidance to service providers relating to how they should prioritise demand for places within their services.

Prison workers get €1.16m for stressful working conditions

Officers in Portlaoise Prison are paid an "environmental allowance" due to the stressful working conditions at the jail.
According to figures from the Irish Prison Service, 317 officers earned €208,822 - or an average of €659 each - in the first half of last year.
In 2019, 330 prison officers were paid a combined total of €480,706 - or the equivalent of €1,456 each in the environmental allowance.
Altogether, €1.16m was paid throughout 2018, 2019, and the first half of last year.
The allowance was first introduced in 1982 as part of an agreement between prison bosses and the Prison Officers' Association to compensate for the "abnormal tension and strain" of working in Portlaoise Prison.
At the time, conditions at the prison were particularly difficult with a large number of republican paramilitary prisoners imprisoned there at the height of the Troubles.
The allowance is payable to all officers at the jail, including clerical staff based at the prison.
The payment was ceased in 2009 for officers newly transferred to the prison.
However, a civil service arbitration board later ruled it should be restored for all.
For staff that joined before April 1995, the payment works out at around €1,250 annually.
Contributions
For other prison officers who began service after that, the rate is slightly higher - because of higher pension contributions - and is paid at the rate of around €1,470 a year.
The Prison Officers' Association (POA) said the continued payment of the allowance was fully justified given the harsh pressures of working in Portlaoise.
The allowance goes back to the eighties and it has been subject to arbitration," said POA general secretary John Clinton.
"The type of prisoner you have there are paramilitaries or those involved in extremely serious crime, including gangland activity.
"We have nowhere else with these conditions - and that's recognised between ourselves and our employers."

They found 15 people socialising in a shed at the rear of a private dwelling and said that it "had all the trappings of a traditional pub."
Photographs released to the media yesterday showed the building had a pool table, a large-screen television, as well as a makeshift bar with a beer keg and a large urn for boiling water.
Gardaí took the details of everyone present at the scene and seized the intoxicating liquor along with bar equipment, including drink optics and spirit dispensers.
Investigations are ongoing and a full investigation file will be forwarded to the DPP seeking advice on how to proceed.

'More costs in doing business with Britain', warns Coveney

Mr Coveney insisted the worst impacts of a no-deal Brexit have been avoided after a trade deal was struck between the EU and UK just before Christmas.
However, the FG deputy leader said there will still be significant problems for businesses trading with Britain.
"We are going to see more disruption and more delay and therefore more cost on doing business and that's the downside of Brexit," Mr Coveney told the Herald.
Checks
"There's no such thing as a Brexit that happens without some disruption or inconvenience because what we're moving to is a far lesser trading arrangement than what we had before," he added.
Mr Coveney said the deal struck by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier does ensure there will be no quotas or tariffs on goods going to or coming from the UK.
However, there will be checks on goods coming into Ireland, and Dublin Port has been transformed to deal with a new regime for examining goods and checking certificates of goods coming into Ireland.
Mr Coveney said there will be some British products that will no longer be sold in Ireland due to transport delays.
He al so said some medicines and medical products may not have EU certificates that would allow them be sold in Ireland.
Mr Coveney had in the week leading up to the Brexit deal said there was a "real risk" the deal could fall apart but said in the end "all of Ireland's core vulnerabilities" were protected.
He said the Border was protected through the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Coveney said the country also avoided €1.5bn tariffs on trade. However, the minister said he was disappointed on the deal around fishing rights and said he is still working on improving the agreement for Ireland.
"One area where we've been asked to take some pain, which I'm not fully happy, is the fisheries," he said.
Disruption
"We are still working now on how we can ensure there is fair burden-sharing and of course how we can support the fishing sector through that disruption," he added.
He said the deal could be the "best of both worlds" for Northern Ireland despite the DUP voting against the trade agreement in Westminster.
Mr Coveney said the DUP supported Brexit yet opposed every solution put in place to try to address the Border on the island of Ireland.
"If you're going to keep voting against things you've also got to propose alternatives, and I've never heard a credible alternative to solve the issue of the Irish Border that doesn't involve either a backstop or a protocol," he said.

In his New Year's message, the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said the memory he will cherish of 2020 is how the power of love and care was able to overcome isolation, loneliness, suffering, despair and negativity.
"I will treasure a 2020 vision of goodness, kindness, generosity and courage shown by neighbours, volunteers, doctors, nurses, chaplains and other carers; by teachers, shop workers, clergy and so many others who devoted themselves to keeping our essential services going," said the archbishop.
He said the "amazing works of mercy were concrete expressions of the compassion, love and hope of Christ ringing out in our communities and world".
Dr Martin also expressed the hope that people will find faith, hope and love to meet what is likely to be another difficult year in tackling the coronavirus.
In a joint message, representatives of the Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic and the Irish Council of Churches said many people were hoping for a brighter and safer future in 2021.
Grief
The pandemic of 2020 had brought grief, anxiety and uncertainty as well as economic loss and disruption of livelihoods.
"Many aspects of life that we had taken for granted, like visiting loved ones in nursing homes, or popping in to see a friend, suddenly changed," they said.
They also paid tribute to the actions of frontline workers who, they said, had "sacrificially gone about their business".
They praised, too, those who delivered groceries for neighbours self-isolating or had sewn scrubs or kept in touch with others by phone.
Bishop Brendan Leahy of Limerick noted that many humorous WhatsApp messages had been circulating in recent days, celebrating the end of a year that has been "one of the worst in living memory for most of us".
While there was still so much work to do in overcoming Covid, there was "light at the end of the tunnel", with the vaccine being rolled out, he stressed.

Mr Ryan said it is "highly likely" estimated costs for projects such as BusConnects, Dart Plus and the MetroNorth will run over budget.
However, the Minister for Transport said the Government can get "better prices" when building during an economic crisis.
"The Metro and the BusConnects will go to planning the end of first quarter next year, certainly for BusConnects - and I think maybe slightly later for Metro but not that much later," he said.
"We need to go ahead and build these. Building in a crisis, you get a better price and you get housing close to where the public transport is going to go."
Signal
Mr Ryan said he does not have the full cost estimates for the projects but said he is "confident" he can get his proposals through Government as he sees them as the "right strategic investments".
"Those projects are still going to be needed. Metro will take five years to build but once we start, it gives a signal to the housing sector that 'yeah it's happening, that's where you build', and that's probably the most important thing," he said.
"There will be some who will come out and say 'well because of Covid, transport patterns are changing, we don't need the big projects'.
"I fundamentally disagree - and I've been involved for 20 years on the Metro. We still need it. And we need it because half of our housing in recent years was in the counties surrounding Dublin," he added.
Mr Ryan warned Dublin will "lose its attractiveness as a place to come and do business" if there are not radical changes to transport.

It comes as Level 5 restrictions are implemented across the entire country.
Gardaí will be engaging, explaining and encouraging people to follow public health guidelines, a spokesperson said.
They will also continue to engage in high-visibility patrolling in public spaces such as parks and other recreational areas.
Deputy Commissioner of Policing and Security, John Twomey, said compliance "must continue" until the public health crisis is over.
"An Garda Síochána's focus remains on helping to prevent the spread of Covid-19 by seeking public compliance with public health regulations," he said.
"Throughout 2020 we have seen high levels of compliance by the public. This must continue in 2021.
"Under Level 5, we are asking people to not make journeys unless they are essential. To minimise their contacts. To maintain social distancing. To wash their hands."
Mr Twomey said he wanted to remind people that not only will gardaí be policing, but they are also there to help, even if it is for a socially-distanced chat.
"I would like to remind people, particularly at this time of the year, that their local gardaí are here for them," he said.
Violence
"Whether that is collecting their prescription or some fuel or even a socially-distanced chat, please do not hesitate to contact your local garda station. We are here to help."
As part of Operation Faoiseamh, the public is reminded that the 5km restriction does not apply in the case of domestic violence or if a person is trying to escape the risk of harm.
"If you are a victim of abuse or know of a family member or friend who is a victim of abuse, that information is important to us," a garda spokesperson said.
"I ask that you make contact with An Garda Síochána."

The Jack & Jill Children's Foundation funds and provides home nursing care to 377 children.
It started 2020 with a calendar full of events to help raise the €3.5m it needs for its services.
However, the charity was forced to cancel all of its fundraising drives to generate the 80pc of donations it relies on.
Chief executive Carmel Doyle said Covid-19 restrictions "blew a hole" in its finances.
"We had to cancel everything and move all our events and fundraisers online as we have to keep going, just like the families we support," Ms Doyle said.
"Lunches, cake bakes, roadshows - all cancelled.
"Everything that we had, we had to cancel, so we issued an SOS appeal very early on in the year."
The children's care needs are very high, with more than 20 pieces of medical equipment in the home.
Another key part of the charity's service is end-of-life support at home.
Throughout the pandemic, the charity's nurses have supp- orted more than 30 children with end-of-life care.
"Our families and supp- orters mobilised as they know what could happen if we didn't have the funding," Ms Doyle said.
"We raise €3.5m annually, and that is 80pc of what we need. If we don't do that we are in trouble.
Relying
"One of the big things about relying on fundraising is the projections and looking at what could this mean to us by the end of the year, and we knew there was a short- fall far exceeding half-a- million.
"It was a lot to take in at the time.
"We looked at every grant we could apply for and then went to our supporters."
To help plug the gaping hole in finances, the foundation issued an SOS appeal earlier this year.
It also has nine shops it relies on for funding, but the Government's coronavirus restrictions meant it had to pull the shutters down.
The charity's nurses had to adapt their services to ensure they kept to the Government's health guidelines.
"It has been a tremendously challenging year," Ms Doyle said.
"Our nurses and carers are in the frontline of the community and we kept those doors open," Ms Doyle said.
"We have finished the year and pushed out what we could do.
"Covid and its effects are not going to go away quickly, and we've had to take a three-year look at our Covid response plan."
The charity won an award for its digital shift to move fundraising online, particularly its online auction, that which included the GAA shorts worn by Normal People star Paul Mescal during the hit TV series.

New year's sleigh: Button up, it's a frosty start to 2021

A band of snow showers brought a dusting of snow to many areas yesterday morning and the current cold spell is set to continue well into January
New Year's Day will remain cold, although it will be mostly dry and bright with sunny spells and the chance of just a shower or two.
After a cold New Year's Eve, most areas will see a mixture of sunny spells and cloudy conditions with showers mostly confined to the west today.
It will be mostly dry, but it will be a relatively cold day with highs of just 3C to 5C although it will be slightly warmer in the west, according to meteorologist Paul Downes.
There will also be widespread frost and icy patches.
Temperatures will drop again overnight to between 2C to -3C, with widespread frost and wintry showers likely on higher ground.
Showers are also likely in northern and western coastal counties today with a brisk northerly wind.
The first weekend of the new year will remain cold with freezing overnight temperatures.
Tomorrow will have another cold start with showers, some wintry, while "temperatures will struggle to get above zero", Mr Downes said.
Sub-zero temperatures will remain in place overnight on Saturday and Sunday, dipping down to as low as -4C and -3C respectively.
Sunday will stay cold, with daytime highs of just 2C to 4C in most areas but it will be slightly warmer in the north and north-west with sunny conditions but with biting winds from the north and north-east.
However, there is an increasing risk of showers in the east on Sunday afternoon and a chance of wintry showers developing, Mr Downes said.
The current cold snap is due to a high pressure system which is steering cold showers over us from Denmark bringing an increased risk of snow showers developing, especially on the east coast.

No increases to income tax for next five years, vows Taoiseach

Despite the rising cost of the pandemic and the estimated €25bn budget deficit, the Taoiseach said he will "honour the commitment" not to increase income taxes over the lifetime of the Coalition.
"Income tax, we have said, we're not going to increase," he said.
However, Mr Martin did signal some changes to the PRSI system to fund more social welfare supports for workers, such as pensions or redundancy payments.
Mr Martin said he is banking on people dipping into household savings they have accumulated during months of lockdown to help the economy rebound after the Covid-19 crisis.
The Fianna Fáil leader said the Programme for Government contains a commitment not to increase income taxes for the next five years.
"That said, we'll be borrowing about €40bn between 2020 and 2021.
"The deficit this year is about 6.5pc. 5.7pc is the target next year," he added.
Mr Martin said the Government has been able to borrow very cheaply during the pandemic and added that the focus after the Covid-19 crisis will be to reduce that debt.
"We have received different analysis in terms of what would happen ideally in a post-Covid environment," the Taoiseach said.
"You've about €12.5bn in household savings extra this year than you would have had last year and that's quite significant.
"That could be released into the economy over time when people become less cautious and worried about the Covid impact on their own personal lives."
However, Mr Martin warned there might be "areas of revenue generation that cannot be ruled out".
Difficulty
The Taoiseach said the recently established Commission on Pensions may recommend changes to the PRSI system to fund pensions.
"That would be more specific to the social insurance fund or to improvements I mentioned earlier: the living wage or indeed better redundancy mechanisms, for example, for workers that are in difficulty," he said.
"So, you could be looking at a reorganisation of some of your social supports as well, which may necessitate some revenue-generating measures that would be exclusive to that or applicable to that area.
"But that's all to be worked out in terms of recommendations that will come from the pensions commission."
The Programme for Government says tax credits and bands will be indexed linked to earning from Budget 2022 onwards if incomes rise again as the economy recovers.
It will aim to ensure fewer people on low incomes are taken into the tax net and to make sure more people are not paying higher income tax and USC rates.
There were no significant income-tax cuts in the last budget due to the cost of responding to the coronavirus pandemic.
During coalition negotiations, Fine Gael pushed to ensure there was a commitment in the Programme for Government not to increase taxes for workers for the next five years.
The Government has plans to introduce a new auto-enrolment pension system which will see the State match contributions made by workers towards their individual pension fund.
A Commission on Pensions is currently examining a number of issues, including the age at which the State pension is paid to people who have stopped working,
The pension age became a General Election issue after Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, the Green Party and the far left campaigned against a Government commitment to increase the pension age to 67 this year. Fianna Fáil was initially in favour of increasing the age but performed a U-turn during the campaign to say the party would prevent the increase or offer a similar payment to those waiting for the full pension.
Fine Gael is in favour of the increase.
The issue was a sticking point during Programme for Government negotiations between Fianna Fáíl, Fine Gael and the Green Party.
The three parties finally agreed to delay the increase.

Passengers from Britain must give proof of negative test

The ban on flights from Britain is set to end on January 6 and will be replaced by new regulations that will see people fined on the spot for failing to produce a negative laboratory coronavirus test on arrival.
People arriving will still also be asked to restrict their movements for at least five days.
If they receive a negative test after five days, they can move under the existing guidelines.
The new rules are aimed at allowing flights within the Common Travel Area while reducing the risk of the English strain of the virus spreading further in Ireland.
The rules come against a backdrop of increasing concern over the rapid spread of the virus during the Christmas period, which resulted in the Government imposing a third national lockdown.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the new rules will make Britain a "red-plus" country among the EU's international travel zones.
"We're planning to end the travel ban with the UK on January 6 and replace it with a more restrictive set of travel regulations between Britain and Ireland," Mr Coveney said.
"We are anxious to move away from a travel ban, which we don't think is realistic, and there does need to be travel facilitated between Britain and Ireland for lots of reasons."
Punishable
Mr Coveney said he believes other EU countries will follow suit in requiring passengers on flights from Britain to produce negative laboratory test results.
He said he hopes the rules will be in place when the ban on travel ends on January 6.
The new regulations are being drafted across five government departments and are expected to be punishable by on-the-spot fines.
At present, there are no plans to introduce travel restrictions on people arriving from South Africa, where another new strain of the virus has emerged.
There are very few, if any, direct flights between Dublin and South Africa, and there is currently no significant air travel between passengers from both countries.
In a letter to the Government this week, Nphet said people affected by the South African strain have a "higher concentration of the virus in the upper respiratory tract", which may make it more transmissible. Nphet said tests were continuing in relation to the effect the vaccine will have on this strain.
It said the English strain can spread more quickly, but there is no evidence it causes more severe disease.
"Experts are confident coronavirus vaccines will block the new variant, although that has to be confirmed by laboratory experiments that are now under way," Nphet said.

Paul Reid warned of "a massively high level and rapidly growing daily cases" and a "very dangerous level of transmission of the virus".
He added that the worst fears from before Christmas had been realised.
Mr Reid made a "serious" call to the public to take immediate actions, withdraw from plans to meet with family and protect themselves by staying home.
He was speaking on a day when the number of cases of coronavirus hit record levels.
Health officials were notified of 1,718 confirmed cases in one day, which was up from the previous 1,546 cases announced on Tuesday.
There were 13 more deaths and 455 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised yesterday, of which 37 were in ICU.
There had been 60 additional hospitalisations in the space of 24 hours.
Meanwhile, a record 2,143 positive cases of the virus were announced by the Department of Health in the North.
It brings the total number of cases in one day on the island of Ireland to almost 4,000 amid deepening concern about the new strain which spreads far quicker.
Mr Reid said "hospitals are coping" but they will be under increasing pressure in the coming weeks.
It is expected that numbers will surge higher due to increased socialising over Christmas.
Demand
Mr Reid confirmed almost half of new cases seen over the past two weeks are among the 19-44 age group, and that the number of contact tracing calls have risen by 300pc in recent weeks.
The R value, the average number of people someone with coronavirus infects, has been estimated at 1.8.
The HSE's lead for testing and tracing also revealed a 41pc rise in demand for Covid-19 testing, with 63,000 referrals in the past week.
Niamh O'Beirne said they expected to see that number double next week.
Ms O'Beirne said this means that they expect to see swabbing sites around the country "maxing out at their daily capacity for testing".
She estimated that they could be looking at 25,000 tests a day for several days.
The largest number of referrals is coming from the 21-30 age group.
This was followed by the 31-40 age group at 18.5pc of all testing referrals, which had a detection rate of 7.6pc.
There has been an increase of 129pc in the number of contact tracing calls made in the past week, which is expected to rise significantly.

The Government last night confirmed an extension to the school Christmas holidays, with pupils now due back on Monday, January 11 instead of the previous Wednesday.
Michael Gillespie, general secretary of the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI), said that while the union had wanted schools to open as normal after Christmas, that was only ever going to be possible "if it was safe".
"Our members are very anxious, we are in schools and colleges with students from 13 to 18-years-of-age," he said.
"From September to Christmas, we stayed ahead of the curve.
"The advice was showing schools weren't spreading the disease.
"However, we don't know how the new variant will spread in schools.
"We have young adults in schools, and thus the Government is wise to assess schools.
"We got lucky in October with the mid-term break.
"The contact tracing at the time was overwhelmed.
"We looked like we were approaching that same point now, with the numbers all going up.
"The Government is buying time to assess what's going on. We hope they assess the situation based on the rising numbers and the incidence of this new variant and we will, as always, follow the public health advice."
The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) had called for the reopening to be postponed until January 11 at the earliest because of the "alarming increase" in cases.
"We welcome the swift movement by the Government to delay the reopening of our primary and special schools," general secretary John Boyle said.
"As we set out yesterday, the alarming public health data and concerns expressed in respect of the new Covid-19 variation warrant this approach.
Protection
"We will seek to work constructively with the Department of Education and Nphet to ensure our schools reopen next month and have the necessary support and protection to stay open safely."
Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) general secretary Kieran Christie said "serious consideration must be given to whether safety measures were now sufficient, given the emergence of the new strain".
The ASTI has already asked Education Minister Norma Foley to consult with Nphet with regard to the implications of the new variant for schools.
Meanwhile, the principal of Owenabue Educate Together in Cork, Catriona Golden, told how the first closure had created difficulties for pupils.
Having initially worked as a principal in Ennis at the beginning of the pandemic, Ms Golden recalled how the first closure was "extremely challenging" for students.
"I have a good level of faith in Nphet and its recommendations, but if the recommendation is that schools should close for a couple of days, what's being put in place with that so that we're not in the same situation in three or four weeks' time?" she said.
"If the recommendation is that schools should stay open, then what are those enhanced measures to make it safer?"

Temperature checks at gigs, air conditioning units that destroy coronavirus inside venues and the roll-out of the vaccine were all cited by the band members as a way to help events return.
Guitarist Vinny May said they had lost count of the number of live gigs they had to cancel during 2020 as the pandemic swept the globe.
"We had a seven-week European tour we had to cancel, an American tour and an Asian tour for next year which is also cancelled," he said.
"We had well over 100 shows that we've had to postpone or reschedule, so it's had a massive impact on us.
"Live musicians make the majority of our income and money to survive from playing shows, so to have the rug completely pulled from under you, it was pretty scary at the start."
He and wife Carina had their first baby, Vincent, last September, and May was able to spend far more time with him as a result of not being on out the road.
However, he admitted he found suddenly having his touring income taken away very difficult to deal with.
"I suppose it's a good thing that there's the four of us and we're each other's support system because I know I had a few wobbles at the start of it where I was freaking out at the fact that we weren't on the road," May said.
"Having the rest of the lads to talk to about it means a problem shared is a problem halved.
"It's hit the whole industry globally, it's the only thing that has universally hit everybody.
"No matter who you are, you've been hit by this. It's a tough one."
Blind
Band frontman Steve Garrigan said they have "booked a lot of shows" for 2021 with the hope of them going ahead.
"I think the promoters around the world are kind of running blind," he said.
"They're just going, 'Let's just put the concerts out there, put them on and just hope for the best'.
"So that's the attitude we have as well."

Mr O'Dea, who was a long-time welfare spokes- man, said the Programme for Government guaran-tees to protect those dependent on social welfare payments from losing buying power due to inflation.
He said that while the overall inflation remains low, a study by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice showed basic items, which take up most of poorer people's incomes, increased by 6pc over the past two years.
"In the last two years, welfare has not been increased but incomes in Ireland since 2016 have increased by an average of 16pc," Mr O'Dea said.
"Even with this Brexit deal, customs clearance and handling charges will drive up grocery and other prices.
"The Brexit fallout compounds the need to review basic welfare rates.
"The reality is that the increases in basic house- hold items could be any- thing up to double that rate of increase over the past two years."
Hardship
Mr O'Dea said he welcomed the Government's Covid-19 payments, which included many innovative elements.
He said that without these there would be widespread hardship "on a serious scale2.
"But I have already expressed my disappointment at no welfare rate increases over the past two years," the Limerick City TD said.
"Page 85 of the Programme for Government guarantees to protect our most vulnerable people against the consequences of inflation, but we are simply not doing that."
Government figures for the cost of Covid-19 payments at the end of November showed that up to €100m a week was being paid out, making early welfare rate increases unlikely.

Extra bank holiday as a 'thank you' for efforts

Taoiseach Micheál Martin said there was "potential" for Ireland to get an additional bank holiday next year.
The idea was first floated by Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris.
Challenges
Mr Harris said he was open to the idea, as most of the bank holiday weekends were affected by Covid-19 restrictions.
The proposal was mooted as a way to address the huge challenges facing the tourism and hospitality industry.
Asked if the Government will consider introducing an additional bank holiday, Mr Martin said: "I think that is one potential, yes, that we could do in terms of reflecting and acknowledging the work of many workers in different fields and in different sectors.
"We'll be considering it."
The Taoiseach did not reveal any further details about the proposal, nor what month the Government would look at for introducing the extra holiday.
Mr Harris said it could be a way of marking the sacrifices people have made since the outbreak of coronavirus.
He previously said: "Yeah, I think when the country gets through this and it's safe to begin to do some normal things again, I think there would be some benefit in having a day to recognise all that people have been through and sacrificed, that people might be able to enjoy with their family and friends."
Standstill
Coronavirus restrictions forced thousands of holidaymakers to cancel trips abroad, with many families staying in Ireland.
The country's tourism bodies encouraged people to take a staycation as overseas travel came to a standstill.
Tourism Ireland is expected to launch a huge marketing campaign to promote the country to foreign visitors again.

HSE limits one close contact Covid test

Usually, the HSE offers two coronavirus tests to close contacts between day zero and day seven.
However, to deal with increased demands on testing and contact tracing systems, only one is being offered by the HSE on day five.
This will be reviewed on January 12.
Close contacts of confirmed cases should still restrict their movements for 14 days, even if their test is negative.
Speaking last week, HSE CEO Paul Reid said that if cases reached 2,000 a day, there would be "major pressure on our testing and tracing capacity" as well as "very significant hospitalisation" and "very significant ICU increases".
Positive cases can now also register their contacts online.
"So, right now we can, if you're a close contact you'll be alerted where you can register your close contacts online rather than us having to make contact," Mr Reid said.
Pressure
"But those contacts can then arrange their own appointment for swabbing, so rather than us ringing.
"So, that takes relief off the call pressure."
Mr Reid said referrals and symptomatic people will be prioritised.
"And also, what we will be, as required, moving to because we have to prioritise symptomatic people and referrals," he added.
"We will be prioritising and probably most likely moving to a single-day test.
"So, instead of a day zero and a day seven, we'll maximise the capacity and go for a single-day test.
"So, a number of contingency measures were put in place and operational measures."
There are now 750 full- time contact tracers and 630 full-time contact swabbers working, with scheduling arranged throughout the festive period.
Mr Reid said personnel may also be pulled from other areas, such as the Defence Forces.
"We'll also pull on some other contingency workforce. So, people like the Defence Forces who have been working with us in the past will be deployed at the right points in time," he added.
"We're also doing things like system solutions."

Plans for what the reality of the first few days of imports and exports may bring were outlined by Customs, An Garda Síochána and the Departments of Transport and Agriculture yesterday at Dublin Port.
While each agency has its own concerns, the word "delays" was common to them all.
Sophisticated steps have been taken to try to make the post-Brexit transition as streamlined as possible.
Problems
It is clear it will not be only truck drivers and freight carriers who will face potential traffic problems, but the wider public too.
Eddie Burke of the Department of Transport laid out the four-stage plan that will come into effect if traffic in Dublin Port stretches to the public road network, particularly at the M1, M50 and Port Tunnel.
A green level is when traffic is moving freely, and the response is graduated through amber, red and blue levels.
A Code Blue, the worst case scenario, would mean the port being closed.
"The plans are there to deal with each of those levels and prepare for the next one if the situation worsens," Mr Burke said.
"If a situation is worsening, we will be holding traffic back from coming into the port, and that will be done on the M50/M1 loop, effectively making that a truck park and diverting other traffic away from there to get to the city."
The blue car park at Dublin Airport will also be used as an overflow truck park, along with capacity at the service station in Lusk.
A smaller number of bays at Enfield and Kilcullen will also be used for port traffic travelling toward Dublin from the west of the city.

Almost half (46pc) of the audience came from overseas after all productions were cancelled on March 11.
On average, 122,820 people attend a show annually, but this year the figure fell to just 18,728.
However, the audience took to virtual means to view some of their favourite productions and 324,490 tuned in to watch shows online over the course of the year.
A third of the audience watched from the UK and 6.3pc from the United States.
Viewers from Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Spain and New Zealand were also recorded.
Graham McLaren and Neil Murray, directors of the Abbey Theatre, said that this year gave the theatre a chance to experiment.
"We worked around the restrictions, seeing this as an opportunity to innovate and experiment with form - to create an extraordinary programme for an extraordinary year," they said.
Possibilities
"Our work on this programme required the development of new technologies and practices which will allow us to confidently continue to engage audiences in 2021, no matter what the restriction might be."
They said that theatre has now been "changed forever".
"This year may have changed theatre forever, certainly opening our eyes to possibilities of providing greater access to our work," they said.
"This is an important consideration for a national theatre if we are to be truly 'national'."
Virtual performances included an immersive site-specific production of Patrick Kavanagh's poem The Great Hunger in the grounds of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, a Zoom adaptation of the award-winning play This Beautiful Village and an online trilogy entitled Dear Ireland.
Over Christmas, the Abbey Calling initiative saw 50 actors plugging in to the Abbey switchboard to read a poem or song and connect to a member of the audience at home or abroad in partnership with Aware.
In 2020, the Abbey employed 600 freelancers for online performances, with an additional 90 staff employed by partners through co-production, as well as a limited number of in-person performances.

Stick kettle on - how five cups a day keeps elderly brain healthy

Pensioners who drink more than five cups a day have been found to have better brain function than their counterparts who do not, researchers have said.
In a study of 676 people aged over 85, tea drinkers who enjoyed more than five mugs a day were shown to have more focus and a sustained attention span.
The Newcastle University research also found they demonstrated better psychomotor skills which link brain and movement.
Tea drinkers showed better accuracy and speed of reaction.
These skills could help in daily activities such as driving, sewing and finishing a jigsaw.
Previous research showed tea has health benefits, including lowering blood pressure and cholesterol and may even aid weight loss.
"We now know that enjoying a cup of tea quenches your thirst and has benefits for over-85s' attention span," said Dr Edward Okello, from Newcastle University's Human Nutrition Research Centre.
Milk
Researchers studied the tea- drinking habits of those aged over 85 and living in their own homes or in assisted accommodation and found those who drank more than five cups of tea a day - with or without milk - performed better cognitively.
They used data from the flagship Newcastle 85+ study involving more than 1,000 people aged over 85 from Newcastle and North Tyneside.
Started in 2006, studies are still continuing, with around 200 participants as they be- come centenarians.
Research nurses gather information by visiting participants in their own homes to complete a health assessment made up of questionnaires, measurements, function tests and a fasting blood test.
Examining the consumption of black tea, Camellia sinensis, the researchers were looking for evidence that it protected against cognitive decline.
They found that higher tea consumption was associated with significantly better attention skills and psychomotor speed on complex tasks.
However, they found no association between tea consumption and overall measures of memory or performance on simple speed tasks.
The results have been published in BMC Nutrition.
The researchers suggest the findings mean black tea should be considered for the very old in any diet.
However, Dr Okello said he could not be sure if it was the drink or the routine of making it that made the difference.
"The skills we see maintained in this group may not only be due to the compounds present in tea, but it may also be the rituals of making a pot of tea or sharing a chat over a cup of tea which are just as important," he said.
Another study has shown that drinking three cups of tea every day could slash the risk of Alzheimer's by more than a third.
Researchers in the US identified a link between protection from the degenerative disease and flavonols found in tea.

"I was told that the music in the background of that strange announcement - was me - singing Downtown!" she wrote in a Facebook post.
"Of all the thousands of songs - why this one?"
Killed
The 88-year-old singer said she loved Nashville and wished she could give everyone in the city a hug.
The explosion happened in the heart of Nashville's historic city centre.
It killed the bomber, injured several people and damaged dozens of buildings.
The RV blared a warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes then switched to a recording of Downtown before the blast.
"Millions of people all over the world have been uplifted by this joyful song," Clark wrote.
"Perhaps you can read something else into these words - depending on your state of mind. It's possible."

'Figures through the roof' - Level 5 lockdown looms before new year

The Government is likely to close all non-essential shops and services, reintroduce 5km restrictions, and to extend the UK travel ban.
People may be asked to leave their home only for exercise or essential purposes, although one minister insisted that the prolonged closure of schools had not been considered.
Gyms and other fitness facilities are likely to close.
Meanwhile, full PCR testing of all arriving passengers is likely to be established at ports and airports - even though the land border with the North remains open.
"People have not been following the rules, and the figures are through the roof," said a Government source last night.
A record 1,546 were confirmed Covid-19 cases yesterday, the Department of Health said. This brings the total number of cases in the Republic so far to 88,439.
There were also a further nine deaths, bringing the total number to 2,213.
Last night, the Department of Public Health urged people in one of the country's worst-hit regions to "avoid large social gatherings of any kind for New Year's celebrations".
There have been 800 positive coronavirus cases in Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary combined over the past two weeks, the Department of Health Mid West said.
Monitor
"We know that the virus has been widely circulating for nearly four weeks in the community, and spreading through these extended social gatherings in the lead up to Christmas.
"However, while we continue to closely monitor the possible impact of Christmas celebrations, we fear that large household gatherings in recent days may have added an extra layer to what is already a complex situation locally," said Dr Mai Mannix, Director of Public Health Mid-West.
An emergency Cabinet meeting has been called for today to discuss the worsening Covid-19 situation.
Ministers and health officials are doubly concerned that a third wave could peak in mid-January when the healthcare system is traditionally under most pressure.
They are also aware that the fall-out from socialising over the Christmas period has yet to play out in the data.
"There have been parties everywhere although obviously the majority of the population is trying to help control the ­situation," said a source.
"But the figures we are seeing now, while sky high, are from 10 days ago.
"We haven't seen the Christmas figures yet, and we can expect them to be very bad. So the situation is going to get worse before it gets better."
Higher Education Minister Simon Harris warned that New Year's Eve parties must be a 'complete no-no' this year.
"The Government will decide whether to update its decisions, but the advice of the Chief Medical Officer is good enough for me. He has said to us across the last number of days. Please, please reduce your social contacts, and please try and stay at home," he said.
Funerals
He added it was also "inadvisable" to gather with others outside to see in the new year. "I'm not a doctor, but my very clear understanding of this virus is that the more you congregate with people, the more likely it is to spread," Mr Harris said.
"Our CMO is very concerned about the spread of this virus. I want everyone in this country to have a chance to get the vaccine. And I don't want to be going to the funerals of loved ones in the months of January and February."
Ireland is about to enter a difficult period because of the British variant of the virus, even though vaccinations have begun, he added.
He said he would not be surprised to see 2,000 new daily infections in Ireland before the new year, as predicted before Christmas.
Ministers will now consider a recommendation from Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan that the toughest measures from last March and April be re-instigated.
The extra controls will be reviewed in tandem with those already planned from December 31 until January 12 next.
But the Government could also signal that it will be in place for an extended level of time, possibly until St Valentine's Day.
Ministers want to buy enough time to get the vaccine rolled out after the first inoculation yesterday.
One predicted the tight restrictions due to come into effect on January 1 would be brought forward by a day to prevent household revelries to mark the new year.
"I think the main issues are whether it all kicks in on the 31st, or on the first, and how long it should all go on for," the minister said.
"No more yo-yo might be best, staying in Level 5 until the most vulnerable in our society receive their vaccines.
"The Government recognises that it will be really hard on people. Jobs will be lost, and it is a dark and depressing time."
Another source said a longer clampdown would be needed to have a hope of containing the explosion of cases since the easing of restrictions on December 1. The travel ban to the UK is to be extended by a week, such is the threat posed by the highly contagious new strain of the virus.
"The best way of guarding against that British variant may be by extending restrictions," admitted Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien.
But Mr O'Brien said that schools will open in January, and that the issue has not been discussed by the Cabinet.

'I loved reaction to our accents,' says Dornan

Dornan, who is from Holywood, Co Down, and Blunt, from London, play star-crossed lovers in the romantic drama set in rural Ireland.
However, their accents in the trailer, which was released last month, prompted mockery from some Irish viewers, with Dublin Airport's official Twitter feed calling for the "accent police".
Speaking on The Graham Norton Show's New Year's Eve special, the 50 Shades Of Grey star said the response was typical of Irish humour.
"I thought the reaction was funny. I'm from Ireland and our currency is taking the piss, so it's rare to put something out there and not have the piss taken. I'm all for it," said Dornan (38).
The film, written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, also stars Jon Hamm and Christopher Walken and tells a love story set against the landscapes of rural Ireland.
Dornan and Blunt play lovers Anthony and Rosemary, whose families are caught up in a feud over a hotly-contested patch of land that separates their two farms.
"John Patrick Shanley has a kookiness to his work. His are not normal linear movies, they're all a bit heightened and a bit odd, but the words are beautiful," Dornan said of the script.
Blunt (37) also praised the writing, adding: "When we read the script, we thought it was so bewitching and completely unique.
"It's odd, lyrical and romantic, so we're just excited for people to see it because it's so uplifting and it certainly sweeps you away to a magical world. It's a joy."
Dornan, who has three daughters with wife Amelia Warner, said his children had helped him through lock- down.
Trauma
"If you have kids, it can make it a lot harder in many respects but also save you in many ways," he said.
"They take your mind off the daily trauma while living through a pandemic.
"They would dress me up and I'm all for that - particularly putting on a dress."

The Stars Wars actress (28) appears alongside Spider-Man star Tom Holland (24) in Doug Liman's big-screen adaptation of author Patrick Ness's dystopian young adult novel series.
Disappeared
The feature, which is slated for release next year, follows Todd Hewitt (Holland) as he discovers Viola (Ridley), a mysterious girl who crash lands on his planet, where all the women have disappeared.
Ridley recalled receiving the comment one day while she was having her char- acter's blonde wig fitted.
She also revealed one director she previously worked with had told her that her energy was "quite aggressive".
"I've been told I'm intimidating," Ridley told Tatler.
"That was on Chaos Walking. I was having my hair done, having my wig put on. I remember thinking, 'God, should I be smaller? Should I be quieter?'
"I've been called aggressive, too. My energy is 'quite aggressive'. That was during a meeting with a director.
"I was thinking, 'But why? Is it because I maintained eye contact? Is it because I'm passionate about what we're talking about?' I dunno.
"You have that horrible feeling of, 'Do I not come across the way I think I do?'"
The actress, who appears on the cover of Tatler's February issue, also said the effects of shooting to fame following the release of 2015's The Force Awakens were "challenging".

Ms McNiffe, of Ardclough, Straffan, said her son Jack (15), who has Down syndrome, is waiting for an MRI scan.
"The waiting list in Ireland to see a paediatric rheumatologist is four years. It was three years pre-Covid-19," she said.
"We have only two of these specialists serving the entire country. We should have at least six in a country this size.
"A private appointment is a wait of up to two years.
"This is particularly detrimental to children with Down Syndrome."
Ms McNiffe said Jack has a rare auto-inflammatory disease and chronic arthritis.
"He is under the care of paediatric rheumatology in Crumlin Children's Hospital since he was one year of age.
Surgery
"He is under 13 medical teams in total as he has complex medical issues, sometimes more depending on what's going on at the time. He needs 24-hour care.
"He is a wheelchair user, he is tube-fed around the clock and he is non-verbal.
"He has a severe intellectual disability.
"He has a heart condition which requires further surgery, he has chronic lung disease which means he has frequent chest infections. Despite all, he is a happy chap."
Ms McNiffe said they were waiting for an MRI scan to see how the latest biologic drug for Jack was working.
"That was due in November just gone. Hopefully, he will have it in early 2021," she said.
Children's Hospital Ireland, in a recent response to James Lawless TD, said there was an active recruitment campaign for an additional rheumatology consultant.

Vaccine is our 'path to freedom', says doc who received it

However, Prof John Gallagher warned that despite the fact thousands will receive the vaccine over the coming weeks, it does not mean Ireland can relax critical social distancing measures, given the scale of the third wave of virus cases currently being experienced.
Prof Gallagher, a Cork-based occupational health consultant, warned that Ireland is in the grip of a major third wave of the Covid-19 virus with case numbers soaring.
Frontline
He received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at Cork University Hospital (CUH) alongside other frontline healthcare workers.
Around 500 frontline staff will receive the jab at CUH over the next 72 hours, with 15 in the first vaccination phase yesterday, which followed intensive training for the teams administering the jab.
Those who received the vaccine included doctors, nurses, porters, receptionists and strategic hospital support workers.
Prof Gallagher said the vaccine roll-out represented a turning point in the battle against Covid-19, but warned the war was not yet over.
"It's a great day for us. We were doing about 10 to 15 people today to help the vaccinators get up and running," he said.
"The next few days will then be very busy. I had my arm out for the first dose and was looking forward to it.
"It's a very big day for us, but we're in a very strange period.
"I remember vividly being in this department last March when we had the first surge. It was like a tidal wave of cases in March and quite overwhelming.
"We got through that, and the October one came along quite suddenly.
"We learned some lessons and we muscled through. You could see this third wave happening with all the interest in the Christmas period, travel and the rest.
"Boy, are we now stuck in that third wave.
Anxiety
"Numbers are pushing up, there's a lot of anxiety around the place but, for the first time and in contrast to the other waves, now we can point people in the right direction.
"We have a way out. As far as I'm concerned, this is the 'pathway to freedom' as regards to getting away from Covid-19.
"But we must not forget this is a really big wave of cases that's upon us at the moment.
"We're not going to see the peak for another couple of weeks.
"Even with the vaccination programme, we cannot afford to drop our guard with wearing masks, social distancing and reducing contacts."

Vitamin D cuts risk of death from virus

Scientists from the country's leading universities outline compelling evidence to revise guidance on vitamin D supplementation during the pandemic in a call to action paper published in the Irish Journal of Medical Science.
Urging
Dr Declan Gerard Byrne, a clinician at St James's Hospital, and Professor Rose Anne Kenny, principal investigator of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), are among those urging health professionals and policy-makers to recognise the importance of enhanced vitamin D in immune response.
Dr Dan McCartney, programme director of Human Nutrition and Dietetics at TU Dublin and Trinity College Dublin, said "the accumulation of evidence linking low vitamin D levels and Covid-19 is now considerable".
"This evidence includes studies which show an increased risk of infection in those with low vitamin D levels and a 25 to 30-fold reduced risk of ICU admission and a substantial reduction risk of death in older Covid-19 patients supplemented with vitamin D," he said.
"The current pandemic has claimed over 2,000 lives in this country and continues to pressurise our acute care system."
He advises people to take 20 to 25 micrograms of vitamin D each day for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis.
However, Dr McCartney said older people and those who are obese or with darker skin may need to take a higher dose of the vitamin in consultation with their GP.
"Over the last few months, clinical studies in hospital patients with Covid-19 began to show people who were vitamin D deficient did much worse in their clinical outcome," he told LMFM.

Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (2.3 million doses)
This is being administered from today.
The first shipment of 10,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine arrived in Ireland on Saturday.
An additional 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine are due for delivery next week, with 40,000 doses due each week through January and into February.
Moderna vaccine (875,000 doses)
The EU has ordered a further 80 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and brought forward plans to assess the shot for approval in Europe.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to issue its verdict on conditional marketing authorisation on January 6.
HSE boss Paul Reid said the State was "in dialogue" with Moderna regarding its delivery schedule and roll-out.
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (3.3 million doses)
The UK plans to roll this out from January 4.
However, Ireland may have to wait a while longer.
An EMA official said yesterday it was unlikely that the vaccine would be recommended for approval by the EMA next month.
The agency's deputy executive director, Noel Wathion, said the EMA does not have enough information about the vaccine.
"At the moment, AstraZeneca has only provided data on their clinical trials to the European Medicines Agency," he said.
More like a standard vaccine, it will be considerably easier to administer as it does not require very cold storage as is the case with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna jabs, which are new mRNA vaccines.
Janssen vaccine (2.2 million doses)
It is expected that approval for the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is currently in phase three clinical trials involving 45,000 people, will be sought in the first half of 2021.
Sanofi vaccine (3.3 million doses)
Two weeks ago, Sanofi announced that its Covid-19 vaccines will not be ready until the end of 2021, after interim results showed a low immune response in older adults.
CureVac vaccine (no details on order yet)
German biotech group CureVac launched its final-stage trial earlier this month.
The company, which uses a similar mRNA platform to vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and US rival Moderna, is unlikely to apply for regulatory approval until the middle of next year.

Years before hidden harm of Covid may come to light

The battles against heart disease, cancer and a range of serious illnesses have suffered during the country's unprecedented war against the virus.
There is a worrying toll of delayed diagnoses, missed appointments, backlogs of waiting lists as well as a slow- down in clinics due to infection control measures, particularly in the early part of the pandemic.
"We won't have the full picture for a number of years," GP Dr Denis McCauley said.
"If you had a heart attack and were not treated in time, you could have suffered heart damage."
The effects on more severe illness and death among many people who were not seen quickly enough will take time to show, the GP spokesman for the Irish Medical Organisation said.
Cardiologist Dr Angie Brown said heart and stroke patients are more vulnerable, suffering from a higher morbidity and mortality.
"This has meant our patients have been reluctant to attend the emergency department, so often symptoms of chest pain, breathlessness or transient weakness have been played down or ignored.
"In the initial stages of the pandemic, this resulted in fewer patients attending with heart attacks and strokes.
"So for some patients, when they do come to hospital, they are much sicker and some have missed the opportunity to receive life-saving treatment, leading to an increase in preventable death and disability."
To cope with the potential Covid-19 surge earlier this year, all non-essential services were cancelled or curtailed.
"The extent to which this may have caused an excess of deaths remains unclear, but undoubtedly the ongoing backlog of cases for proced- ures such as angiograms, angioplasties and coronary artery bypass graft surgeries will be associated with an ongoing risk of harm," said Dr Brown, the medical director of the Irish Heart Foundation.
Necessary
"Many out-patient services have also been curtailed, so patients haven't had their very necessary reviews."
A survey carried out by the Irish Thoracic Society shows the majority of respiratory consultants in the Republic and the North said waiting lists for routine care have soared since the outbreak of Covid-19.
The number of people waiting to see a respiratory consultant has jumped to more than 21,000 - an increase of 7pc compared with figures at the start of the pandemic.
Dr Aidan O'Brien, a respiratory physician and president of the society, said the legacy of suspending diagnostic and treatment services will be felt for years to come.
Dublin respiratory consult- ant Dr Marcus Butler revealed that "with the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the many regrettable outcomes is that I am seeing some patients with lung cancer whom I would normally have seen much, much sooner.
"Unfortunately, with a disease like lung cancer it is a very time-sensitive condition, so any time lag can significantly limit the types of interventions we can make, which is hugely distressing for patients and their families."
He said his own waiting list "has increased by well over six months".

Health Minister Salvador Illa said vaccination was voluntary and there would be no consequences for those who refuse to take the shots.
Although he added that the information would be shared with Spain's EU colleagues.
"We will have a registry... of those people who have been offered [the vaccine] and have simply rejected it," Mr Illa told Spain's La Sexta TV channel.
"It is not a document that will be made public and it will be done with the utmost respect for data protection."
Mr Illa said registering people's rejection of the jabs would avoid confusion over why certain individuals had not been vaccinated when it was their turn.
Spain started administering the Pfizer vaccine on Sunday.
Deploy
A poll from early December on people's willingness to be vaccinated carried out by the state CIS research body showed 28pc of Spaniards said they would refuse the shots, down from more than 40pc in September.
Spain's health ministry plans to deploy an average of 350,000 shots of the Pfizer vaccine per week over the next three months.
The country's official number of deaths from Covid-19 has now topped 50,000.

'It won't bring her back but it will help others' - mum of Nicole as 'Coco's law' passed

Nicole Fox, whose nickname was Coco, was 21 when she died in January 2018.
Her mother, Jackie Fox, of Clondalkin, and her family have been campaigning for a change to the law ever since.
Abuse
Yesterday, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 was formally signed into law by President Michael D Higgins following months of debate.
It outlaws a wide range of offences including online abuse, cyber-bullying and image-based abuse.
Justice Minister Helen McEntee said it was not possible to legally change the title of the bill to Coco's Law in memory of Nicole, but the legislation her mother successfully campaigned for will always be known by that name.
"It's a bittersweet day. It won't bring Nicole back, but it will help others. My emotions are all over the place," Ms Fox said.
"I feel proud, guilty, happy and sad. I don't know what the right feeling is.
"I remember sitting on Nicole's bed once a few weeks after she died, and I was inches away from joining her.
"But I decided to go into survival mode and be persistent in getting the law changed to make this type of bullying an offence."
Under the new bill, if there is "intent to cause harm", the offence carries an unlimited fine or a prison sentence of up to seven years.
If there is no intent to cause harm, the same offence will be punishable by a maximum penalty of €5,000 or 12 months' imprisonment.
It bill was passed after a petition with more than 32,000 signatures was presented to the Dáil last September.
It urged TDs to make online abuse a criminal offence.
The bill was drafted by Labour's justice spokesperson Brendan Howlin, who said the current laws on online abuse were outdated.
"The last time we updated these types of laws was when texting came in 30 years ago," he said in a statement when he re-introduced the bill.
"The whole online world has exploded, and we as a country did nothing to police it.
Platforms
"I first introduced this bill more than three years and, unfortunately, we did not make the progress we wanted with the previous minister for justice."
The bill encompasses all forms of electronic communication - both written and spoken - and includes messaging on apps such as WhatsApp as well as posts on social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram.
It received widespread support in the community.
Along with the petition, a socially-distanced march was held in August in which supporters, many of whom had also experienced online abuse, demanded that the bill become law.

The former British prime minister said the people had been failed by the government in London in their hour of need during a disaster which reached its nadir in 1847.
British government archives from 1997 were released by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI).
A restricted letter from Donald Lamont, an official in the British government's Republic of Ireland affairs section, dated June 2 1997, discussed Mr Blair's statement that month on the Famine.
It said: "I do not think I could have wished for a better response to the Prime Minister's statement than that of the Taoiseach (John Bruton) reported in your telegram number 178.
"The Irish Embassy have also been warm in their reaction.
"And if (Ulster Unionist) John Taylor is no more than 'dismissive' then no harm may have been done in that quarter."
The 1845-50 disaster was prompted by a potato blight that made Ireland's staple crop inedible.
Pain
It caused an estimated one million deaths and forced two million starving and destitute Irish to emigrate.
Mr Blair had acknowledged the fact that "one million people should have died in what was then part of the richest, most powerful nation in the world is something that still causes pain".
His statement was read out during a Famine commemoration in Millstreet, Co Cork.
Mr Lamont wrote afterwards: "The most obvious downside would be attempts by the Irish to exaggerate the potential parallel with Bloody Sunday.
"The situations seem to me so different that that ought not to be too difficult to handle."

25,000 new homes by the end of 2021, promises Martin

Mr Martin said the Government's target is a "challenging" figure.
Around 12,750 will be social homes. Of those, 9,750 will be direct builds by approved housing bodies or local authorities.
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a big impact on this year's target, with around 18,000 new homes expected to be completed by the end of this month.
Mr Martin said that while the number of homeless people has dropped since March, the Government is giving "everything we can".
Deliver
"We have pledged around €3.3bn for housing in 2021. The key issue will be capacity to deliver to get the houses built," he said.
"Covid has impacted in the first wave because in the first lockdown, construction shut down and that has impacted housebuilding."
Mr Martin said the Land and Development Agency Bill was approved by the Cabinet, which now puts the LDA on a statutory footing.
"That's a significant milestone. It is another weapon in our armoury," he added.
"The Housing Affordability plan also came through Cabinet, so the minister has been very active.
"There are very challenging issues in the context of both pieces of legislation.
"They will come into the Dáil and the Oireachtas in the new session.
"From July, we talked about voids, and through the July Stimulus we took 40 or 50 million euro to get 2,500 voids - houses in disrepair under local authorities - and get them done and we did.
"By the end of the year, the majority of those will be done.
"There's an energy come to this, and every morning when I wake up I say, 'What are my key priorities? Housing, health, climate change in addition to Covid and the education'."
The Taoiseach said the challenge will be post-Covid-19.
"There will be an impact in the lifetime of this Government," he added.
The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) said 33,000 units every year are needed to keep up with the population.
"My worry is about getting to the 33,000 figure which the ESRI has said is necessary to put a dent into the waiting times," Mr Martin said.
"I'm not happy yet that we are where we should be and I think we'll keep driving it on.
"On homelessness, I think numbers are coming down, but we want to keep that down. Six thousand people exited homelessness last year.
"So we want to concentrate on getting more people out of homelessness."

But there is growing concern in Government at what is expected to be a jump in Covid-19 cases which could hit around 2,000 a day by New Year's Eve.
The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) last week recommended the country enter a full Level 5 lockdown which would involve the closure of clothes shops, other non-essential retailers and gyms as well as bringing back the 5km travel limit.
But while there was a discussion at Cabinet about the worsening Covid-19 situation and today's start to the roll-out of the vaccine, there will be no tightening of restrictions for now.
Retailers who have been allowed to stay open - albeit with instructions not to hold the usual January sales - will breathe a sigh of relief.
Worrying
But the current restrictions are being kept under review amid the continued worrying spread of the disease.
A source last night said the Cabinet didn't discuss any new restrictions but the Government continues to monitor the situation.
Infections are set to spiral in the coming days as more people are tested for the virus after Christmas.
But there is also an expectation there will be a fall again in early January as the impact of the closure of restaurants and pubs from Christmas Eve onwards and the renewed restrictions on inter-county travel from St Stephen's Day take effect.
All visits to people's homes aside from essential care purposes are to stop again from New Year's Day and are currently restricted to people from just one other household.
The vaccine roll-out - which begins with the Pfizer/BioNTech drug in a small number of hospitals today - was discussed by ministers last night.
Nursing home residents, who are being prioritised for the vaccine, will start to get the injections from January 4 as the roll-out begins in large healthcare settings and some long-term care facilities.
Restrictions
In recent days Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has floated the idea of keeping the current level of restrictions until vulnerable people and healthcare workers are vaccinated.
And he renewed the suggestion yesterday, telling RTÉ: "If restrictions are going to be in place for a prolonged period, not a few weeks but maybe a few months, they need to be ones that are sustainable."
Mr Varadkar was asked whether the Government will consider closing non-essential shops as has been done in the North where cases continue to surge.
The Enterprise Minister said modelling shows that the opening of non-essential retail and the lifting of the 5km limit at the start of December - and previously in the pandemic - "didn't have a major effect on the numbers". Given this, the Government had to consider if closing shops is worth all the other consequences.
The Tánaiste said the intention remains for schools to open as planned.

Climate change a massive threat to our humble spuds

Droughts will mean it will be increasingly difficult to grow potatoes in the south and east of the country, while the north and west suffer from more severe winter deluges of rain.
These are among the "real" impacts that will occur before the longer-term threat to Ireland's major cities from sea-level rise due to the melting of polar ice-caps, if climate change isn't halted, Mr Ryan has said.
The Programme for Government sets out an ambitious 7pc-a-year target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade and the aim of having net zero by 2050.
The inclusion of the goal was one of the key demands of the Green Party before it entered coalition.
Mr Ryan has said one of his priorities in the next six months is to set out a "really ambitious climate action plan".
At a round-table interview with journalists, he was asked to put in real terms what climate change will mean for people in Ireland.
He said the south-east is most at risk from rising sea levels, adding that the threat to the Dublin-Rosslare rail line, which runs along the coast, is a "practical example of it".
Mr Ryan stated that even sections of the line in Dublin Bay are at risk. He said that Dún Laoghaire Harbour and the Dart station at Salthill have been "getting a battering".
He said the protection of the rail line will require "significant intervention", and added that it's "not a small engineering issue and not easy to resolve".
Mr Ryan also pointed to the work of one of Ireland's top climate-change scientists, Prof
John Sweeney, in outlining other tangible impacts at a local level in Ireland.
"The analysis he's done shows, in general, that we're going to see much wetter winters in the north and west of the country and drier summers in the south and east."
Mr Ryan said he always tells farming organisations that "the climate itself is going to change Irish farming".
He said the drought of 2018 was "very severe" and "the grass-based system that we have in the south-east was under huge stress. That would force us to change".
He also warned: "It would force us to change. For example, the growing of potatoes will become increasingly difficult in the south and east unless there is irrigated land."
He said the north and west are "already harsher or difficult environments because of the levels of rainfall - those increased rainfall events in the winter - and particularly the intense rainfall events, that's very real."
Targets
Mr Ryan added: "This is not an academic or long-term problem. This is something we're already facing here now. They're the big adaptations."
He said the climate is "going to require us to change".
The Green Party leader said the long-term effect of climate change is why he is so adamant that the targets in the Paris Agreement must be met.
He said there are "tipping points" like the impact of the Arctic ice melt in terms of accelerating the heating of the planet.
"The risk is that if we go beyond a certain point, it then becomes an irreversible process."

Neil McDonnell (52) took the 13 phones from a loading bay and put them into a van he was driving on the day, a court heard.
He pleaded guilty to theft when he appeared at Blanchardstown District Court and was remanded on continuing bail to February.
McDonnell, with an address at Limekiln Road, Greenhills, was charged with stealing the 13 iPhone 11s at Securispeed, Ninth Lock Road, Clondalkin, last February 13.
Garda Sergeant Maria Callaghan told Judge David McHugh the DPP had consented to the case being dealt with summarily in the district court on a guilty plea only.
The judge asked her to outline the prosecution's case so he could consider jurisdiction.
Sgt Callaghan said gardaí received a report on February 17 that there had been an alleged theft at the premises some days earlier.
Footage
CCTV footage was viewed and McDonnell, who was a staff member, could be seen taking a box containing iPhone 11s from a loading bay.
The phones had a combined value of €11,202, the court heard.
McDonnell placed the box in a van he was driving on the day, Sgt Callaghan said.
Gardaí investigated and Mc- Donnell then went to a garda station.
Judge McHugh said he would accept jurisdiction to deal with the case.
This means it can be heard in the district court instead of being sent for trial to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.
McDonnell was offering a plea of guilty, but asked the judge not to "dispose of it now", his barrister said.
The accused had attended treatment for a gambling addiction.
Seeking an adjournment, the barrister said the issue of compensation might be relevant.
The judge put the case back to a date in February.

Monk's nephew sues after board refuses to pay cost of his prison legal battle

Derek 'Del Boy' Hutch issued the proceedings against the board and the State after his costs were not met in a 2017 case he took against the governor of Wheatfield Prison.
In that action he challenged his enforced segregation from the general prison population.
At the time, it was reported he had been moved into a special protection wing of the prison following the murder of his uncle, Eddie Hutch Sr, during the deadly Hutch-Kinahan gangland feud.
Threat
He was considered to have been under threat from the Kinahan cartel.
His brother Gary was shot dead by that mob in 2015.
However, Hutch maintained his segregation hindered his chances of reducing his time in jail, as participation in "structured activities" is part of the criteria that must be met for an application for enhanced remission.
He also claimed he was restricted to the extent where he was denied access to facilities and rehabilitation programmes.
The 35-year-old is currently serving a lengthy sentence for his part in the attempted robbery of a cash-in-transit van.
In his High Court judicial review proceedings, Hutch is seeking an order quashing a decision by the Legal Aid Board not to meet his costs under its custody issues scheme.
He is also seeking a declaration that the board should have followed a recommendation made by Mr Justice Paul McDermott in July 2018 that his legal costs be met under that scheme.
Hutch's challenge to the Legal Aid Board decision is due to be mentioned before the court in late January.
His 2017 proceedings against the prison governor were not successful.
However, according to a legal filing made on Hutch's behalf, Mr Justice McDermott made a recommendation that his legal costs be paid under the custody issues scheme.
The scheme covers proceedings in the High Court and the Supreme Court for certain types of cases not covered by the main criminal legal aid scheme.
These include habeas corpus applications and certain types of judicial review.
However, according to the filing, the Legal Aid Board found his judicial review proceedings against the prison governor did not fall within the parameters of the scheme.
The costs involved could be sizeable as the case was mentioned before the High Court on six occasions before a full hearing took place.
The Legal Aid Board has yet to file opposition papers.
Hutch was jailed in 2011 for 10 years, with the final four suspended, for the manslaughter of a man following a house party in Co Meath four years before.

FBI experts matched DNA samples recovered from the scene to that of Anthony Q Warner, whose home in nearby Antioch was searched on Saturday by federal agents.
"We've come to the conclusion that an individual named Anthony Warner is the bomber and he was present when the bomb went off and that he perished in the bombing," said Donald Cochran, US Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.
Motives
Officials said it was too early in the investigation to discuss the suspect's motives.
Warner's motor home, parked on a downtown street of Tennessee's largest city, exploded at dawn on Friday, moments after police responding to reports of gunfire heard music and an automated message emanating from the vehicle warning of a bomb.
The explosion injured three people and damaged businesses, including an AT&T switching centre, disrupting mobile, internet and TV services across central Tennessee and parts of four other states.
The owner of Fridrich & Clark Realty, Steve Fridrich, told a newspaper that for four or five years Warner had come into the office once a month to provide computer consulting services.
Earlier this month, he told the company in an email that he would no longer be working for it.
He gave no reason, Mr Fridrich said.
"He seemed very personable to us all here, so this is quite out of character I think," he added.
Nashville Mayor John Cooper said officials felt there had to be a connection between the bombing and the AT&T Inc building.

Tourism board's €540k spend on Covid surveys

The tourism body said the expenditure included five separate waves of research between May and November.
The bill so far has come to €543,328, excluding VAT.
The latest stage of the research - conducted in November - saw the "lowest levels of comfort" about taking a European trip.
Dreaming
While Tourism Ireland said the survey pre-dated the announcement of vaccines, Ireland still ranked highly among tourists when it came to comfort levels.
The research showed holidaymakers were still "planning and dreaming of their next trip".
"Personal indulgence and a treat after the difficult lockdown period are driving motivations in travel," said a briefing note.
Lower rates of Covid-19 and a vaccine were considered key factors in encouraging travel, but also comprehensive insurance, the availability of high-quality healthcare, and access to testing.
The Tourism Ireland brief said: "The island of Ireland is considered one of the most comfortable destinations for a short break or holiday during social distancing.
"However, comfort levels have reduced - for both the island of Ireland and for other destinations."
The research - involving surveys of people in the UK, US, Germany, and France - found that many were unsure about a holiday location for 2021.
Those surveyed said word of mouth, official government sources, price comparison websites and travel agents would influence them most.
Tourism Ireland said it expects an "improvement" in confidence in the next wave of research.
It said this would identify which groups are ready to holiday again in summer and which markets offer the "best prospects" for Ireland.
A spokesperson said: "The insights we gain will ensure that our future promotional plan is as tightly targeted and as powerfully motivational as it possibly can be, in order to drive a strong recovery."
It said the first two phases had been carried out by Kantar Millward Brown.
The later phases were conducted by Red C Research.

€437,000 deal struck to hold criminal trials in Croker

A contract has been agreed for the holding of criminal trials there for three months, beginning in the middle of next month.
Under the deal, the Courts Service will pay the GAA €437,000 for the use of the ground's conference facilities, which are viewed as ideal for facilitating compliance with pandemic social distancing requirements.
It is expected to cost an additional €302,000 to run the courts there over the three months when security, catering and information and communications technology (ICT) costs are taken into account.
However, much of the ICT will be repurposed for use elsewhere by the Courts Service when the deal ends.
Space in courtrooms has been an issue since the pandemic struck, particularly in cases where juries are required.
New criminal trials were not held between March and July following the first Covid-19 lockdown, leading to a significant backlog of cases.
When criminal cases did return in September, they were limited to 12 trial venues around the country.
The Courts Service spent months identifying alternative venues that could safely accommodate large numbers of people.
Under the deal, three courts will sit at Croke Park and 200 court sitting days are provided for.
Requirements
The stadium will host trials that are expected to take longer than usual, while six courtrooms in the Criminal Courts of Justice on Parkgate Street will continue to focus on trials that typically take a shorter time to hear.
A contract was signed earlier this month by Courts Service chief executive Angela Denning and Croke Park's head of business Mark Dorman.
In a statement, the Court Service said it had "very specific requirements" that needed to be met in searching for alternative court venues.
Ms Denning said the facilities at Croke Park would provide "a venue which is respectful of the importance of the proceedings" and "respects the professional needs and the security, privacy and dignity of court users".

'It is still a lose-lose on Brexit', say EU bosses

Mairead McGuinness warned of the implications for business, trade and fisheries while saying she hopes the agreement will form a positive basis for renewed cooperation with the UK.
The Financial Services Commissioner also said she is confident Ireland will be "the major recipient" of a €5bn EU fund being set up to help member states affected by Brexit.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney is due to brief Cabinet today on the deal in a meeting that was brought forward by a day as part of the process of ratifying the agreement.
The deal is set to be voted on by MPs in Westminster on Wednesday.
Ms McGuinness said that the full implications on the future relationship between the EU and UK will only begin to be felt over time.
The commissioner said talks "went to the wire" and described the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier as "a superstar", adding: "His deep understanding of Ireland was an immense asset."
She argued that European unity has been given a massive boost by Brexit but suggested the deal "defies the normal gravity of trade talks" where the parties generally want greater co-ordination - not less.
"The EU continues to view Brexit as a lose-lose situation - but we hope this deal will be a positive basis for renewed co-operation," she said.
January 1 will mark a new era of trading with the UK for businesses and it "will be harder" due to increased paperwork and customs checks at EU-UK borders, the Commissioner warned.
"Fortunately on the island of Ireland the Northern Ireland Protocol means there will be no hard Border," she said.
Costs
For food sales to the UK she said "the deal is better than no deal" but there will not be unfettered market access.
"The scenes of trucks queuing on UK motorways were a sign of what can happen when the free flow of goods is interrupted," she said, adding: "transport costs will increase."
"Given the 'take back control' narrative from the UK, including control of their waters, it is no surprise that our fishing communities are deeply concerned."
There have been concerns Ireland will face stiff competition from others to secure a decent share of the €5bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve.

'No water charges', say FF and FG after TD floats costs idea

Green Party junior housing minister Malcolm Noonan had suggested the "possibility of introducing water charges should be explored" within the lifetime of the coalition.
However, the senior Housing Minister, Fianna Fáil's Darragh O'Brien, told the Herald last night there will be "no review" of the issue.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar added: "The reintroduction of water charges is not in the Programme for Government, so it won't be happening under this Government.
"What we are introducing is charges for people who waste water or use excess water.
"That's coming into effect, but that's a very different thing."
He said "anything can be discussed", and added that he never thought water charges were a bad idea.
However, the Fine Gael leader told Newstalk Radio: "The decision was made back under the last government that we wouldn't have water charges.
"That was reaffirmed in the Programme for Government."
Mr Noonan put the contentious issue back on the table with remarks he made in an interview with the Sunday Independent.
He suggested the reintroduction of charges could be proposed alongside a future referendum to enshrine Irish Water in public ownership and avoid privatisation.
"It does require political courage and also good messaging for us to appreciate that this is going to be the most significant resource challenge that we have in coming years," he said.
He said Dublin's water supply is "teetering on the brink", and added: "Water charges would certainly focus people's attention on conserving what is a very scarce resource."
Mr O'Brien outlined plans last night for investing in water services as he reacted to Mr Noonan's remarks.
"There will be no review of the domestic water charges issue, that issue has been dealt with," he said.
Investment
Mr O'Brien said the Programme for Government is clear on the Coalition's plans for water, and an €8.5bn package committed to in Project Ireland 2040 will be delivered.
He said there is planned investment of nearly €90m between the Saggart Reservoir Project and Ballycoolen Trunk Watermain Project, both due to start next year.
"The Government are playing a pivotal role in ensuring our water supplies are sufficient to meet housing and development needs and that legacy infrastructure deficiencies are dealt with and that compliance with environmental standards is strictly adhered to," he added.

'Why are we waiting four days?' - red tape behind delay in vaccine

The first 10,000 doses of vaccine arrived in Ireland on Saturday but the first patients won't get them until tomorrow - and then only a small number.
A number of European countries began their vaccination programmes yesterday.
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly last night rejected claims this amounted to a delay here, insisting it is being brought forward by a day.
Cabinet will discuss the Covid-19 situation, including the present restrictions, this afternoon amid a worrying rise in cases in recent days.
Four more people have died and 744 new cases were reported yesterday. That's down from the 1,296 new cases reported on Saturday.
But chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last night warned of a "deteriorating disease trajectory" and said he expects higher numbers to be recorded when more people get tested post-Christmas.
Meanwhile, HSE boss Paul Reid, told RTÉ that vaccinations will start tomorrow. A small number will be administered in Beaumont, St James's, Cork and Galway University hospitals.
He said Ireland wants to "do this right" and there is a "complex consent process" in relation to the elderly and ­vulnerable.
In the North, where the roll-out of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine began before Christmas, GP surgeries have already started to receive a second vaccine by AstraZeneca. The UK's regulatory body is expected to approve its use in the coming days and GPs are drawing up lists of their patients aged over 80 who will receive it first.
The Herald understands that finalising the informed consent process was one of the reasons the roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine did not start here immediately.
There is concern in health circles over the highly litigious medical legal environment in Ireland in recent years.
Vaccines are rigorously tested and side-effects are usually mild. The EU and other jurisdictions that have approved the Covid-19 jab have insisted it meets safety standards.
Dr Rita Doyle, the president of the Medical Council, had expressed her dissatisfaction with the timing of the roll-out on Twitter on St Stephen's Day, asking: "Why are we waiting four days to start vaccinations?" adding "This is an emergency."
Last night she said she welcomed the change to the roll-out plan, with vaccinations due to start tomorrow instead of Wednesday.
Frustrated
"I am a practising GP. Like doctors around this country, in fact like all of us, I am ­frustrated with this virus.
"I am frustrated that numbers are rising again at an alarming rate," she said.
But she said this was "being replaced by hope" now the jabs will begin tomorrow.
Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon took to social media to claim: "There's an annoying lack of ambition or self-confidence around our vaccination programme."
He said vaccinations have begun elsewhere in Europe while "we have two boxes carried on a forklift to great fanfare lying in a warehouse for four days".
Mr Donnelly argued such criticism was "unfounded".
He told the Herald: "We took delivery on the 26th. We'll be vaccinating on the 29th so the question I would put back is are people suggesting that we don't follow the expert advice?
"Are they suggesting we don't make sure informed consent is correct? We are clinically led. We have to get this right."
Mr Donnelly said training of staff is taking place and the informed consent process is being put in place.
He added a lot of work has gone into making sure that the informed consent process is "legally robust".
Separately, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar admitted that Ireland is slower in rolling out the vaccine than some other countries but promised "we will catch up".
He said roughly 40,000 doses will be arriving every week from January.
He said Cabinet will be reviewing the decision to allow non-essential retailers to stay open in the wake of a National Public Health Emergency Team recommendation that they should be closed.
Meanwhile, the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL), the largest medical virology laboratory in the country, closed on Christmas Day and will reopen tomorrow.
An 'on-call' service has been in operation since December 25, but Covid-19 result requests cannot be accommodated over the four-day period of closure.
The lab is also closed for three days from January 1 to January 3. The HSE said the NVRL normally processes around 700 swabs per day.
In a statement, the HSE said: "The HSE processes between 10,000 and 20,000 tests per day based on demand. The NVRL were not required from Friday 25th to Tuesday 29th.
"This has no negative impact on testing responses as we are still working within our available capacity."

1 out of 8 motorists drove the morning after booze

The AA Ireland research found 13pc of motorists got behind the wheel the morning after drinking at some point during the past two years.
"Some people will think a few hours' sleep and a strong coffee will have them in a position to drive safely the morning after, but you could easily still be above the limit and represent a danger to yourself and other road users," said Conor Faughnan, AA Ireland's director of consumer affairs.
More than 5,000 motorists were questioned, and one in eight admitted driving the morning after a few drinks while uncertain if their blood-alcohol level had returned to the legal limit.
Nearly 8pc of motorists admitted having driven under those circumstances on at least one occasion, and 4.07pc said they had done so up to five times.
Only one driver in 200 took the risk on five or more occasions.
The survey results come after repeated road safety and anti-drink-driving campaigns in recent years and a tightening of the law on driving over the limit.
The AA also found 4pc had been the passenger in a car when they knew or suspected the driver to be over the limit.
More than 2.5pc had found themselves in a car being driven by someone likely or potentially over the limit in the past two years, and 2.05pc said this had happened on more than one occasion.
The AA is encouraging drivers to never drive after drinking.
"Many of us will be spending time between Christmas and New Year with family that we may not have seen much over the past year," Mr Faughnan said.
"Understandably, even if a traditional night out isn't an option this Christmas, people will want to celebrate with their loved ones in some manner.
Tolerated
"However, if you know that you must travel the following day, it's important you act appropriately.
"We've come a long way in terms of our attitude to drink-driving as a country, and the overwhelming majority of us view it as something that should never be done or tolerated.
"Unfortunately, there exists a small number of people who that message hasn't reached yet and they continue to risk not only their own lives but the lives of other road users.
"Just as there's no valid reason for getting behind the wheel while over the limit, there's no valid reason for allowing someone to drive in that condition."

The New Year will continue with spells of sunshine with some heavy, wintry showers.
Met Éireann has two Status Yellow weather alerts scheduled to end today - with a snow and ice warning in place for eight counties and a wind warning in place for seven.
The snow and ice warning remains in place until 7am for Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Longford, Louth, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo.
A wind warning remains in place until 2pm for Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Cork and Kerry.
Irish coastal waters are also the focus of a Status Orange gale warning with winds reaching up to Storm Force 10.
The UK Met Office has also issued a snow and ice warning for six Ulster counties.
Across the west and south, power was restored by ESB repair crews to 2,000 homes who lost electricity supplies at the height of Storm Bella which swept over Ireland on St Stephen's Day with winds gusting to over 110kmh.
Flooding
The worst disruption was in Kerry, Cork, Limerick, Clare and Waterford.
Coastal flooding was also reported in parts of the west and south.
Some roads were left impassable by heavy rainfall.
Met Éireann said the three days until New Year's Eve will be very unsettled.
"A cold and blustery end to 2020 is in store, though it will remain largely dry away from Atlantic coasts.
"There will be a continued risk of frost at night also."
Today will be blustery with widespread showers of rain or hail, turning wintry on higher ground and highest temperatures of 4C to 7C degrees but feeling very cold in fresh to strong and gusty north-westerly winds.

Council will order star Coughlan to demolish granny flat on her land

The board has rejected an appeal by the blues singer against Wicklow County Council's decision to grant retrospective permission for the transformation of an outbuilding at her home on the slopes of the Little Sugar Loaf outside Kilmacanogue into an independent living unit for her daughter's family.
The Galway singer had been issued with a formal notice by the council in June last year that the granny flat, which was built three years earlier, was an unauthorised development.
Outlining the basis for its decision, the board said it was an objective of the council's county development plan to strengthen the established structures of villages and smaller settlements in Wicklow.
It said it was doing this in order to support local economies and accommodate additional population in a way that supported the viability of local infrastructure, businesses and services.
It claimed that allowing the second home at the singer's property would "give rise to sporadic housing in a rural area lacking certain public services and community facilities and served by a poor road network".
Pollution
As a consequence, the board said the building contravened the council's objective and would lead to demands for the uneconomic provision of services in an area where they were not planned.
The board said Ms Coughlan had also not demonstrated that domestic effluent from the building would be treated to the required standard and, therefore, it posed a threat of groundwater pollution and public health.
In addition, it said that the minor road where the singer's home is was "seriously sub-standard" and lacked footpaths, cycle paths and public lighting.
Granny flats are only permitted by Wicklow County Council under certain conditions, including where their needs are justified for use by a close family member where they form an integrated part of the main building and are under 45 square metres.
The ruling means Ms Coughlan is likely to face enforcement proceedings to demolish the unauthorised building.

Declan Kiniry (32) allegedly assaulted the driver by approaching him from behind and hitting him up to four times, a court was told.
Judge David McHugh said he would need to see evidence of the man's injuries before deciding whether to allow the case to remain in Blanchardstown District Court.
Mr Kiniry, of Earlsfort Drive, Lucan, is charged with assault causing harm at Woodford Walk, Clondalkin, on February 18, 2018.
The DPP directed summary disposal of the case in the district court and Judge David McHugh asked to hear an outline of the allegations for the consideration of jurisdiction.
Confronted
Garda Sergeant Walter Sweeney said the taxi driver told gardaí he picked up three passengers, including the accused, at around 4am.
They got out of the taxi and walked away without paying the fare and the driver confronted one of them.
It was alleged that the driver was approached from behind by the accused, who then punched him in the face, nose and neck.
There had been a row during the journey, which had culminated in the non-payment of the fare, Sgt Sweeney said.
The taxi driver was paid later.
Judge McHugh said he could not make a decision on jurisdiction without hearing more about the injuries and adjourned the case to a date in March.

New phone screen able to 'heal' itself

Consumers spend millions of euro every year on repairing fragile screens, but innovations from South Korean could put an end to this with "self-healing" screens containing linseed oil that are capable of fixing cracks on their own in minutes.
Hardens
Scientists led by Dr Yong-Chae Jung have developed microcapsules filled with the oil that can be mixed into the polymer used for screens.
When the screen cracks, the internal capsules also crack and release oil into the damaged glass that hardens into a transparent solid, 'healing' the screen.
The team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology wrote in the scientific publication Composites Part B: Engineering that the "simple self-healing behaviour of polymers is highly desirable for industrial applications".
Scientists were able to "develop a self-healing, colourless" material that can "radically solve the physical properties and lifespan" of damaged surfaces.
The innovation could prove useful for smartphones, with the self-releasing oil solution able to harden at room temperature without the need for expert intervention.
The process can be speeded up if the phone is exposed to higher temperatures. Scientists claim linseed repairs cracks in 91pc of cases.
The effectiveness of the process may "eventually be widely used in outdoor applications" for technology that employs the phone screen material.

Referendum needed to get maternity for TDs - Martin

He said the introduction of a proper system of maternity leave for TDs and senators could require a referendum.
The issue has been back on the agenda since Justice Minister Helen McEntee confirmed she is pregnant.
Mr Martin said the Government has yet to decide on the arrangements on her plans to take leave.
Asked if there would be a substitute minister during that time, he said: "We haven't got that quite worked out yet."
There have been efforts in recent years to legislate for a formal maternity leave system for politicians.
A bill to allow Oireachtas members to take up to 26 weeks' maternity leave was put forward by Fianna Fáil TDs Anne Rabbitte and Niamh Smyth.
The then minority Government led by Fine Gael supported it in principle, but identified a number of issues that would have to be addressed.
The bill lapsed with the ­dissolution of the last Dáil in January.
Mr Martin asked about the issue of maternity leave for politicians during a pre-Christmas round-table interview with journalists.
He said: "It may very well require a referendum and perhaps should and there will be discussions on the matter with the Attorney General.
Reform
"There are issues there, of a constitutional nature, in terms of a member of the house. For example, as a TD or senator and as a minister."
But he added: "I think it doesn't reflect well on a modern democracy that we cannot facilitate a woman going on maternity leave in ministerial office.
"I think that's something we should rectify. The precise mechanisms to rectify that we are still examining.
"We will have to do some interim measures.
"I'm not talking just in the context of Helen McEntee, because Helen herself would want us to do it generally as a basic, necessary modern reform of our parliamentary democracy."
Mr Martin suggested that any reforms should cover paternity leave as well.

O'Carroll is facing claims of constructive dismissal and workplace discrimination following a dispute over pay.
Hollywood (41), who reportedly quit the sitcom earlier this year, is also taking legal action against the BBC.
"I feel I wasn't being paid equally and I wasn't being given an explanation for decisions," said Glaswegian Hollywood, who played Dino Doyle.
"When I tried to resolve it, nothing was done. I was just disregarded. But I won't put up with it any more.
"I won't be treated like that. This has gone too far. They shouldn't do this to people.
"I am taking legal action. The papers have been lodged for a tribunal and the process has now started."
Bosses
Hollywood said he thinks he was paid less than his co-stars for spin-off show All Round To Mrs Brown's.
He said that after he raised the issue with bosses, he was taken out of this year's special festive episodes.
A BBC spokesman declined to comment.

Diplomats hopeful Brexit deal can be agreed at last minute as talks continue

It would guarantee the EU and UK tariff-free access to each other's goods markets and fishing waters and ensure ongoing transport, energy, police and security links.
One diplomat said that while there was "no deal just yet", the prospect was "not without hope".
Another said there was "genuine" optimism.
"After nine months of gestation, surely it's time something's delivered," said one EU source.
However, talks were continuing well into last night to try to lock down a deal on fisheries - the most intractable issue in the talks.
Although it contributes less than 2pc to the bloc's economy, fishing is a totemic issue for Ireland and several other EU countries, including France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.
The EU believes its continued access to UK waters goes hand in hand with the UK's demand for access to the bloc's single market.
Negotiators had grown far apart on fisheries at the weekend, but a phone call between European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and British prime minister Boris Johnson on Monday helped get them back on track.
The UK wanted to claw back up to 60pc of the value of the EU's annual catch in its waters over three years, while the EU had suggested giving up 25pc over six years.
The two sides had also been squabbling over how - and in what sectors - the EU would be able to retaliate if it believes the UK has undercut it on product standards, state aid or fisheries.
EU lead negotiator Michel Barnier told MEPs this week that both sides would consult each other and an independent arbitration panel before taking any retaliatory measures.
Terrorist
The final text of a deal is expected to run to between 1,000 and 2,000 pages and cover not only goods and fisheries but matters such as social security, police cooperation and data protection.
A deal was reached some time ago on visa-free travel and health coverage for stays of up to 90 days.
The UK will also retain access to EU criminal records, terrorist DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration databases.
However, it was unclear yesterday when the EU would adopt "equivalence" decisions allowing UK financial services providers to continue operating in the bloc.
The EU has also invited UK universities to participate in its student and teacher exchange programme, Erasmus, but the UK has not confirmed if it will take part.
Trade talks were escalated to leaders' level this week after EU and UK teams exhausted all their options.
With a week to go until the end of a post-Brexit transition period, there had been a real risk of a no-deal period on January 1.
That could have meant chaos at UK and European ports, which saw a preview this week after France closed its borders to UK hauliers, fearing the spread of a new virus strain.
EU officials are now fast- tracking a legal process to ensure the deal applies provisionally from next month, pending approval by the EU and UK parliaments.
There is not enough time left for the European Parliament to vote on the text before the Brexit transition period ends on December 31.
"All of the things necessary for a proper political process are not possible for the time being," said German MEP Martin Schirdewan, a member of the European Parliament's Brexit coordination group.
"Those who should take the political decision and give their consent are not even aware of the details."
The deal will also need to be endorsed by the EU's 27 governments.
The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is involved in last-gasp talks with UK

Ryan Sharlott (21) dropped a box with an additional €3,300 worth of the drug when he fled from gardaí in a separate incident.
He was spared jail when he appeared before Blanchardstown District Court and admitted drug dealing offences.
Judge David McHugh gave him a 10-month suspended sentence.
Sharlott, of Woodavens, Clondalkin, pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis for sale or supply.
Garda Sergeant Maria Calla- ghan told the court gardaí saw the accused at Buirg an Ri Walk, Balgaddy, on February 20, 2018, as he walked through a playground carrying a black Tommy Hilfiger gift bag.
They followed him and cannabis worth €3,819 was found in the bag.
Fingerprints
Sharlott also pleaded guilty to cannabis sale or supply at Foxborough estate, Lucan, on March 27 last year.
Gardaí searched waste ground in the area and saw the accused walking towards them carrying a plastic box.
He threw the box away and fled, but was caught after a short chase.
The box, containing €3,300 worth of cannabis, was recovered and bore fingerprints that matched Sharlott's.
On November 16, 2018, gardaí stopped Sharlott for another search in Lucan and he was "extremely nervous".
On being told he was going to be taken to Lucan garda station for a search, he "took off running".
Sharlott had no previous convictions.
The court heard the accused had since stayed away from the people he had associated with.
Sharlott was "passionate" about football and his involvement included training children and organising tournaments, his defence said.
He had got internship work as a painter and decorator.
The lawyer accepted the charges were serious, but Sharlott had "changed his life around".

Christopher Slater (36) appeared in Dublin District Court accused of killing father-of-five Michael Barr (35) in the Sunset House in the north inner city.
He was remanded in custody to next week.
Mr Slater, with an address at Carnlough Road, Cabra, is charged with murdering Mr Barr at the pub on Summerhill Parade, Ballybough, on April 25, 2016.
The victim was standing at the counter when two men wearing masks entered and one of them shot him seven times.
At the time, Mr Barr, from Co Tyrone, was the seventh victim of the Hutch-Kinahan feud.
Detective Garda David Chap- man said in evidence that he arrested Mr Slater at the Bridewell garda station at 9.20pm on Tuesday for the purpose of charging him with the offence of murdering Michael Barr.
The accused made no reply to the charge after caution at 9.48pm and was handed a copy of the charge sheet.
No bail application was made on the accused's behalf as bail can only be granted at High Court level on a murder charge.
Judge Conal Gibbons re- manded Mr Slater in custody to appear in Cloverhill District Court on December 29 by way of video link.
Defence solicitor Eoghan O'Sullivan asked the judge if he could recommend that the warrant was made out to remand the accused to Mountjoy Prison instead.
Judge Gibbons refused, saying this was a matter for the prison authorities.
The judge granted free legal aid following an application by Mr O'Sullivan, who said Mr Slater was "not in receipt of any money".
The accused was not required to address the court during the brief hearing.
Convicted
Three other people have been charged and convicted in connection with the killing of Mr Barr.
Eamon Cumberton (33), of Mountjoy Street, Dublin 7, was jailed for life in 2018 at the Special Criminal Court after he was convicted of the murder.
Accomplice David Hunter (42), from Liverpool and with a previous address at Du Cane Road, White City, London, was jailed for life last month for taking part in the Kinahan cartel murder.
A third man, Martin Aylmer, was jailed for three years for helping an organised crime gang commit the murder.

Irish priest admits trying to deal crystal meth in New York

Fr Michael O'Leary was arrested in New York last year with a half ounce of the drug along with weighing scales, two glass pipes and several zip-locked bags.
At the time the Dublin-born priest was at the centre of a will dispute before the High Court with his siblings which was adjourned because of his arrest.
The Herald has learned that Fr O'Leary (52) is now awaiting sentencing in New York after admitting to attempted drug dealing.
Court records state that he has pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, methamphetamine, with the intent to sell it.
The offence is classified as a C Felony under New York State Law, which can carry a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment.
In less serious cases it can also result in probation with no jail time at all, or between one and two years imprisonment.
Methamphetamine is a powerful synthetic stimulant more commonly known as crystal meth.
It is highly addictive and is on par with crack cocaine in terms of harmful affects.
The priest has also admitted to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
This offence is a less serious crime and is categorised as a misdemeanor.
Fr O'Leary's case remains before Westchester County Criminal Court and he is currently out on bail with the matter due to be heard again in the new year.
A court clerk said the case is currently listed for 'compliance' for a judge to ensure that he is abiding by conditions set out by the court.
Grams
The priest's US lawyer, assigned through a legal aid scheme, did not respond to requests for comment.
According to the initial arrest record, Fr O'Leary was the driver of a 2018 Toyota vehicle that was searched by police officers in the early hours of March 17, 2019.
Inside, officers discovered a number of zip-locked bags, 16 grams of methamphetamine, and two glass pipes.
One of the pipes had residue of the drug on it, while digital weighing scales were also recovered in the glove box of the vehicle.
His co-accused Alberto Calderon (29), from Brooklyn, faced three charges including the sale of drugs and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.
During his initial court appearances in 2019, Fr O'Leary was criticised by the presiding judge for only completing 80 days of a 90-day drug rehabilitation programme.
The Archdiocese of New York last year confirmed that Fr O'Leary was suspended but did not respond to requests for comment this week.
In a previous statement, it said: "O'Leary is still a priest, but he has not had an assignment for several years and is currently suspended."
In a Decree of Suspension issued two days after his St Patrick's Day arrest, the Archdiocese recommended he be dismissed.
It cited "Fr O'Leary's persistent disobedience, his manifest lack of suitability for ministry and his arrest for possession of illegal drugs".
The priest's arrest first came to light in June 2019 when it emerged that a will dispute before the High Court between him and his three siblings was delayed because of his detention.

The news has forced all cabinet members to restrict their movements pending test results that were due last night and this morning.
Ministers were told they were not considered close contacts, meaning they will be free to go about their business, provided they have returned a negative test.
A spokesman for Mr McConalogue said he had followed public health guidelines after his return from Brussels, where he was on government business.
The Donegal TD was spotted on South Anne Street, just off Grafton Street, at about lunchtime on Tuesday.
He was in the queue at Sheridan's Cheesemongers.
The minister also stopped to talk with Fine Gael TD Fergus O'Dowd, with both men wearing masks, on the same street.
He was shopping in the city centre a short time after the cabinet meeting in Dublin Castle, at which ministers signed off on plans to re-impose Level 5 restrictions in the coming days.
Mr McConalogue's spokesman said the Fianna Fáil TD had followed the rules for members of the Government who have returned from essential foreign travel.
The minister attended an EU agriculture meeting in Brussels last week.
Protocols
He returned to Ireland on Thursday and was immediately tested and returned a negative result.
Under the protocols, ministers are tested again five days later.
Mr McConalogue underwent his second scheduled test at around 4pm on Tuesday. It returned a positive result yesterday morning.
Citing a government memo, his spokesman said Irish residents who travel overseas for essential purposes, including cabinet ministers, and restrict their movements apart from that purpose while overseas, are not advised to restrict their movements on their return to Ireland.
"Therefore, he didn't have to restrict his movements," the spokesman said.
"He followed the rules, he followed the guidelines, he was doing his confirmatory test a few days later and he was not required to restrict his movements in that time.
"There is no impropriety here and he was wearing a mask at all times yesterday [Tuesday]."
Mr McConalogue wore a mask throughout the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle, which was socially distanced and lasted less than two hours.
After the positive test was confirmed, ministers were contacted by an official in the Department of the Taoiseach, and the National Ambulance Service was dispatched to carry out swabbing, with the results expected within hours.
Some ministers privately questioned why Mr McConalogue did not appear via video link at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, with one noting that Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe did so earlier this month following a foreign trip.
Mr McConalogue's spokesman said the rules were clear and there was no requirement for ministers to restrict their movements on return from essential travel abroad.
The minister is now self-isolating in Donegal and was not showing symptoms of the virus yesterday.

Mutating virus could be to blame for soaring infections

Preliminary data has found it in the east of the country.
The new strain, which is believed to be much more infectious, may not only be driving the virus among some adults; it has been suggested it could also be easier for children to catch.
The possibility was raised by WHO envoy David Nabarro and some UK scientists yesterday.
However, like much about this strain, so full of un- knowns, more investigation is needed.
If it is more transmiss- ible among children it could have implications for schools re-opening.
Hot on its heels yesterday came news of another mutant strain from South Africa, which is even more infectious.
It is thanks to the expertise of scientists at COG-UK (the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium) that we have been alerted to the new strain.
They are leading the way in trying to analyse its impact.
Prof Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist in Imperial College London, suggests the new variant may make children more like adults in the infection and spread of the virus.
The re-opening of schools here since September has been a success, due partly to the low transmission rates among children.
Priority
COG-UK says it is not familiar with any data now to support that suggestion.
If it is found to spread more among children, it will lead to questions about re-opening schools after Christmas.
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan remained strongly of the view yesterday that schools will re-open, saying it is a core priority.
The biggest threat would be high levels of community transmission.
Recent weeks have seen a number of school outbreaks, although they remain low.
Schools have continued to operate without interruption since September, even during the last escalation in spread in October and the six-week lockdown.
Around 30,000 people have arrived from Britain in the past two weeks, and the health authorities here are putting them in the spotlight.
GPs have been alerted, and anyone who arrived from Britain in the past 14 days is being advised to self-isolate - to not mix with any other household members, leave the house or see visitors for a full 14 days after arrival.
This is because they could be incubating the new strain of the virus.
All will be contacted by the HSE via text message from the contact details they put on their passenger locator forms.
They will also be advised to contact a GP or out-of-hours service to organise a free Covid test, whether or not they have symptoms on day five after arrival, or as soon as possible after that.
Even if their test is negative or not detected, they must self-isolate for the full 14 days.
In particular, the HSE is concerned about young and old people mixing during the holidays.
Many will already have had a private test, and irrespective of whether this is negative or non-detected, they must go into self-isolation.
GPs were told to be on high alert for people with symptoms who have returned from Britain and to be vigilant about infection prevention and control measures when assessing or providing care to them.

Panic took hold of many Irish people when a ban on all travel to and from Britain came into effect at midnight on Sunday to tackle the mutant strain of Covid-19 that is taking hold in the south-east of England.
Overbooked
The rushin the hope of catching a last-minute flight home which left saw a flight from Heathrow to Dublin over-booked, with some passengers left behind.
Caroline Werfelli, Saffron Werfelli and Alex Shorten, from Limerick, were among those stuck in Britain who returned home on a char- tered flight from Stansted to Dublin on Tuesday evening.
On Monday, the Depart- ment of Foreign Affairs quickly set up a hotline for Irish residents so it could arrange flights home for citizens.
More than 500 calls were made to the hotline on its first day in operation, while consular flights and ferry access were organised for those who were legitimately unable to leave Britain.
Mick Morrissey, from Kilmeaden, Co Waterford, was clearly delighted to be back on Irish soil as he held his bags aloft after returning to Dublin from Stansted on Monday evening.
Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney confirmed yesterday that the flights were only for residents who were in Britain short-term or in transit.
The flights would not be available to Irish people living in Britain who had intended to travel home for the Christmas break.
The Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed there would be only two or three flights a day on Monday and Tuesday to get people home.
Chaos
There was chaos at Heathrow on Sunday night, with one Irish passenger describing the scenes as like being in "an end of the world movie", with hundreds of people trying to get on to flights that became overbooked.
"At least one flight will depart from London. The other departure airport will be decided by the demand from those who contact the Department of Foreign Affairs assistance line," a spokesperson said.

Shops face order to shut on St Stephen's Day as disease spreads

The latest blow comes as many people are cancelling Christmas plans and businesses are braced for weeks of lockdown.
The highly infectious strain of the virus - which the UK blames for its rocketing case numbers - has been found in the east of the country and looks set to take hold.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) met yesterday and are recommending the Government impose tougher restrictions amid panic over the soaring spread of the virus.
Spreading
"Our level of concern continues to escalate," he warned.
It is understood this involves telling non-essential retail they will have to shut down again from December 26.
There were 13 more Covid-19 related deaths yesterday and 938 cases while the R number - signalling how fast the virus is spreading - is now higher than in the dark days of March, with daily cases ­currently jumping 7-9pc.
Prof Philip Nolan, who tracks the virus, said the restrictions announced on Tuesday, closing pubs and restaurants from this evening and restricting home visits and inter-county travel, will not be enough to stop the country heading into a crisis.
Dr Holohan blamed the upsurge on socialising, particularly since pubs and restaurants reopened, for the huge growth in infection and is the dominant cause of the rise in cases rather than the new strain of virus.
Prof Nolan said he is not confident the measures announced earlier this week go far enough and are sufficient to bring the R number below 1.
"We are starting from an R number that is 1.6 or could be 1.8," he said.
Earlier Prof Nolan warned the virus is spreading among all age groups and spreading to older people who are vulnerable to the virus early on compared to the last surge in October.
Hospitalisations are rising, although admissions to intensive care are declining.
Patients
There were 251 patients in ­hospital yesterday and 25 in intensive care.
The fear is hospitals will be overwhelmed as more patients who are seriously ill have to be admitted at a time when ­people with other illnesses crowd our Emergency Departments after Christmas.
Asked why hospitality is being targeted for closures when HSE figures yesterday showed no outbreaks in pubs or restaurants last week, Dr Holohan said the significant rise in cases coincided with the first week such businesses were allowed to reopen.
He again urged the public: "Revise your Christmas plans to ensure social contacts are limited and that hand hygiene, physical distance, ventilation and face-covering measures are in place if you must have visitors to your home."
Cillian De Gascun of the National Virus Reference Laboratory confirmed "preliminary data would suggest, based on a selection of samples analysed from the weekend, that the novel variant from the UK is already present in Ireland.
"However, given the timeline of the samples analysed, it would seem that the novel variant is not solely responsible for the recent increase in case numbers seen in Ireland."
They accounted for around 10pc of the samples they had analysed and this is likely to grow, he added.
Northern Ireland's Department of Health last night also confirmed a positive test for the new variant of the coronavirus first detected in the UK.
Earlier, the HSE said it expects to receive around 40,000 doses of the vaccine over the first week of its roll-out, beginning with the initial batch of 9,750 which will arrive on St Stephen's Day.
Residents and workers in long-term care as well as frontline staff in vaccination sites in Beaumont Hospital, St James's Hospital, Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway will be the first to be offered the jab across a "three-week sweep".
At the end of December daily cases could be as high as 1,000 and soar to 1,500 in the first week of the year.
In order to cope, the HSE is only to test the close contacts of people who are found to have the infection once, instead of twice.

John Gali (44) admitted taking €144 worth of goods from Penneys in a "moment of madness".
Judge David McHugh said the "mind boggles" as to why Gali did it, but he would strike the case out, leaving him without a conviction, if he made a €300 charity donation.
Gali, of Collegewood Manor, Clane, Co Kildare, pleaded guilty to theft.
Blanchardstown District Court heard the accused went to Penneys, Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, on February 21.
Convictions
He placed a number of items worth a combined €114 into his bag and walked out of the shop without paying.
Gali had no previous convictions.
The accused had been in Ireland for 18 years and had held the same stable job in manufacturing for most of that time, the court heard.
Judge McHugh asked defence solicitor Simon Fleming what Gali's difficulty was on the day of the theft.
"It was just a moment of madness, he shouldn't have done it," Mr Fleming said.
He said Gali had learned his lesson and was very embarr- assed to be in court.

Vasile Ursu (36) is facing weapons and public order charges following the alleged incident in which nobody was harmed.
Judge Bryan Smyth adjourned the case at Dublin District Court.
Mr Ursu, of no fixed address, is charged with the possession of a knife and public intoxication at garda headquarters in Phoenix Park, Dublin, last June 5.
The DPP directed summary disposal of the case at district court level, subject to a judge considering the issue of jurisdiction.
Threaten
A garda sergeant said it was alleged the accused went to garda headquarters on the day in question and "said he wanted to see the commissioner".
When he was told he could not see him, he took out a penknife, it was alleged.
He placed it on the ground in front of staff, but did not threaten or point it at anyone, the sergeant said.
Judge Smyth said he would accept jurisdiction to allow the case to remain in the district court.
The defence solicitor asked Judge Smyth to certify for a Romanian interpreter.
The judge adjourned the case to a date in March.
Mr Ursu was not required to be present in court and was remanded on continuing bail in his absence.

The former model said she is taking the positives out of a tough year after her father was seriously ill with Covid-19 last April.
Denis Palmer has fully recovered, but he spent two weeks in ICU and developed a bad bout of pneumonia at the same time.
"It's been the craziest year of my life. Unfortunately, Covid hit my own family, my dad was really, really ill at the start," said Claudine.
Devastated
"It was so shocking because it just seemed so far away and then it was right on our doorstep.
"I'm an emotional person anyway, and my family means everything and I was devastated that I couldn't see him or be with him."
Claudine was talking on former Big Brother winner Brian Dowling's Big Camp Christmas Chats podcast.
She expressed her gratitude for the little positives this year gave her, such as being able to spend more time with her Irish football star Husband Robbie and their sons Robert Jr and Hudson.
"When I say Rob and myself, we never got to be together as much as we have been in the last few months, he was always travelling," she said.
"So sometimes going back to the bare essentials can be good for the soul.
"Like Rob got to play with the kids in the garden for the summer.
"But it's definitely a year I will look back on and think, 'Wow, how did we get through it?'
"I'm trying my best to see the goodness, and people and communities came together and people raised a lot of money for charity."
Claudine said Christmas this year means only one thing to her - family.
"That's definitely what it means to me, particularly as someone who has lived away for so long," she said.
Claudine said people are appreciating the little comforts in life now more than ever before.
"My plans are if we get a vaccine and everything is safe, just to start living life to the full," she said.
"I'll enjoy everything and appreciate everything. I'm really excited about the future now because it looks like there might be an end in sight.
"If it does, we'll party into 2021."

The 60-year-old comedian and presenter broke three bones in his back after being thrown from a bull at a rodeo in Ohio.
He suffered the injury while filming for the programme Bradley Walsh & Son: Breaking Dad with his 23-year-old son Barney.
Although he had to be taken to hospital for treatment after falling off the bull, Walsh was back up walking the next day.
He said the incident made him realise life is "precious".
"We went to the rodeo and ended up on a bull," he said on The Jonathan Ross Show.
"Came off and I hit the floor like a sack of potatoes and broke my back in three places.
Walk
"Two days after, I'm trying to climb an ice mountain.
"When you get to our age, JR, all of a sudden the thoughts of your mortality really come home.
"I now realise that this time last year I might have come out of hospital not being able to walk again.
"So, consequently, you've got to be 'Life's precious', Barney, isn't it?
"Barney is the man now at 23 that I always wanted to be. And that's absolutely true.
"He's got no fear, he's young, he's finding his first feet in business and stuff. I just always wanted to do that.
"Anything Barney wants to do on the show, I'll give it a go."
The Jonathan Ross Show is on Virgin Media Two on Sunday at 11.10pm

A task force was established to help the disadvantaged part of the capital amid the violent gang feud that began in 2016.
Finance Minster Paschal Donohoe - a TD for the area - hailed progress made by the NEIC initiative at a launch outside the regenerated St Mary's Mansions housing complex.
He said the "beautiful homes" delivered in the refurbished block are an example of progress that has been made.
Mr Donohoe also said the gardaí have done an "incredible job" in the area, responding to the "huge threat of organised crime that we faced four years ago".
He said yesterday's launch was taking place near the locations of "terrible murders" that happened in recent years.
"Due to the efforts of the gardaí, they have been successful in bringing to justice those who needed to be brought to justice," Mr Donohoe said:
Threats
"The guards have also been very successful in preventing further crime and further threats to local residents in recent years.
"Without their work, we wouldn't have been able to achieve what has been achieved."
He also said efforts to help the area were "more than the security response" and were about how local communities are supported.
Mr Donohoe highlighted the improvements to housing as well as work in local primary schools that will continue into next year.
More than €6.5m was spent as part of NEIC taskforce initiatives in 2020.
Work has included the City Connects Programme that aims to build a network of support for primary school students in the NEIC, their families and the schools that serve them.
Progress has also been made by the drug and alcohol addiction response team, the homeless case management team and the residential stabilisation programme.
The three initiatives were originally fully-funded by the NEIC and have now secured mainstream funding from the Department of Health for next year.

Gilligan pays €12,000 for festive break from prison

The convicted drug smuggler secured his freedom less than two months after being caged following his arrest for suspected drugs and weapons offences.
The size of the payment the 68-year-old had to make was revealed as he began his second week of conditional bail following a successful attempt by his lawyers to rescue him from his cell while the investigation against him continues.
Gilligan, who was arrested on October 20 after a gun was found buried in the garden of his Costa Blanca home, has been banned from leaving Spain and ordered to sign on every fortnight at court as part of his release conditions.
He is thought to have returned to the villa near the town of Torrevieja where he was arrested so he can celebrate Christmas.
Gilligan and his girlfriend, a British woman known only as Sharon, were among six people held by police.
His son Darren was also detained.
The arrests took place following a lengthy police investigation into a drug smuggling gang allegedly led by Gilligan.
Detectives said at the time that they had seized 4kg of marijuana and 15,000 powerful sleeping pills called zimmos that heroin addicts use to help them sleep and numb pain.
Gilligan had been expected to remain behind bars for at least six months and could have been kept in prison without charge for at least two years.
"The individual's defence lawyer requested his conditional release on bail and the state prosecution service did not oppose the request," a judicial source said of Gilligan's unexpected release, which was approved by a judge at Torrevieja's Court of Instruction.
Passport
"The court agreed to release this person on bail because it considers the investigation is nearly completed.
"As conditions of his release, as well as the payment of bail, he has been banned from leaving Spain, his passport has been removed and he has to sign on every fortnight at court."
Gilligan and the five other suspects have not yet been charged, as formal charges are only laid in Spain shortly before trial.
All six are currently classified as "investigados", meaning they are under formal investigation.
State prosecutors have not yet been invited to submit a formal accusation.

The group released the song on social media for those left stranded away from home during the lockdown.
Fermoy International Choir, which was founded by Graham Clifford and Lisa Dunphy, recorded their version of Silent Night for Irish people who cannot get home and for new Irish citizens worried about relatives and friends in their native countries.
As part of the recording, special Christmas greetings were included in more than a dozen languages for loved ones in countries including Brazil, Poland and China.
Choir members also designed special Christmas cards.
The choir was set up two years ago to reflect the fact that one in four people now living in Fermoy, Co Cork, were born outside Ireland.
Mr Clifford said they wanted to do something to show solidarity with those away from home.
Many choir members are missing loved ones who are overseas and unable to return to Ireland for the festive season.
Others are unable to return to their home countries.
"This project, though a huge logistical challenge, has given our town a big lift," Mr Clifford said.
"There were a lot of tears shed in the making of this song and video.
"So many had loved ones away - sons, daughters, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.
"Not to forget others, originally from elsewhere, who won't be able to see their friends and family in their home country."
Motto
The choir regularly gives multilingual performances.
With 23pc of Fermoy's population born outside Ireland, the choir has adopted the motto "One Town, One Voice".
Silent Night was recorded, under current health and safety guidelines, at the Blackwater Studios in Glanworth, Co Cork.
The choir has been backed by the Government's Community Integration Fund 2021.

Mother who lost son in crash makes road safety plea

The appeal from Christina Donnelly came as Ireland has already exceeded the total number of road deaths recorded last year, with what is traditionally the most dangerous period of the year still to come between Christmas Eve and the New Year.
A total of 143 people have already died on Irish roads so far this year, two more than in all of 2019 (141) and seven more than the same period last year.
With the festive period still to come, fears are mounting that Ireland could see road deaths spiral by up to 10pc.
Gardaí and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) admitted the greatest cause for concern is that road deaths have soared despite two major lockdowns over the Covid-19 pandemic.
These lockdowns - which banned all but essential travel - cut road traffic by up to 70pc.
However, deaths rose steadily during the summer and autumn.
The 143 deaths so far this year included drivers (59), pedestrians (32), passengers (24), motorcyclists (17) and pedal cyclists (11).
Ms Donnelly lost her son, Brendan (24), in a tragedy caused by a drunk driver in Castlemartyr, Co Cork.
Misery
"I think every motorist should ask themselves: 'Do I really want to live the rest of my life knowing what pain, misery and suffering speed or drink or drug driving caused?'" she said.
"When you get behind the wheel, please drive safely so that you reach your destination and you are careful of the safety of all other road users."
Ms Donnelly has now devoted her life to promoting road safety so that other families don't suffer the nightmare she has endured.
"I don't want any other mother or father to go through the hell that we have endured every day," she said.
"Road safety campaigns are about protection and prevention. I don't want any parent to get that terrible knock on the door from the gardaí that I got."
In memory of her son, she campaigned for the so-called 'Brendan's Law' which sought tougher sentences and mandatory disqualifications for those convicted of drunk driving in collisions which resulted in serious injury or fatality.
She has also campaigned for crackdowns on speeding, drug driving and for greater resources for the Garda Traffic Corps.
Brendan died in a head-on collision outside Cork on October 26, 2009.
Brendan's best friend, Lee Salkeld (25), also died in the collision caused by a motorist who was coming home from a party where he had consumed a large quantity of drink and had even taken cocaine.

Partner of mum killed by suspected sepsis is still seeking answers

Barry Kelly (28), of Blessington, Co Wicklow, will mark the second anniversary of the death of his partner Karen McEvoy (24) on what should be the happiest time of the year.
Their three children, Toby (5), Jake (3) and Ruby (2), talk about her every day but her death has left a lasting void in the family's lives.
Ms McEvoy, originally from Tallaght, died in Naas General Hospital on December 25, 2018, after giving birth to Ruby on December 18 in the Coombe Hospital.
"We still do not know what has happened," Mr Kelly said.
"There is no closure and no findings to prevent this happening again.
"We have been let down. There were promises but they are just words."
Ms McEvoy had a normal birth in the Coombe and was discharged the following day on December 19 when blood tests were taken.
This was followed by a postnatal appointment two days later and a further visit to the Coombe on December 23 for baby Ruby's heel prick test.
However, Ms McEvoy was feeling ill with flu-like symptoms and was in such pain she was using crutches to walk.
While in the hospital she attended A&E where a urine test was taken.
She was told it might be sciatica and if got worse to go to Tallaght Hospital for an X-ray.
However, her condition did not improve and on Christmas morning her speech was slurred and she was swollen in her hands, face and legs and was transferred to Naas Hospital by ambulance.
Devastated
The couple attended Naas hospital where she was treated with antibiotics but then suffered a cardiac arrest.
An attempt was made by staff to save her life over the next 40 minutes but Ms McEvoy died, leaving Barry devastated.
The family's legal team, led by barrister Esther Earley and solicitor Niamh O' Brien of O'Brien Murphy solicitors, said the delay in completing the review into Ms McEvoy's death is of great concern.
Ms Earley said an initial review under the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, chaired by obstetrician Richard Greene, began on March 1, 2019, and the family cooperated with it in full in the hope it would provide some insights into Ms McEvoy's treatment.
The review was due to be completed in 125 days as per the incident management framework guidelines but it was not until November 2019 that an anonymised draft report was completed.
The final report was never provided to the family or the legal team.
It wasn't until May 2020, while they were awaiting the finalised report, that they were eventually informed the review team and their draft report had been stood down and told it was "on the basis that natural justice and fair procedures had not been achieved".
"It was hugely disappointing and frustrating for Barry," Ms Earley said.
A new process, involving another review team, was commissioned and Mr Kelly was advised of its composition in October 2020.
Mr Kelly, who gave up work to look after the children full-time, said the delay is an ongoing stress as they try to cope with the loss of Karen.
"We were together nearly six years. She was a wonderful person," Mr Kelly said.
"It's tough going but thankfully we are doing very well. Santa is bringing Ruby dolls for Christmas and she already rules the house."

Aidan Whelan (25) thought he was "sticking up for himself" when he told officers he would be returning to the pub.
Judge Dermot Dempsey ordered Whelan to donate €300 to charity and pay €150 compensation to gardaí and struck out the charges, leaving him without a conviction.
The defendant, of Castlegrange Avenue, Swords, admitted public drunkenness, threatening and abusive behaviour and failing to follow garda directions last January 31.
Garda Philip Walsh told Swords District Court that officers went to the scene following reports that a man had been thrown out of a pub on Brackenstown Road, Swords.
Cleaned
Gda Walsh said Whelan was intoxicated and was given a direction to go home, but he told gardaí they had "no right to tell him to leave".
The officer said Whelan was put in a cell in Swords garda station.
He banged on the door and threatened to urinate in the cell, which had to be deep-cleaned.
There was no evidence he had carried out the threat, his defence said, adding that he had since apologised for his behaviour.
Judge Dempsey noted that gardaí still had to pay for a deep-clean of the cell.
Defence said Whelan had had far too much to drink.
He thought he was "sticking up for himself", but instead he was committing an offence.

Pupils sent home with books in case schools stay closed after Christmas

The reopening of schools on Wednesday, January 6, is a Government priority and the Department of Education did not issue any advice to the country's 4,000 schools to make contingency arrangements of that nature.
However, with a surge in infection rates, some principals took the precaution of ensuring pupils were set up for a return to remote teaching for a period, if necessary.
As the Cabinet brought forward the lockdown of other activities in the face of the third Covid-19 wave, a spokesperson for Education Minister Norma Foley said they were committed to schools reopening on January 6.
The first term of the year ended yesterday, but many parents had kept children at home for the final days, in the hope of minimising the risk of infection ahead of festive gatherings with more vulnerable family members, such as grandparents.
Uncertainty
Public health experts insist that children are safe in school, but amid fears that the recent rapid rise in infection would creep into classrooms, many parents clearly took the view that home was safer still.
Amidst all the uncertainty of what the landscape will be on January 6, the autism advocacy group, AsIAm, warned proper provision must be in place for children with special needs should schools not be able to re-open on schedule.
AsIAm chief executive Adam Harris said the system "failed children with the greatest needs during lockdown one, and a second period would have devastating impacts".
He said the authorities must prepare models to allow for continuity of learning for vulnerable pupils if a second closure was required in January.
In a recent survey by AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland and Inclusion Ireland, 79pc of parents stated children would need in-school support to continue their learning, in the event of future school ­closures.
Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN) chief executive Páiric Clerkin said the question of reopening of schools should follow public health advice, but principals and boards of management would need to know that the supports were in place to ensure a safe reopening.
Staff shortages could be an issue and volunteer boards of management may be faced with very difficult decisions if a lot of staff were not able to come to school.
"I could be eight or nine o'clock at night and they realise that half the staff are gone for the next day," he said.
Activities
"They need to know that if they are facing a difficulty, that everyone will get behind them to try to support them."
Meanwhile, as Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced the new restrictions, he said teaching and learning in further and higher education would remain primarily online in the new year.
A spokesperson for Further and Higher Education Minister Simon Harris said they expected colleges would be in a position to bring first years on to campus safely for activities such as small group teaching.
Arrangements will vary between colleges and courses but a spokesperson for the minister said that he "would still expect that to happen".

Salah testing the waters but he is still a huge asset

His interview with a Spanish newspaper expressing his admiration for Real Madrid and Barcelona was the first part of this story and some of his comments will not have been well received by Anfield chiefs.
It seems he was unhappy that Red boss Jurgen Klopp named Trent Alexander-Arnold as captain for the Champions League game against FC Midtjylland earlier this month, while he also said it was up to the club whether he got a new contract.
Then came round two, as his international team-mate and friend Mohamed Aboutrika went on TV to suggest Salah is unhappy at Liverpool, adding to the suspicion that this may be the start of an attempt to get a move next summer.
After the way Real Madrid targeted Salah and took him out of the 2018 Champions League final with some roughhouse tactics, I'm surprised he was talking up the club and saying how much he admired them.
Yet the reality remains that most players still see Real Madrid and Barcelona as the ultimate destination in their careers and the fact that Salah doesn't get recognition in the annual awards for best player in the game might be annoying him.
He may feel he would have a better chance of winning the Ballon d'Or if he was playing for one of the big two clubs in Spain, yet I just don't see how that can happen in 2021.
Considering everything that has gone on in the world and especially in football amid this global pandemic, I don't see Real Madrid or Barcelona paying €150million for anyone next summer and that's what would be required to get Salah out of Liverpool.
He is one of the world's best players, a huge commercial asset, given his popularity in his native Egypt, and he still has plenty of years ahead of him to achieve all his ambitions.
If Salah is committed to Liverpool for the long-term, the events over the weekend may well have been a play to get a bigger contract out of the club.
We all know how football works these days and if that is what he wants, the club should sit down with his advisers and consider whether it is possible.
If not, he still has a long time left on his contract and Liverpool don't need to sell him so long as he is performing as he has done this season.
There have been times when Salah has gone off the boil in the last 18 months, but the flashes of brilliance he serves up regularly confirms what a class act he is.
The second of the two goals he scored when he came off the bench at Crystal Palace last weekend was a stroke of casual genius from a player who has gone to a whole new level since he started working with the best manager of them all at Liverpool.
Obviously, I hope Salah stays, but if he is still agitating for something new this time next year, then the club might start to look at what happens next.
He will be 29 by then and if the Covid-19 vaccines have got us out of the mess we are in at this moment, maybe Liverpool would look at a mega-money offer for Salah.
We know how efficient the club's recruitment department has been in recent years - as we saw when Philippe Coutinho was sold for £142million to Barcelona. It worked in the team's favour as it funded the deals for Virgil van Dijk and then Alisson Becker.
Any player would relish the chance to play for this brilliant team and work under Klopp and if I was in Salah's shoes, I'd want to stay at Liverpool until I was carried out of the club.
Yet foreign players don't have the same kind of affinity that someone like myself would have for Liverpool and Salah might feel the grass will be greener or maybe the money will be bigger elsewhere.
Liverpool fans won't worry about Salah or his friend making these public comments so long as he continues to deliver on the field and there is no sign that he won't do that at this moment.
So for me, this is a story that can be put on the back burner for the next few months and may be revised in the summer of 2022 when, hopefully, we are all in a much better place.
Finally, I'd like to wish all Herald readers a Happy Christmas and here's hoping we have a little hope injected into all our lives very soon.

Stylist who wasn't told client had virus 'fuming'

The Shankill-based salon owner said she was left "fuming" after a client in the salon tested positive for Covid earlier this month.
Despite the client spending three and a half hours in her premises, nobody from the HSE's contact tracing system told her of the positive case.
The client tested positive three days after visiting the salon and several of the salon's staff received the alert two days later.
The client's stylist did not receive any alert as she didn't have the app installed.
When she rang the HSE to ask why nobody had contacted her directly, she said she was told that it wasn't in their policy as hairdressers are deemed low-risk places.
"I am fuming, I really am," she said.
"When the lady in the HSE said that my staff member who had been touching her head for three and a half hours wasn't deemed a close contact, I couldn't get my head around that.
"If hairdressers are deemed so safe, well then why are they closing us down again?
Problems
"We have a lot of people booked in for January as they felt more comfortable coming in when it was a quieter time and we don't know when we will get to see them."
She said she was thankful all her staff tested negative for Covid-19 but claimed there were huge problems with the HSE's contact tracing system.
"What if none of my staff members had the Covid app?" she said.
"We would never have known anything about this. It's just not good enough."
The HSE was contacted for comment.

The 78-year-old comedian was diagnosed with the neurological condition in 2013 and announced his retirement from live performances five years later.
Connolly, known as The Big Yin, said being knighted in 2017 for services to enter- tainment and charity had offered him the "full stop" he needed to make the decision.
"It's been nice, it's funny talking about the end of my career, because I've given it up and it's strange talking about it as a thing of the past," he said, speaking about a new TV show looking back at his career.
"It's nice to come to that conclusion myself, that I should stop. It's a nice, healthy feeling."
On his decision to retire, he added: "It was obvious. I had done everything I wanted to do, and I've got this Parkin- son's and I don't want to be on stage with Parkinson's. And that's the end of it.
"And it's a natural end because I'm dead happy in my skin. I had a nice career, I did rather well, and I got knighted and that's like the full stop."
Glaswegian Connolly was famous for his ener- getic presence on stage.
Symptoms of Parkinson's disease include decreased mobility and difficulty speaking, leaving him unable to perform as he had.
However, he said he did not worry about the increasing impact the disease has had on his life.
"I don't care about it. It's there and I just deal with it," he said. "I don't go to meet- ings with other Parkinson's people and talk about it. I just get on with it.
"I get invited all the time to these Parkinson's Society things, to come and have lunch on a Wednesday and talk about Parkinson's. I can't imagine anything more awful.
"I went one day with my son and we were having lunch and it was less than great.
Depressing
"Talking about Parkinson's, it's depressing. It's just a fact of life, it's in me and I deal with it."
Previously a vocal opponent of Scottish independence, Connolly announced his support for the movement following the 2016 Brexit referendum.
The Florida resident said he thought the country was moving towards leaving the union.
"I think they're getting close to it. They're fed up with the voting one way and getting whatever England votes for," he said.

'I'm so excited, it's a big honour' - Eva gets Critics' Choice nod for movie role

The sixth-class pupil from Scoil an Linbh Íosa in Prosperous, Co Kildare, along with Tom Hanks, Chris Hemsworth, Will Smith, Blake Lively and Tina Fey, has been nominated for a Critics' Choice Super Award taking place next month.
In her debut movie, Eva breathed life into Mebh Óg MacTíre, the feisty, red-haired character in Wolf- walkers, a new animated film from Kilkenny-based studio Cartoon Saloon.
Set in 1650, the film tells of the Cromwellian atrocities.
Mebh is a free-spirited girl and a member of a myster- ious tribe that lives in the woods beyond the walls of Kilkenny city and who are rumoured to transform into wolves at night.
It is two-and-a-half years since Eva recorded her debut film part over a week at Grouse Lodge studios in Co Westmeath.
The movie debuted on Apple Tv+ on December 11 and is in cinemas now.
Cartoon Saloon is hotly tipped to get an Academy Award nomination.
Last Saturday, the memories came flooding back for Eva when she visited an exhibition running at Kilkenny's Butler Gallery that features original drawings, artists' sketches, woodblock-type prints and behind-the-scenes videos.
The exhibition will have a series of talks live every Wednesday until March 16, starting with one with the movie's directors, Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, on January 20.
Walking around the immersive installation, Eva viewed original thumbnail sketches and saw how the Cartoon Saloon team created her character.
Feisty
"We were watching the storyboards when filming and it really, really helped us get into character," she said.
She described Mebh as "very feisty and she's really wild and because she's grown up in the forest, she really has no inhibitions and she never holds back on her emotions, so you can always tell how she's feeling throughout the film".
"I would be quite energetic, and that's definitely something that Mebh is," she said.
"But the thing is, because she's grown up in the wild and she doesn't hold back, everything's just a bit bigger, so some traits would kind of be like mine, but 10 times bigger."
In the movie, Mebh befriends Robyn (played by Honor Kneafsey) who has come from England with her father Bill (Sean Bean), who has been tasked by the Lord Protector with wiping out the last wolf pack.
When Robyn discovers Mebh's secret, she is drawn into the magical world of the Wolfwalkers.
Nominated in the Best Voice Actress in an Animated Movie category in the first ever Critics' Choice awards taking place virtually on January 10, Eva said: "I'm so excited, it's a big honour.
"I'm really very thrilled about it."

Those hoping to play in the snow are in for disappointment as Christmas Day is set to be cloudy and dry, with temperatures ranging between 6C and 9C.
Christmas Eve will be mostly dry with sunny spells, with temperatures ranging between 4C and 7C and a risk of light, isolated showers in the afternoon.
Frosty
Despite temperatures dropping as low as -2C on Christmas Eve night, Met Éireann forecast favourable weather for Santa as he embarks on his travels, saying: "All systems are go for Santa Claus's flight plan."
Isolated showers are expected in the northwest tonight as temperatures fall to between -1C and 3C, causing frosty and icy patches to develop.
Today will see hazy sunny spells develop across the north of the country with just isolated showers.
Cloud will thicken in Munster and south Leinster through the day, with patchy rain and drizzle extending from the south during the afternoon.
It will be a cold day with highest temperatures of 3C to 6C.
Light, variable breezes are forecast, increasing moderate to fresh along southern coasts later.
Tomorrow will bring rain and even sleet in the morning, although snow is not expected, leaving some brighter spells.
Met Éireann is predicting that it will be mostly clear by tomorrow evening with temperatures dropping to -2C with a risk of frost and icy patches.
Some longer range forecasts have predicted snow on higher ground later this week, but at the moment the chances of a white Christmas look to be slim.

Dr Healy (29) has returned to working as an anaes- thesiologist after Dublin's ladies team made history at Croke Park with an impressive victory over Cork.
"We would have been at the core phase, no more than our medical and surgical colleagues, at the height of the pandemic in March and April," she told RTÉ Radio 1's Morning Ireland programme yesterday.
"It's a great job, it's one that I love. It's a great distraction from football, and football brings a great distraction from it."
Sunday's final proved to be a tight affair, but the Dubs overturned a three-point half-time deficit to secure the title on a 1-10 to 1-5 scoreline.
Healy, who scored 0-2 on the day, said she was afraid the showdown might never happen due to the pandemic.
"It's a week that we were worried would never come when we were apart and trying to train separately in April and May," she said.
"So I was delighted to even be able to take part in it. To have come out the right side of an unbelievable match was really satisfying."
Morale
The team spent many months training, unsure the final would even occur, but Healy said they managed to keep their morale up.
Current circumstances prevent the team from celebrating as they would like to, but they still managed to mark the occasion.
"We just went home to our families, which was really lovely," she said.
"When it's safe to do so, we'll go out and have a proper celebration."

Mary Dickinson was looking forward to Christmas Day with her family, who all live in England, but those plans were shattered at the weekend.
Ms Dickinson first heard of the restrictions when her daughter Sarah texted her on Saturday and she "looked at the TV in shock".
"I couldn't believe it. Then when the Irish Government said nobody is allowed to travel, I started to feel very down."
She took to Facebook to offer a seat at the table to anyone who might be alone.
"So many people have lost loved ones and we must be grateful for what we have," she said.
Meanwhile, Dubliner Conor Shields (24) should be back home in Ireland by now.
Tough
However, with the sudden travel ban on flights and ferries from Britain, he is stuck in London.
"We had a flight booked from Luton, but obviously with the restrictions we thought we wouldn't be able to travel up to the airport or we might get stopped by the police, so we decided to just stay," he said.
Like many families, it has been a tough year for the Shieldses.
There was a death in the family last April during the first lockdown and he was un- able to return for the funeral.
He had spent the past two weeks limiting his movements "to make sure we were safe to travel".
He is among many Irish people in Britain who have been sharing their woes about the trip home for Christmas.
Kathy Whitsell, from Clare, was due to fly in to Dublin yesterday.
"I've been living in London for six years and have never missed a Christmas at home," she said.
Despite her disappointment, she understood the ban was necessary.

Level 5 rules needed after Christmas - Tony warns government

Dr Holohan urged the Government to take action to stop the spread of the disease as a new strain of the virus emerged in Britain.
The recommendation was given to Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan at a Cabinet Committee meeting last night.
Considering
A senior Government source said Mr Holohan said: "Level 5 restrictions will be needed at some date after Christmas."
However, the Government is understood to be considering Level 3 restrictions with additional measures for the coming week.
Retail will remain open but there will be restrictions on how many shoppers can be in shops at any one time.
A senior Government source said it is now the "strong feeling" that pubs and restaurants will have to close before December 30.
Another Government source said restaurants and pubs may even be asked to close as early as Christmas Eve.
Limits on household visits may also be imposed sooner than previously expected.
At present three households can meet in one home - and this was to be reduced to just two on December 30.
Restrictions on inter-county travel are likely to be reintroduced before the end of the year with sources suggesting it may be after St Stephen's Day.
The Government was planning to allow people to travel between counties until January 6, despite Nphet warning against the move.
However, due to a significant rise in Covid-19 cases and the emergence of the new strain, it is now expected restrictions on domestic travel will be brought forward.
Shortages
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Roads Hildegarde Naughton said the chaos at the UK's ports should not lead to shortages of goods here,
Ms Naughton said Irish ports remain fully open to freight arriving from the UK if trucks crossing Britain are able to reach ports on the Irish Sea.
"There is no direct impact to supply chains at the moment," Ms Naughton said.
She conceded the disruption seen in the past 24 hours had been "unprecedented".
However, the president of the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) Eugene Drennan blasted the Government for what he said was a failure to act to safeguard Ireland's freight connectivity with mainland Europe.
"I am very concerned about the damage being done to Ireland," said Mr Drennan.
"If we cannot service our market and we cannot service the delivery of our goods from Ireland to the EU, this takes the competitive edge off the country.
Mr Drennan said the Irish trucks trying to make their way to the continent via the UK are typically carrying a wide range of products, from fresh food and fish to tech products.
As many as 2,000 trucks a day will use the ports this week, he said.
An Post has also warned customers that last-minute post to and from Ireland to the UK and the rest of Europe will be delayed.
This is due to serious disruption to international supply lines via the UK as European countries including Belgium, Sweden and Germany have temporarily suspended all dispatches to Britain.
However, all letters and packages previously sent before or on the advised posting dates are on schedule to be delivered by Christmas Eve.

Thousands of high-risk patients to get first jabs this weekend

It follows the decision yesterday by the European Commission to grant the vaccine conditional marketing authorisation following a recommendation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
It paves the way for Pfizer to transport two shipments to each member state in time for the EU-requested roll-out to begin on Sunday.
Each country will get two shipments from the Belgian plant initially, each with 4,875 doses, before larger amounts are delivered according to a nation's population later next month.
The first to be offered the vaccine here will be people aged over 65 in long-term care and frontline health workers.
Each person must receive two doses three weeks apart.
It will take months for all 2.3 million doses to arrive here.
It is expected the HSE will use up all the initial doses and wait for further deliveries to give people their second jab.
"Thiss announcement marks a significant moment in the fight against Covid-19," said Paul Reid, country manager with Pfizer Healthcare Ireland
"This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission for their ability to take timely action to help protect the people of Ireland."
Irish-born Emer Cooke, the executive director of the EMA, said: "We have achieved this milestone thanks to the dedication of scientists, doctors, developers and trial volunteers as well as many experts from all EU member states.
"Our thorough evaluation means we can confidently assure EU citizens of the safety and efficacy of this vaccine and that it meets necessary quality standards.
"However, our work does not stop here.
Protect
"We will continue to collect and analyse data on the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine to protect people taking the vaccine in the EU."
The vaccine can be given to people over 16 and also offered to pregnant women on a "case by case basis".
The EMA said the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trial showed it was around 95pc effective in preventing severe illness in people infected with the virus, including those with asthma, chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.
The most common side-effects were usually mild or moderate and subsided within a few days.
They included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever.
There has been a very small number of allergic reactions to the vaccine and based on these people will be closely observed for at least 15 minutes after getting the shot.
Pharmaceutical companies will send monthly updates on new findings as opposed to the normal schedule of six months.
The EMA has also commissioned its own independent scientific studies to monitor the safety of the vaccine in its real-life application.
Asked about the new strain of Covid-19 which is said to be much faster spreading, the EMA team said the vaccine was likely to offer protection against this new variant.
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly yesterday welcomed the green light for the vaccine saying it was great to be moving into 2021 with wonderful news.
He said detailed plans were in place for the roll-out with the most vulnerable prioritised.

Urgent plea to stay home for the holidays

The call was made last night by Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan, who urged people not to go to restaurants or pubs.
It comes as fears that a new strain of the virus - which could be 70pc more transmissable - may be circulating, although no confirmed cases have been found here.
Dr Holohan and Professor Philip Nolan, who tracks the virus, said that although the new strain could not be ruled out, the dramatic jump in infections was due to pre- Christmas socialising.
An additional 727 cases were reported yesterday.
The country could be heading for 900 cases a day by the end of the month, and a critical daily toll as high as 1,300 by January 6.
"Our current disease trends are gravely concerning. The situation has deteriorated rapidly," Dr Holohan said.
"3,837 cases have been notified in the past seven days.
"The five-day rolling average has increased from 339 on December 17 to 616 on December 21, an 82pc increase.
"It is as important as it was in March to limit your contacts and protect your loved ones."
Vulnerable
Prof Nolan said the virus is transmitting rapidly, "faster than we have seen at any point since March".
"The case numbers are growing at least 5pc to 7pc per day and, of particular concern, across all age groups," he said.
There was a significant rise in patients with Covid-19 in hospital yesterday, up to 241 after falling to under 200 in recent weeks. The number in intensive care is stable at 29.
There is a worrying increase in infections among people over 65 and over 85.
As in the first wave, these vulnerable groups are catching the virus early.
Dublin is now back in as bad a situation as it was in October before the last lockdown.
Dr Cillian De Gascun, of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said the new strain "has not been detected in Ireland".
"But as we know, the variant has been circulating in the UK since September," he said.

€2.7m in donations and a host of new arrivals in rollercoaster year at the zoo

The zoo announced last month that it was struggling to survive after being forced to close because of Covid-19 restrictions.
However, in the space of only 12 hours it raised €1m in donations from the public, and the pot has since reached €2.7m.
It costs around €500,000 a month to run the zoo.
Last February, southern white rhinoceros Ashanti gave birth to a male calf weighing 50kg after a 16-month pregnancy.
The zoo is a member of a European breeding prog- ramme for the species, of which only 18,000 remain in the wild.
Most are in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Kenya, and are often poached for their horn.
The zoo also celebrated the hatching of two rare Hum- boldt penguin chicks in March.
Parents Monica (7) and Joey (8) welcomed their chick first, followed days later by an- other for Magdalena (18) and Patrick (16).
Both hatchlings will join the 16-strong colony.
Humboldt penguins are classified as "vulnerable", with 32,000 existing in the wild off the coasts of Chile and Peru.
In August, a Siamang gibbon baby was born to Cahaya (10) and Luca (19). Siamangs are mainly found in southeast Asia.
Excited
The zoo also celebrated the birth of a new Goeldi's monkey late last month.
"As the baby is just one-month-old and still very close to its mother, we aren't able to confirm gender just yet, but we're excited to find out in 2021," a spokesperson said.
Dublin Zoo plans to stay open over the festive period, with the exceptions of Christmas Day and St Stephen's Day.

The singer said he wrote the track Afterglow last year before welcoming daughter Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran in August.
He is now in the running for the Christmas number one spot, taking on social media star LadBaby, Jess Glynne and Mariah Carey.
"Hey guys. Afterglow is a song I wrote last year that I wanted to release for you," he wrote on Instagram.
"Have a safe and happy festive break and New Year's. Back to dad land for me now, ciao x."
Sheeran (29) teased the release on Sunday when he wrote: "11am GMT tomorrow. A Christmas present."
He announced he was taking a break in September to spend time with his wife, Cherry Seaborn (28), and their new arrival.
"We are completely in love with her. Both mum and baby are doing amazing and we are on cloud nine over here," he said.
Competition
"We hope that you can respect our privacy at this time.
"Lots of love and I'll see you when it's time to come back, Ed x."
Sheeran faces some stiff competition if he has his sights set on the top spot.
LadBaby is currently tipped for the UK's official festive number favourite with Don't Stop Me Eatin', according to The Official Charts Company.
The number one song will be revealed on BBC Radio One on Christmas Day.

'Dedicated ticket lines' for best seat at Christmas mass

A massive volunteer effort is under way across the country's parishes to ensure that bookings run smoothly and Christmas masses are stewarded safely and in compliance with Government guidelines.
Churches can only admit 50 people to public masses, or extra groupings of 50, if the church is large enough to accommodate self-contained 'pods' with separate entrances and exits.
Masses can only last an hour from the first entrance to the last exit, and social distancing and sanitising rules apply.
Last week, Knock Shrine introduced a booking system for those wishing to attend one of five masses on Christmas Eve and three masses on Christmas Day.
According to the rector, Fr Richard Gibbons, despite putting on extra masses all places are already booked up for every service.
The basilica, which ordinarily accommodates 3,700 people seated, is currently permitted just 200 people in four pods of 50. But thanks to the extra masses, nearly 1,600 people will be able to attend public worship in Knock over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
"There has to be an hour between each mass for cleaning. We have a base of volunteers of about 30 to 40 people," Fr Gibbons told the Herald
At the Cathedral of the Assumption in Carlow, the parish has opted to ticket all Christmas masses this year.
Fr Thomas O'Byrne, administrator of the cathedral, said that normally five masses, two on Christmas Eve and three on Christmas morning, would be celebrated.
This year, the cathedral will celebrate five masses on Christmas Eve, (4pm, 6pm, 8pm, 10pm and midnight) and three on Christmas Day.
All masses can also be viewed on the parish webcam.
The capacity of the cathedral is 600 but the maximum number it can seat presently is 130.
"We opened a dedicated ticket line on Tuesday morning last. Reviewing the bookings we have received, there is a good mix of families, couples, and many individuals."
Council
St Mary's in Westport is the second largest parish in the West of Ireland after Knock.
The parish council decided against using a ticketing system for Christmas masses and opted, instead, for a 'first come, first served' system.
Parish priest Fr Charlie McDonnell rejected suggestions that this could result in large crowds forming outside the church on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.
"We know exactly how many we are letting in. If more than 50 people turn up, everyone else goes home," he said.
Meanwhile, a GAA club has offered its local parish priest the use of its carpark so up to 900 Mass-goers can enjoy Christmas Eve ceremonies.
The kind gesture by St Fechin's GAA club in Termonfeckin, Co Louth, has relieved the stress on Fr Paul Byrne to accommodate as many parishioners as possible.
The club's offer to use the 180 spaces in the car park for the 6pm Christmas Eve Mass, which will be transmitted from the clubhouse directly into car radios, has proved to be a godsend.
"It really is the icing on the Christmas cake," laughed Fr Byrne. "We are putting up a huge screen and we have an FM transmitter so we are hoping we can broadcast directly into car radios so they don't have to open their windows."

'Phil pretty much told estranged dad to get lost' - film offers new insight into Lizzy legend Lynott

It will be 35 years next month since Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott tragically died from heart failure, and yet his legacy is still very much alive.
The documentary film Songs for While I'm Away offers insights into the life and music of one of Ireland's greatest rock stars, and will be released on December 26.
The Dubliner wrote classic floor fillers such as The Boys are Back in Town and Dancing in the Moonlight, but one of the few people to know him up close and personal was Gorham - one of the band's lead guitarists from California.
Charismatic
Reflecting on their at-times wild lifestyle together, Gorham recalls how the band's charismatic frontman seemed able to "come out smelling of roses every time".
"When he went into the hospital I figured it was just a blip on the radar, but then three hours later I got another call to say he was gone - and that was a real sledgehammer to the face, that one," he says, recalling Lynott's death, at 36, on January 4, 1986.
The pair went through a lot together, and Gorham was by Lynott's side when he finally met his estranged father, Cecil Parris, in London for the first time. "Phil didn't want to meet him on his own and he told me: 'I've asked this guy down to the BBC studios, but I really want you in the room'.
"We were recording when his father walked in looking super fly and dressed in a white, three-piece suit with white patent leather shoes and a white hat. Phil and I just looked at each other as if to almost say, 'What the f*** is that?'
"I couldn't believe it, and the whole thing was really uncomfortable," he adds.
"I thought if I got out of the room at least these two men could have a dialogue.
"So I started to get up and Phil grabbed me and gave me a look, but I told him to sit and have a chat.
"I walked out, and literally 10 minutes later this guy came storming out the door and that was the end of that.
"I think Phil pretty much told him to f*** off, and that he didn't need him now because he had never needed him before."
Despite the issues with his father, he says Lynott was overjoyed to become a father himself, and was besotted by his two daughters, Sarah and Kathleen.
Cigars
"He truly loved both the girls immensely. I remember when Sarah was born in Dublin, Phil bought two boxes of cigars and we walked up and down all of Grafton Street hitting every single pub and handing out cigars with 'It's a girl' worded on the band.
"He just let everybody know - hey, I'm a dad, and this is the greatest thing ever!"
Lynott went on to write two songs in his daughters' honour, each of which separately bore their name in the title.
"It let them know that although he wasn't always around because we were on the road or in the studios a lot, it really shows the kind of father he wanted to be - not could be, but the way he wished it could be.
"Women loved Phil and he loved women. He was a real engaging kind of guy," Gorham added.

The pair have been locked in a libel battle after Rooney accused Vardy of leaking "false stories" about her private life.
Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie, denies the accu- sations and is suing Rooney for damages for libel.
"The new year could potentially see a resolution between us," she told Hello! magazine.
Sick
"I'm pretty sure the public are sick of reading about it too."
She also told the magazine she is enjoying training for Dancing On Ice.
"I'm so excited and loving every minute of it," she said.
"I'm in the best shape I've ever been in. I'm fit, healthy and happy, and when I'm on the ice I feel exhilarated and as free as a bird."
Vardy said she is even more determined to enjoy Christmas with her children because of her experiences growing up.
"My family were Jehovah's Witnesses," she said.
"I wasn't allowed to celebrate Christmas or go to birthday parties, to attend school assemblies - the list goes on.
"On Christmas Day I had to join the church elders to knock on people's doors and try to convert them.
"I feel like I missed out on so many precious times.
"That's why I go crazy with decorations now. It's almost as if I'm reliving my childhood.
"I want to do everything I couldn't do when I was younger."

'Santa box' homeless gift drive goes virtual

Inner City Helping Homeless (ICHH) holds an annual "fill a Luas" event, where people are urged to donate shoeboxes wrapped in Christmas paper and filled with gifts and essential goods for the homeless.
The boxes are then gifted to people who are rough-sleeping or in emergency accommodation, hotels and B&Bs across the capital.
More than 20,000 Santa boxes were donated last year, but the fundraising effort was put in jeopardy this year by the coronavirus pandemic.
ICHH chief Anthony Flynn said the conventional appeal was expected to take only 10pc of the norm, so everything was moved online.
"This year we've had to do things differently," he said.
The charity hopes the appeal will help make up for some of the €200,000 worth of fundraising it has already missed out on due to virus restrictions.
Donors can pick whether the present goes to an adult or a child, and each box will be packed by volunteer elves adhering strictly to Covid-19 rules at its Glasnevin warehouse.
Donors are encouraged to include a message to the recipient, and these are handwritten by ICHH volunteers.
Once packed, the presents will be delivered by volunteers to homeless people before Christmas Day.
"People can go online and donate a Santa box, but that means we have to ensure that those Santa boxes get packed," Mr Flynn said.
He admitted that getting the project off the ground had been difficult because of maintaining social distance.
"Our elves that are here working in the warehouse are under a lot of stress and strain, and everybody's doing that voluntarily," Mr Flynn added.
Cope
He said demand for ICHH services has soared since the onset of the pandemic.
"Christmas is a happy time for so many, but it's a sad time as well for so many people living in emergency accommodation," he said.
"What we aim to do is try and put some joy into those people's lives and ensure they have what they need and that they can cope through the Christmas period."
Around 120 people sleep rough on the streets of Dublin every night.

'The pandemic brought out the best and worst in people'

It's also the premise on which new feature-length domestic thriller Let Him Go is built.
Defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "behaviour, attitudes, etc. that are based on supporting and being loyal to a tribe or other social group", the concept is as applicable to today's political landscape as it is to the characters and fam- ilies within the film.
"Who knew how confronted we would be by tribalism these days," says actress Diane Lane.
"We need to appreciate the good.
"This pandemic has brought out the best and the worst in people and, you know, we need to help each other and find common ground and cease and desist from making enemies."
Tribalism is, in essence, the key ingredient that makes Let Him Go so relevant to today's audiences.
Undercurrent
Written and directed by Thomas Bezucha (Monte Carlo, The Family Stone), the adaptation of Larry Watson's novel sees Lane (55), who's best-known for her roles in Unfaithful and Justice League, star alongside Oscar winner and The Bodyguard actor Kevin Costner (65).
A plotline that combines classic Western elements with a darker undercurrent, the film, set in the depths of Montana, sees Costner take on the role of retired sheriff George Blackledge, with Lane stepping into the shoes of his wife, Margaret.
"It's kind of a road trip movie with a long-term relationship that's going through something very intense," Lane says.
"As Kevin Costner said, it's an honest movie, versus a fairytale. In some ways it's more European than Amer- ican.
"They want to heal their hearts from the loss of their son.
"At the same time, they're given this golden opportunity to have a quest to save their grandson, which is the ultimate homage to their deceased boy.
"So, you're dealing with a very poignant internal experience, but the external ex- perience that comes at them is more than they could ever prepare for in a way."
On a journey of hope, the couple set out to ensure the safety of their grandson after their widowed daughter-in-law remarries into a family with a murky reputation.
"Where the plot takes them eventually is almost a different movie, which I found very intriguing," Lane says.
"My character decides she's going to intervene on behalf of her grandson because she witnesses him experiencing violence at the hands of the new family he's living with.
"Watching them go through their ways of healing from grief and this road trip that they're on and where it leads, I just thought it was a page-turner.
"I knew it was a great script, so I had it sent to Kevin. I asked him to read it and, he's no dummy, he knows a great screenplay when he reads it.
"So when he said yes, I knew we were going to be in a good place."
At first glance, the film centres on the simple concept of family looking out for family.
However, it quickly becomes clear that love and protection are entirely subjective, as a straightforward reunion between the grandparents and their grandson appears increasingly out of reach.
"You've got three different mothers in this story and you see what makes a mother a good mother," Lane says. "And what does that mean? How is that interpreted?"
After the couple discover the whereabouts of their grandson, tensions rapidly rise as Margaret comes face to face with her new counterpart, Blanche Weboy.
Played by The Crown and Maleficent actress Lesley Manville, Blanche is a fiercely- protective grandmother who exhibits her own unique form of tough love.
"Lesley Manville is so riveting in this movie," Lane says.
"When you meet her character, and when George and Margaret walk into her home and meet her boys and her family, she lists her wounds.
"She announces that she's a survivor of this and this and this, and that's how she identifies herself.
"If that's not somebody telling you what you're in for, I don't know what is."
In a similar vein to tribalism, the film's title, Let Him Go, becomes applicable to mul- tiple characters as the story- line progresses.
"I loved the title Let Him Go because it's an instruction," Lane says.
"You sort of say, 'Is that God talking? Who's supposed to let somebody go?' It was almost like the end of a romance or something - you don't know what to expect.
"Everyone in there could be told to 'let him go' at one point, and yet no character says it, which I think is important.
"When you hear the title come out of somebody's mouth, you think, 'Oh, OK, well, we saw that coming'. But in this one there's a lot of things that you don't see coming and that's why I had respect for Tom's take on it."
Convinced
It was yet another element that drew Lane to the project during the early stages of pre- production.
She admits, however, that she hadn't read the original book before filming, having been told "not to bother my pretty little head with things that we couldn't include, which happens sometimes".
Novels aside, it was Bezucha's work on The Family Stone that first convinced the actress that this was a role for her.
"I remember meeting him at the very elegant eatery that's attached to Lincoln Centre," she says.
"He was in a booth and I came walking over and it was interesting to see what people look like because, you know, when you're in front of the camera everyone knows what you look like.
"He has a real gift for all the different points of view that are happening within a scene, a story, even the genius of the title of our film and of the book that covers so many different perspectives.
"That's what gave me confidence that he was the right person for the job."

A peak audience of 13.2 million saw the comic (55) describe his win as "surreal".
The feel-good prog- ramme aired shortly after British prime minister Boris Johnson announced the tight- ening of Christmas plans for millions of people in the UK.
"Strictly has provided much needed sparkle to our weekends this autumn, and last night's final brought pure joy to over 13 million viewers all over the UK as Bill and Oti lifted the glitterball," said Kate Phillips, acting controller of BBC One.
Bailey, who described his dance skills as "patchy" when he signed up for the series, looked shocked when he was named winner and said it felt "surreal", "extra- ordinary" and "just wonderful".
The comedian, whose dance to Rapper's Delight was one of the stand-out moments of the series, said "What? What?" after his win.
"I had the most extra- ordinary teacher, the most extraordinary dancer," he said of his dance partner Oti Mabuse.
"She believed in me right from the beginning and she found something in me, turned me into this, into a dancer."
Father
Bailey takes the record for the oldest winner of the glitterball trophy from Joe McFadden, who won in 2017, aged 42.
In the series final, Mabuse said Bailey was like a "father figure".
"You just put your heart into everything," she said.
"You're in your world, but I love your world.
"Thank you for being a friend, a father figure to me, a brother and for this."

Consumers may face disruption with new online payment system

It has sparked concern about some consumers being unable to complete online purchases in the new year.
A European Union directive requires banks and retailers to upgrade their payments systems by the end of this month in order to comply with Strong Consumer Authentication (SCA).
The new rules represent one of the biggest regulatory changes to the world of payments in decades and will affect both merchants and consumers.
The legislation requires businesses and banks to build an extra layer of authentication for online card payments.
This means consumers buying online will have to confirm their identity using two authentication methods, such as a password or their fingerprint.
The system is required to be in place by January 1.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the Central Bank was aware of some issues around the full implementation of SCA by December 31.
In a Dáil reply to Labour's finance spokesperson Ged Nash, Mr Donohoe said the pandemic prompted industry bodies from across the EU, including the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI), to seek a further extension to the deadline beyond this year.
"We are now coming up close to the deadline," Mr Nash said.
"It is very concerning that the Central Bank has said there may be issues in Ireland around full implementation of these rules by December 31."
Mr Nash added that the five main banks need to clarify for their customers if there will be any disruption when they try to make payments from January 1.
Compensation
Meanwhile, a majority of people want to see compensation payouts slashed, with four out of 10 saying they know someone who has made a bogus insurance claim.
The results of a survey commissioned by insurance brokers CFM Group come as judges consider realigning injury award levels in the courts, which are more than four times higher here than in the UK.
The survey of 1,000 adults found that eight out of 10 want to see compensation payouts greatly reduced.
It also found that women are more in favour of capping compensation payments than men.
More men than women say they know for sure that someone has made a false claim.
"The crux of the matter is that the higher the cost of claims, the higher the premium the business or employer is charged," CFM managing director Jonathan Hehir said.
A recent Government-appointed commission, headed by former High Court President Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns, found that court awards here are four-and-a-half times higher than those in the UK.
Britain has moved to reduce its award levels since these findings.
The new Judicial Council is due to publish fresh guidelines on award payout levels in Ireland before July 31 at the latest.
The hope is that these guidelines will recommend lower levels of awards for various injuries.

As part of the Creative Ireland Programme, national and local public buildings across the country were lit up, as were Irish embassies and missions overseas.
RTÉ had a special Shine Your Light broadcast featuring Clannad, Damien Dempsey and Sharon Shannon among others.
"In what has been a very difficult year with considerable sadness and darkness, we've also seen the remark-able resilience of the Irish people," RTÉ director general Dee Forbes said.
She added that the broadcast was to allow people to come together to reflect on the year gone by and remember those who have been lost "as we also look to the future with hope on the eve of the solstice".
The annual Newgrange Winter Solstice event is being streamed live today by the Office of Public Works (OPW) as people for the first time were asked to not visit the historical site in Co Meath because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The solstice marks the shortest day and the longest night of the year.
Regrettable
At sunrise during the winter solstice at Newgrange, light shines through the roof box into the passage, lighting up the chamber of the 5,200-year-old tomb for 17 minutes.
OPW minister Patrick O'Donovan said it was regrett- able that the public were not allowed to visit Newgrange for the solstice this year.
"I realise that this will come as a disappointment, but at all times the OPW has to be mindful of government guidelines in relation to Covid-19 and the health and safety of our visitors is paramount," he said.

For most of the year, Joe Hayden soothes his herd of 180 "Baileys Ladies" with Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay and The Killers.
Stress
The Wicklow farmer has been supplying high- end cream to Baileys since the liqueur was launched in 1974.
Following a tip handed down by his mother, he has been using music to relax his Holstein Friesians for years as it is believed to reduce stress hormones.
The cow-calming tech- nique is one of several eco-friendly practices that 60-year-old father-of-two Mr Hayden employs at his farm near Tinahely, Co Wicklow.
The strategy gels with Baileys' wider plans to make the brand the "most sustain- able adult treat in the world" by 2030.
"We play music to the cows and that has been scientific- ally proved to help the cows relax," Mr Hayden said.
"Remember, they're a very, very sensitive creature, they're a beautiful creature.
"I've been working with the dairy herd here for over 40 years and the love relationship is as strong as ever.
"Like any ladies in our lives, what you give, you get back twice."
Mr Hayden said Sunday afternoons are the only time when the music is turned off in the milking parlour.
"That's when we're listening to the football and hurling matches," he said.

The 1940s classic, starring James Stewart, topped a UK poll of 12 festive films of all time, with Die Hard in second place.
Seasonal favourites The Muppet Christmas Carol, Home Alone and Elf completed the top five, voted for by BBC Radio 2 listeners.
Kindness
"It's A Wonderful Life is what Christmas is all about - friendship, kindness and the importance of family, even in the toughest times," film critic James King said.
Originally released in the summer, Die Hard has since acquired status as a festive film thanks to its plot taking place on Christmas Eve.
"As for Die Hard in the runner-up spot?" said King.
"Well, it should finally answer the question as to whether John McClane's antics in the Nakatomi Plaza constitute a Christ- mas film or not."
The complete top 12 list of all-time favourite Christmas films is:
1. It's A Wonderful Life
2. Die Hard
3. The Muppet Christmas Carol
4. Home Alone
5. Elf
6. Love Actually
7. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
8. Miracle On 34th Street
9. White Christmas
10. The Polar Express
11. Santa Claus: The Movie
12. Scrooge
A programme on the top 12 movies is on BBC Sounds on Christmas Eve at 9pm.

'I got the right offer, but I couldn't go through with the sale' - Flatley

The dancer has instead sold his UK properties - and Ireland and France will now serve as his bases.
The star was speaking to the Herald as he launched a special Christmas charity appeal, Flatley's Tap For Ten, for the homeless.
"Castlehyde House was for sale. The price was dropped and, in the end, I pulled it from the market," he said.
"Then, out of nowhere, I got an offer and it was better than I had ever hoped for.
"The next thing the (sale) contract came through and I looked at my wife Niamh and son (Michael St James) and I realised I just couldn't do it.
"I think I am too emotionally attached to Castlehyde. I just cannot leave Cork - my wife and I just love it too much.
"We liquidated our properties in the UK so we are living in Monte Carlo and Cork.
"You never know what the future brings but we love coming home to Castlehyde.
"We are blessed with our neighbours, and people in Fermoy and Cork have been wonderful to us over the years," he said.
Bought in a derelict condition in 2001 for €3m, Flatley ordered a loving refurbishment of Castlehyde aimed at restoring the ancestral home of Ireland's first president Douglas Hyde to its 18th-century glory.
By the time the work was completed in 2004, the dancer had lavished €27m on the mansion.
Flatley's Tap For Ten dance challenge aims to raise funds for Depaul Ireland and CentrePoint in the UK to help their work with the homeless and vulnerable.
People are asked to post a 10-second dance video on social media, make a donation to charity (at gofundme.com/f/flatleystapforten) and nominate their friends and families to do the same.
Flatley admitted he was prompted to launch the challenge by the plight of an elderly woman he spotted on a windswept Cork street.
"I walked by this older woman in a doorway - she had a couple of suitcases and she was trying to pull a piece of plastic over herself to shield herself from the freezing rain," he said.
"I thought to myself 'dear God'. It was heart-breaking.
"But it got me thinking. What if that was one of my family? Everybody on the street is somebody's son or daughter.
"So I decided I had to do something to help the charities that are doing such great work to help the homeless and vulnerable."

The Government is also expected to allow restaurants and pubs to remain open until December 30.
Social visits to family homes will be reduced to just one household on the same date under plans which will be discussed by Cabinet on Tuesday.
On Thursday, Nphet recommended shutting down the hospitality sector and banning more than one household visit from December 28.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan's team also said county-to-county travel should be prohibited on the same day over fears of the rising spread of the coronavirus.
However, a senior Government source yesterday said it is likely the Cabinet will stick with plans to allow people to travel around the country until January 6.
After negotiations with the hospitality industry it is expected restaurants and pubs that serve food will remain open until December 30.
Concerns over the impact of New Year's celebrations on spread of the virus means they will remain closed for at least the early party of January.
Open
It is expected non-essential retail outlets, gyms and personal services such as hairdressers and barbers will remain open into the new year.
Hotels are also in line to remain open when the new restrictions on hospitality come into effect. Nphet did not set a date for when restaurants and pubs should reopen.
Several high-level Government sources said the decision to reopen the hospitality sector will depend on the rate of the virus in the coming weeks.
One senior Cabinet source said they expected the situation will be monitored every two weeks.
Another senior Government source said they did not see restrictions being imposed for as long as six weeks as has been decided in Northern Ireland.
Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Nphet is proposing "significant restrictions" on hospitality and the Government is "very minded" to accept the advice.

The twinkling Christmas lights and hordes of last-minute Christmas shoppers and carol singers on Dublin's Grafton Street were replaced by a dazzling array of festive light projections and shimmering Christmas trees, as the stars took to the stage at the RTÉ studio for a special Late Late Show Busk to raise vital funds for the Simon Community charity.
Recalling how the annual busking session got started, Glen Hansard said: "Ten years, it's hard to believe.
"It started off so simply, and the fact that every year people come back and we do it, it's a really good thing."
He was walking down Grafton Street the day before Christmas Eve 10 years ago "and the Simon Christmas carollers were out.
"They were shaking the buckets and they said 'ah, how are ya, Glen? Give us a song'."
He went into the city the next day thinking they might still be on the street.
"I took out my guitar and started playing. Mundy was passing by... he joined in. Damien Dempsey and Imelda were walking by and they did Fairytale of New York, so we kind of had this thing happen spontaneously.
"Around December 20, I'll send out a text to anybody in my phone book - word goes out to people, it's like 'everybody come and we'll figure it out'," he said.

The two-minute video featuring the Normal People star looks back at what has been an abnormal year due to Covid-19, overlayed with images from past GAA matches.
The promotional video will play on Sky Sport's Mix before the game today and also feature on its social media platforms.
Emotion
It references Dublin's past five wins and Mayo's win in 1951, capturing the emotion that this match will bring to fans this evening - especially to those who usually attend the live games in Croke Park, but can't this year due to the pandemic.
The video opens up with Emmy-nominated Mescal saying: "I think it's fair to say that this year has been anything but normal."
"Looking back on 2020 we have had to overcome obstacles like never before. Human interaction was lost to social distancing and stay safe became the new goodbye.
"If this year has given us one thing it's time. Time to reflect on what matters most. Family, friends, community, everything that's encapsulated within the GAA.
Extraordinary
"During these dark winter nights, people have gone to extraordinary lengths to make this a championship one to remember.
"Our sporting heroes may be playing to empty stadiums but they've filled hearts and homes with joy all across the world."
Speaking ahead of the All-Ireland final between the Dubs and Mayo at 5pm today, Mescal said: "I'm a massive GAA fan and what I love most about the GAA is its ability to bring communities together.
"The very best of luck to both teams in this year's All-Ireland football final."

O'Neill claims she 'never deviated' from health advice

The Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister was attacked after she accused the DUP of working against the executive and public health team in handling the pandemic - eliciting uproar from unionist MLAs.
First Minister Arlene Foster hit back at Ms O'Neill's remarks by firmly laying part of the blame for Northern Ireland's six-week lockdown at Sinn Féin's feet after the Bobby Storey funeral row was reignited yet again.
It comes as chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young warned the tougher restrictions are necessary as inaction would result in thousands of deaths.
Yesterday, a further 12 people with Covid-19 died in the North bringing the death toll to 1,166. Another 510 new cases of the virus were also recorded.
Failure
Ms Foster said the "draconian" and sweeping measures, starting on St Stephen's Day, were indicative of a failure of society as a whole.
She cited, however, that Sinn Féin's presence at the funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June - when there were strict limitations in place - damaged public health messaging.
"Before then compliance in Northern Ireland was very good, and in fact we were the envy of other colleagues in the United Kingdom," said the DUP leader. "We've seen a breakdown in compliance and I very, very much regret that to be the case."
Ms O'Neill had earlier hit out at the DUP's role in handling the Covid crisis, accusing the party of working against the executive and public health team.
"I have never deviated from the public health advice, in a five-party coalition," she said.
"The DUP has worked against the entire public health team and the executive because there's a collective will in the other parties to do more at different times throughout the pandemic."

Planets to align again like Star of Bethlehem

The Vatican believes one explanation for the Star of Bethlehem may have been what is known as a "great conjunction" of planets, in this case bringing Venus and Jupiter in close alignment and creating a bright light in the sky above the Holy Land.
The cosmic phenomenon, which could have caused awe and wonder more than 2,000 years ago, is set to take place again, just four days before Christmas.
Spectacle
The closest approach of two planets since 1226 will take place on Monday,  when Jupiter and Saturn come into alignment, creating what will be the spectacle of an apparently single bright star.
In an online lecture on Thursday evening, one of the Catholic Church's most eminent scientists said the latest great conjunction may provide clues to enhance our understanding of the story of the Star of Bethlehem.
"Every year, people ask us astronomers, what was the star?" said Brother Guy Consolmagno SJ, a planetary scientist and director of the Vatican Observatory, in a BBC Sky at Night virtual lecture.
"This year is special as one of the more popular explan- ations for the star is a close conjunction of bright planets, and it is going to be visible to anybody with a clear sky."
Several conjunctions of the planets happened within 10 years of the chronological point now taken as the beginning of the Christian era and may have been responsible for the phenomenon of the bright star above Bethlehem.
One was a conjunction of Venus and Jupiter in 2BC, which, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "would have appeared to observers in Babylon to have merged just before setting in the general direction of Bethlehem to the west".

Restaurant owners 'deflated' amid fears of new restrictions

There is now consternation within the hospitality industry after Taoiseach Micheál Martin and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan confirmed further restrictions are being recommended by Nphet.
The news stunned Restaurant Association of Ireland (RAI) representatives, as it has emerged the RAI met with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and the Department of Tourism on Wednesday. That was with a view to extending opening hours on New Year's Eve.
In a week when Fáilte Ireland launched its 'Dine Out Safely' campaign, extended opening hours on December 31 were being discussed in a bid to reduce house parties in uncontrolled settings.
Talks had been positive, according to RAI chief executive Adrian Cummins.
"We're absolutely deflated," Mr Cummins told the Herald.
"We met with the Tánaiste and the Department of Tourism on Wednesday and we left that meeting with the impression that it would be January before there would be some form of shutdown.
"We actually had very positive talks about extending opening hours until 12.30am on New Year's Eve.
Mr Cummins insists that data reaffirms the RAI's position surrounding the safety of diners, with Fáilte Ireland guidelines and measures equipping businesses to trade safely, in turn protecting jobs and livelihoods.
Soul-destroying
"It's soul-destroying," Mr Cummins added. "There have been no outbreaks in restaurants, cafes and gastropubs over the last 14 days - zero.
"That's HPSC numbers we are talking and, all the while, house parties are rampant with no policing and no control. I can see and hear them myself in my own area.
"Dr Tony Holohan was on the radio saying that nobody is being targeted by these restrictions, well the overwhelming feeling within our industry is that pubs and restaurants are not only being targeted - we are being scapegoated.
"210,000 workers, 30,000 business owners, this is crippling them and many simply won't return from this - they have been left reeling.
"It's unbelievable how there is no clamping down on on-street drinking and house parties, yet we can't have bookings in, providing contact tracing details, with a maximum of six people sitting in a controlled environment.
"There was a Covid Safety Charter drawn up by the Department of Health and it has been brilliantly implemented by Fáilte Ireland. Fáilte Ireland have ploughed €1m into the Dine Out Safely campaign in order to really hammer home awareness and to reassure customers on the safety of dining out.
"This now has just heaped the stress and strain on restaurant owners and staff who were already suffering but were starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel."
In line with Fáilte Ireland launching the Dine Out Safely campaign, the Herald paid a visit to FX Buckley yesterday on Dublin's Pembroke Street during a busy pre-Christmas lunch sitting.
Guidelines were practiced stringently by staff - and customers - and our table of three was situated safely away from other diners, yet not far enough to lose out on the atmosphere.
Mr Cummins is urging the Government to halt the restrictions until at least December 30, to give businesses a chance of survival.
"A busy restaurant could take in €10,000 per day. Those extra few days will mean €30,000 extra to owners - that will cover the cost of bills, rents, stock already purchased and get them through the month of January," Mr Cummins said.
"That would be crucial to saving these businesses from going under."

Heuston Station saw many visitors setting off from or arriving in Dublin.
Dave McLoughlin, with his wife and child, arrived from Tipperary to visit family in Ashbourne, Co Meath.
Dave said the effects of the pandemic haven't been as bad in his more rural community.
"Living in rural Ireland, our lives haven't changed drastically," he said. "I imagine this year will be much the same as last year. I have a brother in Offaly - I might just chance it and visit."
That's not necessarily the case for those living in the capital city.
"I couldn't imagine living in Dublin or something like that," he said. "If you're living in a hotel room with five other people, those are the people my heart goes out to. For us country bumpkins we're not doing that bad for ourselves."
Joyce Cathal was waving off her friend who was heading home to Tipperary. Joyce will be enjoying a low-key Christmas due to the pandemic.
"You just want to have normality again, you miss doing the things that you want to do," she said. "But on Christmas, people visiting hospitals - that's more important than all of that."
For some, though, this will be the first time they have been able to visit loved ones in quite a while.
Angela Keane was going to Galway to see her sister.
Relatives
"I haven't been able to travel since last March because of the lockdown, so I'm really looking forward to catching up with my relatives," she said. "I'm going to Ballinasloe today, back on Sunday.
"I do Christmas at home alone and I suit myself. I ring my sisters in Australia after the vigil mass, and then I go to bed very late and do exactly what I want to do for the next few days."
Some people aren't making the journey alone, as their furry friends are joining them.
Fabrizio Somenzare is travelling to Westport with his mother and brother, but they were having trouble taking their two big dogs with them.
"They say we can't take the dogs because they're too big," he said. "We're trying to find someone who can take us.
"It's quite difficult to travel in the country with the restrictions we have now," he said. "We wanted to take our dogs with us."
And then there's all the students making their way home.
Áine Scott, who has been on placement, said she was excited to see her family in Tipperary.
"Because I was in placement in hospital, I couldn't travel home at the weekends like I normally do. So I was up here for six or seven weeks," she said. "We always spend Christmas with my family in Galway, so we'll be going up to see them.
"I'm worried we won't be able to go to Galway to see the family, or even family in other counties who we haven't seen in nearly a year.
"For the past few weeks, I always thought the worst thing I could do was come home for Christmas and bring Covid-19 home."

They see it as a missed opportunity for the president, who leaves office at noon on January 20, to claim credit for helping oversee the speedy development and deployment of the vaccine, which is ex- pected to finally contain the virus that has killed more than 310,000 Americans.

The British National Health Service (NHS) posted several pictures of McKellen, in a blue T-shirt and a rainbow striped scarf, giving a thumbs up as he received the shot.
"It's a very special day. I feel euphoric," McKellen (81) said in an NHS post which he shared on Twitter.
"I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.
"I feel very lucky to have had the vaccination."
Nearly 140,000 people have received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in Britain since roll-out began on December 8.
People aged over 80 are in the highest priority group.
A star of British stage and screen since the 1960s, McKellen attained a new level of global fame in the 2000s when he appeared as Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings movies.
Reassure
He was the latest British celebrity to  go public  about receiving the vaccine, part of a collective effort to reassure members of the public who may be harbouring doubts about  the jab's safety.
The chef and cookery writer Prue Leith (80), who presents The Great British Bake Off also posted a picture of herself on social media receiving the shot.
It is not known whether Queen Elizabeth (94) and her husband Prince Philip (99) have had the vaccine yet.
The Times reported they may "let it be known" once they have.
The queen is highly respected in Britain and her backing would be a powerful message to counter anti-vaccination misinformation.

The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has asked the Government to reimpose restrictions on household visits and the hospitality sector from December 28.
In a letter to Government, chief medical officer Tony Holohan's team said home visits should be reduced to just one other household from three days after Christmas Day. Nphet also said pubs and restaurants should close from this date.
Lockdown
The recommendations are made against the backdrop of rising Covid-19 cases since the last lockdown ended on December 1. Taoiseach Micheál Martin revealed last night the Cabinet will meet on Tuesday to consider the recommendations.
The country is already infused with the pre-Christmas spirit and it has led to a rush of socialising, with the average number of contacts of people who get the virus up to an average of 3.4, increasing the chance of passing it on.
People will today be able to travel outside their county and also have visitors to their homes from up to two other households over Christmas.
Professor Philip Nolan, who tracks the virus, said the R number - which needs to be under 1 - is at least 1.1 or 1.3 if not higher, showing how fast the virus is spreading.
"We are concerned that Ireland is now in a phase of rapid growth, which if allowed to continue will result in 700-1,200 cases a day by the second week of January."
Asked if a January lockdown was a possibility if levels of the virus escalate, Tony Holohan said nothing is ever ruled in or out and Nphet will meet again on Wednesday.
Prof Nolan warned 1,200 level of daily cases - which landed the country in the last six week lockdown - was a pessimistic forecast but not inevitable if advice was heeded.
Earlier, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who contacted Dr Holohan after yesterday's Nphet meeting, said the Cabinet will "seriously consider" a clampdown on pubs, restaurants and household visits on New Years Eve.
"The rise in the second wave was largely in younger people so it did not have the same effect on hospitalisations and ICUs," he said, adding that the healthcare system was in good shape this winter and he wanted to keep it that way.
But last night Labour leader Alan Kelly said the public cannot be expected to wait for five days to hear from the Government about potential additional Covid restrictions that may come into force before the new year.
There were three additional Covid-19 related deaths yesterday and 484 newly diagnosed cases of the virus.
The number of patients with the virus in hospital is at 200 and 31 are in intensive care, with 30 additional hospitalisations in the previous 24 hours.
The new cases yesterday included 150 in Dublin, 45 in Wexford, 40 in Cork, 32 in Donegal and 29 in Limerick, with the remaining 188 cases spread across 20 other counties.
Outbreaks
Dr Holohan would not reveal the Nphet recommendations.
He said: "We are now getting reports of outbreaks in social settings including workplace settings, funerals, Christmas parties and weddings."
He said that the consequences of not limiting contacts will be "exponential growth in January".
Prof Martin Cormican, HSE lead on infection control, advised to only meet people "you trust with your life" indoors this Christmas.
The big fear is that many people have picked up the virus already and are unaware of it but will pass it on to vulnerable people over Christmas celebrations.

Feet through ceiling among festive fiascos

Fires caused by candles, tea-lights and overheated Christmas trees are other reasons people are forced to make a claim on their insurance, according to an analysis by Aviva.
Other regular claims from householders result from impact damage to garden and house walls due to cars skidding on ice-covered driveways.
Aviva warned that it sees many claims for the theft of Christmas presents from homes and cars, which it said can be very distressing for its customers.
Cracked TVs is a major source of claims.
The devices get knocked over while excited customers are putting up, or taking down, the Christmas trees and decorations.
Another one is the escape of water. This is usually caused by freezing pipes, which can be particularly devastating if customers are away for the holiday period, the insurer said.
However, Aviva said it does not anticipate that this will be such a big issue this year, given the Covid-induced restrictions.
Property claims manager with Aviva Insurance Ireland David Lyons said that although Christmas may be somewhat different for all of us this year, accidents will happen.
Freezing
"Our experience shows us, that some specific claims have a habit of cropping up at this time of year, with fires, thefts and escape of water when temperatures drop below freezing, being some of the regular occurrences encountered by our customers."
Aviva advised householders to be careful not to leave candles and Christmas lights on while not at home, or overnight.
People were also reminded to be mindful of their home security and were advised not to be complacent while celebrating Christmas.
If away, people should time heating to come on/off to protect against freezing pipes.
Aviva said it is a good idea to leave the attic hatch door open to allow heat into your attic space to prevent pipes in attic from freezing.
If planning to be away for a long period of time during the winter months, you should drain your tank and turn the mains water feed off at the stopcock.
Mr Lyons added: "Our home claims come in all shapes and sizes. While some incidents may be mildly frustrating, there are others which can be truly devastating, particularly those involving fires or water damage."
He urged people to consider whether they may be inadvertently putting their possessions, or even their homes, at risk.

Maggie turns 103 with first visit from her husband in months

That's because the Cavan woman got to see her husband John for the first time in months, which she said was the best birthday present she could ask for.
Maggie celebrated her birthday on Thursday with a small number of family members in a socially-distanced, outdoor party at Oak View Nursing Home in Belturbet, Co Cavan, where she is a resident.
Maggie and her husband John haven't seen each other since the second lockdown began earlier this year due to Covid-19 restrictions on nursing homes.
While she rued the fact she could not give her husband John a kiss due to the "muzzle" he was wearing, referring to his facemask, Maggie said she was "thrilled that we could at least hold hands.
"If we survive another year, we will be 70 years married," Maggie said , adding that she got "a great husband".
Maggie pointed out John had not been well since he had a stroke recently and said she hopes he gets a Covid-19 vaccine before she does.
She thanked the workers at the nursing home for facilitating the bash.
"I had my daughter Mary there and my husband, some grandchildren and great grandchildren," she said.
This is the second pandemic Maggie has encountered but she admits she doesn't remember the Spanish Flu as she was "just one or two at the time".
Family
There is very little else Maggie doesn't remember, though.
"People from the town often called in here to see me to ask about their own family to see what I remember of them and I could tell them the lot."
The centenarian said she had hoped to get out to her family for Christmas - but the worsening Covid-19 situation ended any possibility of that.
"It could be my last Christmas, I won't live forever, you know," she joked.

The Love Island star has been spending time with her new boyfriend and fellow co-star Chris Taylor.
Maura's good friend Molly-Mae Hague and boxer Tommy Fury have also joined the loved-up couple on their lavish getaway.
After a strong friendship, the two revealed that they were together last month after they both shared a snap on Instagram cuddled up in the United Arab Emirates.
Yesterday, the Longford girl posted a funny selfie of herself and Chris cross-eyed with the caption: "Good morning... yes we are still in Dubai."
The Irish beauty has posted multiple snaps of her trip in Dubai as she enjoys herself in restaurants, on the beach and sunning herself on a boat.
In one snap, she wears a white swimsuit with gold detailing, with a cream sun hat while Chris sits beside her. She captioned the image: "You, me, and the sea."
Swimsuit
Maura has shown off an array of swimsuits on her grid, including a high-neck purple floral dress and a denim look with a puff-sleeved white top.
Donning a blue floral bikini in one image on Instagram, the 30-year-old captioned it: "I'm a long way from Tipperary." Here, the TV star is referencing a blunder she made on Michael McIntyre's new show The Wheel.
She has called herself an "idiot sandwich" after losing €10,000 for a contestant after getting an Irish geography question wrong.
On the show, Maura had to help contestant Barry with the question: "Geographically speaking, from which of these Irish counties would it be most accurate to say 'It's a long way to Tipperary'?"
The options were Limerick, Donegal, Cork and Dublin, but the Longford native said Cork.

Up to 20,000 passengers are expected to board intercity rail services from today and daily up until Christmas Eve, as Covid-19 restrictions on inter-county travel are lifted.
AA Ireland expects to see a "flurry of movement" on Irish roads.
The motoring group said it could not forecast exactly how many vehicles will be on the road, but it did say traffic volumes had "increased significantly" with the previous lifting of restrictions.
In the week beginning December 7, 436,699 vehicles took to the road - a 3pc increase on the previous week.
Conor Faughnan, director of consumer affairs at AA Ireland, said: "2020 has been a funny old year, but we've seen when restrictions have been lifted that traffic has increased significantly.
"Therefore, I expect as the countrywide travel ban is lifted, we'll see a flurry of movement."
Mr Faughnan said he expected interurban motorways to be "much busier".
Ordinarily, Christmas commuters would drive across the country on December 23 or 24.
However, due to the large number of people working from home, it is expected more drivers will make their journeys today and across the festive period.
Irish Rail said up to 50pc of all capacity had been booked.
"As it stands, we're expecting numbers to increase," said Barry Kenny, corporate communications manager with Irish Rail.
It is expected around 20,000 will board intercity rail services each day throughout the festive period.
Passengers should also keep in mind that trains are travelling at half-capacity, due to Covid-19 restrictions.
"We must stress to intending customers that pre-booking is mandatory for intercity rail for journeys between December 18 and January 6 - the period for which non-essential inter-county travel is permitted," Mr Kenny said.
The company said it expects to reach "peak demand" by next Wednesday, December 23, according to bookings.
Tomorrow "looks like the busiest day this weekend", Mr Kenny added.
The Dublin-Cork route is forecast to be the busiest one for the company.
Bus Éireann said it has "no indication of a major shift in demand expected this weekend", but its services have been "steady over the last number of weeks".
More passengers will travel by ferry today and tomorrow than on the same days last year.
1,147 passengers from Holyhead and Fishguard in the UK will travel via Stena Line today.
Only 983 people travelled with the company on December 18 last year. Another 1,198 will travel from the UK to Ireland with Stena tomorrow.
Dropped
However, overall passenger numbers have dropped significantly when compared to last year across the weekend and closer to Christmas.
On Sunday, only 887 passengers will travel via Stena Line compared to the 2,328 people who travelled last year on the same date.
Dublin Airport said passenger numbers will be down 88pc over the Christmas period compared to the same period last year.

Mr Trump was impeached by the US House of Representatives in December 2019 stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.
Mr Trump was acquitted by the senate in February.
"I have nothing to do with the potential prosecution of Hunter Biden, or the Biden family.
"It is just more Fake News. Actually, I find it very sad to watch," the US president wrote on Twitter.
His post came a day after Jeffrey Rosen, the incoming acting attorney general, declined to say whether or not he would appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden.
Mr Trump, due to leave office on January 20, has privately been mulling whether to pressure the justice department to appoint a special counsel to look into Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Installing a special counsel would make it more politically difficult for the new attorney general in the incoming Biden administration to simply dismiss the matter.
Attacks
Hunter Biden recently disclosed that his tax affairs were under investigation in Delaware.
The president-elect's son has long been the subject of Republican attacks. Mr Trump often mentioned him in his campaign rallies.
Mr Trump and his allies have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden's position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the time his father was vice president.

Virgin told to refund €3m after overcharging 107,000 customers

It is one of the largest cases of overbilling in Irish telecoms history.
Virgin was continuing to charge customers after services were cancelled. It then failed to refund customers.
It has affected 265,000 Virgin Media broadband and television customers over the six-year period.
Virgin has until March 31 to repay the 107,000 outstanding customers that have not had a credit applied, or which have left the service. The average customer refund will be €33.
"Since June 2014 over 264,703 Virgin Media customers were charged for services beyond their cancellation date, known as post cancellation charge," according to a notice on Virgin Media's website that has been published to comply with ComReg's ruling.
"Virgin Media did not automatically refund customers that paid for charges beyond their cancellation date. ComReg's investigation found that over 141,000 customers were affected by this issue and some have been refunded.
"At least €2,963,895 credit on 107,185 customers' accounts was not claimed back.
"We are committed to issuing refunds to all affected customers by the end of March 2021. If you are one of these customers be assured that Virgin Media will issue you with a full refund to the last known address by this date."
It's not the first time this year that Virgin has been in trouble over questionable billing practices.
In February, ComReg found the operator misapplied late payment fees and lost equipment fees. Virgin Media was ordered to pay customers a total of €421,000. The misapplied fees occurred between 2016 and 2017.
A spokesperson for Virgin declined to say whether the €421,000 has been repaid to customers wrongly charged for late payment fees.
Cooperate
However, of the €3m owed to 107,000 customers in the overcharging case, a ComReg spokesperson said: "Virgin Media has agreed to provide specific information to verify (that Virgin will comply with the refunds order).
"ComReg is satisfied that Virgin Media intends to fully cooperate to refund all affected customers."
ComReg said Virgin Media will now review all credits on inactive accounts and refund those credits to customers by June 30 next year.
"Virgin Media will not in the future allow credit to remain on closed or inactive accounts," it said.
A Virgin Media spokeswoman said: "Virgin Media takes regulatory compliance extremely seriously and it is our position that we are in full compliance with all our regulatory obligations.
"Virgin Media has proactively co-operated with ComReg throughout this entire process and we note the investigation has now concluded," she added.
Virgin Media has established a dedicated helpline - 1800 941 770 - for customers to call in respect of the refund process and will publish information on its website for customers affected by the issue.

Watch this space for a red Christmas on Mars

The European Space Agency's Mars Express has spotted two very seasonal silhouettes on the Red Planet's surface.
The defined wings of an angelic figure, complete with halo, can be seen sweeping off the top of the frame in an image taken by the camera on the spacecraft orbiting Mars.
Right next to the angel figure is a large heart.
The shapes appear to jump out of the tan-coloured surface of Mars.
Minerals
Their dark colour is a result of the composition of the constituent dune fields which are made up of sands rich in dark, rock-forming minerals that are also found on Earth.
This festive scene is found in the south polar region of Mars, with the pole itself located directly out of frame to the right.
The south pole is typically covered in a 1.5 km-thick ice cap measuring around 400km across and with a volume of 1.6 million cubic kilometres, just over 12pc of which is water ice.
However, as Mars's southern hemisphere is currently experiencing summer, the image shows the planet's southern polar ice stores at their lowest annual levels.
The angel and heart features are both made up of various attributes.
The angel's hand, seen as if reaching to the left, is thought to be a large sublimation pit - a feature that forms as ice turns to gas and leaves empty pockets in the planetary surface.
Meanwhile, an impact crater makes up the head and halo of the angel.
It was likely created when a body from space collided with Mars's crust.
The heart is underscored by a steep line of cliffs or steep slopes created by erosive processes, and separated from the dark expanse of dunes below.

'Banks were not bailed out' - Martin stuns Dáil

Micheál Martin appeared to have a brain freeze when he snapped at Richard Boyd Barrett TD: "The banks were not bailed out."
A surprising Boyd Barrett, Solidarity People Before Profit TD for Dún Laoghaire relied in astonishment: "They were."
The extraordinary rescue of the whole financial sector since 2008 has saddled every working adult in is country with a debt of €32,000.
The Taoiseach corrected himself: "Shareholders in the banks were not bailed out. The State took equity."
But in fact there was an error here too, because bondholders in Irish banks were not burned - not even in failed entities like Anglo Irish.
Wrecking
Former finance minister Michael Noonan had wanted to partially burn unsecured bondholders but was infamously told by Jean Claude Trichet, former boss of the European Central Bank, that if he did so a financial "bomb" would go off in Dublin, wrecking the rickety Irish economy.
The exchange arose on Opposition claims that a €3m Government offer for retraining of redundant Debenhams workers was an insult.
"The failure by the Government to ensure justice for these workers is appalling," Mr Boyd Barrett said.
"I remind the Taoiseach that he said he could not put money on the table because it would set a precedent.
"The sum of €18m is owed to the State by Debenhams.
"The Taoiseach did not mind setting a precedent when it came to bailing out banks to the tune of €64bn."
The Taoiseach interrupted to say Deputy Boyd Barrett was "acting the populist".
He said: "I am sickened by the way Deputy Boyd Barrett leads people up the hill all the time, pretending there are easy simplistic solutions."
His questioner told him it had been done for the banks.
The Taoiseach said: "The banks were not bailed out."
As TDs looked at each other in astonishment, Mr Martin eventually found a way to limit the damage.
The shareholders in the banks had not been bailed out, he finally clarified.
"The shareholders were not bailed out. That is not a popular thing to say, but it is a fact," Mr Martin said.
"Deputy Boyd Barrett never wants to hear the facts because he lives in a fantasy economic wonderland.
"If his party ever got into power thousands of jobs would migrate from this country."
Mr Boyd Barrett said there had been no worry about the implications of giving billions to the banks a decade ago, "but when it comes to workers who have worked for decades, who have done nothing wrong, and who are entitled, we cannot underwrite them.
"The Government is just standing idly by while the workers, who are the most decent people one could imagine, and who have worked for this company are cruelly betrayed. It is saying there is nothing it can do."
Mr Martin said: "I said that we would do everything we possibly could within the law."

Taking to Instagram, the Bray native (35) and her partner, Scottish comedian Iain Stirling (32) , shared a snap of a Guns N'Roses babygrow that beared the words 'coming 2021'.
"I've always tried to be protective over the personal side of my life. A lot of things are just for me and my loved ones and we've chosen not to share publicly," Whitmore said in the post.
"However I want to now share good news as it's our news to share - and I'm gonna be honest it's starting to look like my lockdown beer belly is out of control.
"Iain and I are expecting a baby early 2021.
"It's been hard to keep such happy news quiet.
"Especially the times when I've had to run out of live radio to get sick in a bin or my penchant for a bowl of mashed potato in the morning.
Hungover
"I wasn't hungover like everyone thought. In fact, I was completely sober filming the entire series of Celeb Juice, which is quite the accolade!
"We'd appreciate our privacy respected but just wanted to spread some love and a reminder of the beauty of life."
Friends and fans flocked to the comment section to congratulate the couple on their news.
"The best news. Congrats x," said X Factor presenter Dermot O'Leary.
"Congratulations to you both," said Gogglebox's Scarlett Moffatt.
"Honestly, you will make the most wonderful parents xxxx."
Stirling, who has narrated Love Island since its launch in 2015, also posted a snap to Instagram to share the news, and didn't skip an opportunity to make a joke.
Sharing a picture of his game consoles, he wrote: "Sorry to my old babies, but there is a new baby coming early 2021."
The news comes after reports that the couple got married in secret at Dublin City Hall last month.
According to reports, Laura and Iain tied the knot in front of 25 guests, the maximum allowed under Ireland's Level 5 rules at the time, and included Laura's half-brother Adam and Iain's sister Kirsten as witnesses.
"If and when I ever have personal news I want to share, I will be the one to share it," Whitmore tweeted.

Back-up Leaving Cert exams in case Covid hits pupils

The Department of Education proposes to run the State examinations in June, and say it is the "firm intention" of Education Minister Norma Foley the exams take place.
But they have to factor in the possibility of the absence of candidates who may be ill with Covid-19, or who are isolating.
While the imminent arrival of vaccines is an additional tool in the battle against the disease, it is believed the virus will still pose a risk in June.
So, preparations for the June assessments must include Covid-19 contingency arrangements so State exam chiefs have raised the possibility of widening access to a back-up sitting in July.
No decision has been taken.
A July sitting was introduced on a pilot basis in 2019 for students who suffered a close family bereavement during the exams, and almost 40 candidates availed of the option.
It allowed for a student to be absent from exams for a three-day period during the June timetable.
It was expected to run in 2020 but the exams were cancelled because of Covid-19.
Advantage
The State Examinations Commission (SEC) was also looking at extending the initiative to take account of other circumstances that would cause absence such illness.
But excusing a candidate from the June exams has to be balanced against ensuring that sitting an alternative paper at a later date does not give the student an unfair advantage.
Planning for the 2021 exams is being carried out with an advisory group including school management bodies and representatives of principals, teachers, parents and students.
The group held its second meeting this week when the SEC set out possible arrangements for future exams - orals and practicals as well as the written papers - during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Conducting the oral exams online was also among options presented, but some sources did not think that would be feasible because of poor broadband in some schools or the risk a connection would fail.
Members of the advisory group have been asked to consider how the challenges presented by running the exams can be met.
A further meeting is planned next month.
Students have already been advised there will be greater choice of questions on the written papers to reflect the disruption to education over the past year.

Enjoy festive season - a new six month social clampdown looms

Despite the imminent roll-out of a vaccine, Mr Varadkar said expectations of a return to normality must be tempered.
His comments, made at a private Fine Gael meeting last night, suggest the Government will be prepared to clamp down on household visits again after January 6 when the easing of restrictions for the Christmas period expires.
He said it will be the second quarter of next year before the impact of a vaccination programme would be seen and noted that most of the vaccines require two doses, with a month between taking the first and second.
Mr Varadkar warned colleagues that the first few months of next year will be difficult and, according to numerous sources at the meeting, said restrictions on gatherings will be in place for at least the next three months and probably more like six.
He was optimistic that by the spring or summer of next year a critical mass of the population will be vaccinated.
His colleagues were told that rising case numbers were a concern but he said there was no suggestion of reimposing restrictions this side of Christmas.
He said the situation in the North was not good and had not been for a long time.
The Northern Ireland Executive is expected to decide today the timing and extent of any further restrictions to be imposed after a five-day relaxation over Christmas.
The North recorded eight further deaths linked to Covid-19 and 510 positive tests yesterday. The Republic saw six further deaths and 431 new infections.
Mr Varadkar told his party that North's incidence rate is four times that of the Republic and its number of new cases is equivalent to 1,500 in the Republic.
He said the Government stood ready to provide whatever support the North requested after scenes emerged of 17 ambulances lined up outside the Antrim Area Hospital with 43 patients languishing on trolleys waiting for a bed.
At a parliamentary party meeting last month, Mr Varadkar mooted the possibility of the Government advising against all non-essential travel to Northern Ireland - but he later ruled out any outright travel ban.
The National Public Health Emergency Team, which will meet today, advised against all non-essential travel both to and from the North on November 26.
The Government is not planning to implement this advice despite the worsening situation in the North.
Restrictions on people leaving their county will be relaxed from tomorrow until January 6 and a Government source confirmed that as part of this people will still be allowed to freely travel across the Border.
However there are fears this could lead to a surge in cases.
Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally appealed to the public to think "twice or three times" about travelling.
Troubling
He said Christmas and New Year gatherings involving different generations should be put back until the spring or ideally the summer, raising the spike in cases seen in the US after Thanksgiving.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan warned the disease was "moving in the wrong direction" with an increase in positivity rates, the seven-day and 14-day incidences.
"These trends are all the more troubling because of the delicate and precarious situation we are in - as a country, we are heading into a period of potential widespread inter-household and inter-generational mixing," he said.
There were 134 new cases yesterday in Dublin, 53 in Donegal, 25 in Cavan, 24 in Louth, 22 in Mayo while the remaining 173 cases were spread among the remaining counties.
There were 30 patients in intensive care in hospital.

More co-living flats on way despite vow by housing minister

In co-living developments residents have their own flats but they share facilities such as lounges or kitchens.
Now planners are being asked to approve plans for 240 co-living units along with 492 apartments on the site of the former Player Wills tobacco factory in Dublin 8.
Developers Hines, backed by investors APG, have submitted the proposal directly to An Bord Pleanála under the fast-track strategic housing development (SHD) legislation.
Mr O'Brien, a staunch critic of co-living developments, announced last month he would introduce regulations to stop planners considering any more proposals beyond those already in the system.
Ban
But his ban could not be applied immediately as there had to be a four-week assessment period, which is about to end.
The proposal is the second submitted by Hines and APG for the Player Wills site and adjoining Bailey Gibson site.
The consortium got permission for 440 apartments in September but judicial review proceedings have since been lodged with the High Court.
The second phase includes three new apartment blocks, the highest reaching 19 storeys.
These will contain 445 apartments.
In addition the old factory building, a listed structure, will have 47 flats, 240 co-living units and an amenity space.
Two parks are planned for the sites, one on Dublin City Council lands with the condition it would be handed back to the council once completed.
A third temporary park would be provided beside the local primary school.
This would be kept for expansion of the school, if needed, to meet demand from the development.
Part of the factory building will be offered for public use.
The planning application proposes allocating 852 square metres to a free community space for arts and cultural activities and exhibitions.
A café, bar and restaurant and an internal open air courtyard space will also be available to the general public.
Residents will have their own library, gym, meeting rooms and other facilities.
A third planning application is also being prepared for the combined sites for around 400 more dwellings.
It would bring the number of apartments and co-living units submitted for approval to more than 1,500.

Property prices dip but fears of crash due to Covid vanish

Buyers typically paid €257,992 for a home during the 12 months to October, official figures showed.
The number of properties sold is down on last year but prices are generally holding up, according to Central Statistics Office data.
Prices were down by 0.4pc nationally in the year to October although they did rise by 0.5pc when compared with the previous month.
In Dublin prices of homes were down 1.2pc in the year to October while outside Dublin they were 0.4pc higher.
Austin Hughes, economist with KBC Bank, said the October property price data suggested the Irish property market has weathered the initial Covid-19 hit.
An encouraging rebound in property transactions was continuing, he said.
"Irish property prices have been notably more resilient through 2020 than we feared," Mr Hughes said.
Urgency
The lack of housing supply to meet demand has intensified the urgency of home-buying for some, Mr Hughes said.
The official figures showed that outside Dublin the price of houses was up by 0.5pc.
The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest rise in house prices was the south-west at 3.3pc while the mid-west saw a 4pc decline.
In October, 3,845 residential property purchases were filed with Revenue - a 13.2pc decrease compared to the 4,428 purchases in the same month last year.
But it is up 20pc compared with September's figure.
The total value of transactions filed in October was €1.2bn.
Eight out of 10 purchases were second-hand homes, with the rest new properties.
In the year to October, the purchases of 37,168 were filed with Revenue.
Of these, a third were first-time buyers.
Movers account for around half of purchases.
The rest were acquired by housing charities, local authorities and investor funds.
Demand
Prices were predicted to fall as much as 20pc this year as the expectation was that the pandemic would cause panic selling in the market.
Banks and the Economic and Social Research Institute had predicted large price falls.
But demand has remained strong, with a record number of people approved for a mortgage in October, driven by first-time buyers.
Banks and other lenders said it was the busiest month for mortgage approvals since they began recording such figures in 2011.
Good demand and a shortage of properties is keeping prices from falling.
The number of properties listed for sale is down by almost a third this year compared with last year.
Construction sites were forced to shut down earlier in the year due to Covid-19, restricting the number of new homes for sale.
Property prices nationally have risen 84.6pc from their lowest in 2013, said the CSO.

RTÉ delays revealing its list of top 10 earners until next year

The broadcaster has confirmed it will not be publicly unveiling those presenters who are the highest paid in the organisation.
As a result, the most recent figures for its top 10 list date back four years to 2016, a compilation that was released in December 2018.
Asked why it is delaying the release of the figures, a spokesperson said: "Like many organisations, RTÉ has carried over a number of items and activities into 2021 - including the announcement of details of our highest earners.
"RTÉ expects to announce details of its highest earners in early 2021."
In the UK, the BBC released its list of highest paid presenters as part of its annual report in September.
Cork's Graham Norton was third on the list, with earnings of £725,000 to £729,999 (€805,000 to €810,000).
Asked about its own list of top earners, RTÉ said at the time that it "will release details in the coming weeks" and that "no specific date" has been agreed yet.
RTÉ has been publishing its highest-paid presenter earnings since 2008 following a public commitment by the broadcaster.
According to the 2016 figures, Ryan Tubridy was the top earner with a salary of nearly €500,000 while Ray D'Arcy was second on €450,000 and Joe Duffy was in third with €398,000.
In fourth place was Sean O'Rourke, who retired from RTÉ in May, on €308,000.
RTÉ's finances have been under the spotlight for a number of years now, prompting a Government pledge of €50m of taxpayers' money to back public service broadcasting.
The situation seemed bleak in June when a submission to the Dáil's Covid Committee revealed how the organisation was coping during Ireland's first lockdown.
Demands
Both commercial revenue and licence-fee income were down at that point, with advertising "severely" affected.
At the time, ministers were given a gloomy projection, forecasting losses of €36m at the organisation.
"As businesses ceased trading so too did their need to advertise," RTÉ said.
"The need for additional programming, among other Covid-related demands, resulted in additional expenditure."
This was down to the introduction of Covid-19 safety protocols that had to be brought in to ensure that filming and radio broadcasting could continue to be done safely.
However in September RTÉ reported a turnaround in its financial situation.
It amended a previous forecast of losses of €36m to one that was between €10m and €20m as audience interest in its news content soared during the pandemic.
The organisation found itself at the centre of a controversy last month after photos emerged of a staff retirement party at RTÉ headquarters where instances of poor social distancing were observed.
Big-name stars were pictured in close contact with other staff members without any face coverings.
A review by RTÉ concluded that five safety breaches had occurred and staff at the party would have to retake a Covid safety course.

Shippers can only transport vaccines for 2,437 people

The shipper - likened to a large pizza box - would contain enough to provide the full two doses to this number of people over three weeks.
However, a smaller shipper container would only provide enough doses of the vaccine for 487 people.
As the European Medicines Agency looks set to recommend approval of the vaccine early next week, it is still unclear how much will be in the first limited consignment bound for nursing home residents and frontline health workers.
Each vial in the shipper has five doses.
A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the shippers can hold a minimum quantity of 195 vials or a maximum quantity of 975 .
But each person who is vaccinated must get two doses.
Professor Brian MacCraith, who chaired the task force which drew up the plan for the roll-out of the vaccine, said it is still not confirmed how many shippers will come here initially.
It could be one shipper enough to vaccinate 2,437 people or "multiples" of that.
It is expected that hundreds of thousands of doses will be made available over the first six months of 2021.
Prof MacCraith was appearing before the Oireachtas health committee where it emerged that much work has still be to done on key elements of the plan, including on the new online registration and monitoring system and also regarding the numbers of trained doctors and nurses needed to administer the vaccine.
The priority list for the vaccine may also end up being changed, but this is dependent on levels of vaccine and other variables.
Prof MacCraith said there are around 78,000 residents in long-term care - the top priority group to first get the vaccine along with thousands of frontline healthcare workers.
Descending
It could be that the residents in around 600 long-term care homes could have been vaccinated by the middle or end of February.
However, Prof Karina Butler, chair of the immunisation advisory committee, said it may be the wrong time of the year to be "descending" on nursing homes with the vaccine.
She said "we have to recognise" the time of year and it is important to look at what is practical to do with the first limited batch of vaccines.
"It may not be reasonable to suddenly land on a nursing home in the intervening period between Christmas and the New Year," she said.
"You need to give people time to get the information and to give their informed consent."

Mr Foley agreed to become involved in the dispute following a request from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.
The engagement, which went on for three weeks, ended yesterday.
The Government has agreed due to "exceptional circumstances" it is willing to set up a fund administered by Solas, with an advisory committee to include union officials.
It is understood the fund will be used to provide training and career guidance for the workers to help them plan for the future.
The Department of Social Protection and Revenue are preferential creditors and owed €18m.
But they concluded that it was not possible to fund the full redundancy payment sought by the workers.
Sources said there is no cash left in the business, while €4m has been spent on rent, security and other costs.
They said there is no guarantee that stock would recover its estimated €12m cost if sold.
Pickets
The former staff have held sit-ins and mounted pickets in pursuit of a redundancy package worth two weeks pay per year of service on top of statutory redundancy.
They say this package was agreed with the company in a collective agreement in 2016.
The State has paid €13m in statutory redundancy payments.
It is understood the unions will now ballot members on the outcome of the talks.

Keegan Davidson (26) offered the woman €400 in compensation for sexually assaulting her, but she said she was not in court to get money.
Judge Bryan Smyth gave him six months to "see how he gets on" with probation supervision before deciding on a sentence.
Davidson, with an address at Focus Ireland, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the woman.
Detective Garda Maeve Hamilton said the victim, in her 20s, began work on an evening in March 2018 in a booth in a major Dublin store, selling designer clothes.
She saw a man approaching from her right hand side.
She turned to get out of his way and "the suspect slapped the injured party on the buttocks".
He then fled the store.
Injured
Davidson was identified on security CCTV, was very co-operative and had written a letter of apology for the victim.
A victim impact statement was presented but not read out in court.
Keegan had since "completely changed and turned his life around," his lawyer said.
He was "really apologetic and extends his sincerest apologies to the injured party," the court heard.
Davidson wanted to offer the victim compensation.
Judge Smyth said he did not know if the injured party would be prepared to receive compensation.
"He really does acknowledge what he did," his lawyer added, asking the court to "give him a chance."
The garda said having asked the victim, "she is not here to obtain compensation."
Judge Smyth said the accused had previous convictions, though none was for sexual assault.
The judge asked Davidson if he had read the victim impact statement.
"Yeah, I did," he replied.

"It's such an honour to be chosen twice," said Taylor.
"To win this award again is amazing."
Taylor, the current undisputed lightweight world champion, is the first boxer to retain the award, which is named after the female pro fighter Christy Martin.
Bray fighter Taylor (34), who also tops the BWAA's best pound-for-pound ranking list, held off the challenge of former opponent Jessica McCaskill to win the Christy Martin trophy
McCaskill became the undisputed welterweight world champion in August when she beat Cecilia Braekhus.
Taylor had just two fights in 2019, defeating Delfine Persoon in their eagerly awaited rematch before retaining her five world belts against WBA mandatory challenger Miriam Gutierrez last month.
Tough
"It was a tough decision between Katie and Jessica," said Thomas Gerbasi, who chairs the BWAA women's seven-´strong selection committee.
"In fairness, the McCaskill-Braekhus fight was very close, while Katie beat Delfine Persoon the second time more convincing than she did the first time.
"Delfine has long been on the pound-for-pound list.
"Then, Katie defended all her titles against undefeated Miriam Gutierrez, who came in highly touted and was among The Ring's top five lightweights. Katie beat her convincingly."
The BWAA equivalent male award - the Sugar Ray Robinson Fighter of the Year - has only been retained three times: Muhammad Ali in 1974 and then in 1975 when he shared it with Joe Frazier; Evander Holyfield 1996/1997 and Manny Pacquiao 2008/2009.
Taylor, who is currently enjoying a break at home in Co Wicklow, said she hoped to be back in action next February or March.
"I'm not too sure who or where it will be, but I'm excited to be fighting again," she said.
"Going into 2020 I was hoping it would a good year for me.
"I was happy to finish off the year fighting my mandatory and I'm delighted to finish my year off strong.
"I always go into every year trying to make huge strides in the sport."

New strain will inevitably land here as people travel from UK

Dr Cillian de Gascun of the National Virus Reference Laboratory said it has not yet been found in Ireland.
The strain, which is under investigation by scientists, looks set to inevitably spread to this country.
There is also concern it could be a shape that is not well recognised by the immune system, making Covid-19 vaccines less effective.
But although an alert has been sounded, a lot of questions remain about how concerning it will turn out to be.
So far, the fear is this strain spreads more quickly but this has not been confirmed. There is no evidence that it does but it is increasing at a quicker rate than any other in the UK.
Cynical
Figures announced on Monday in the UK suggest more than 1,000 people have been diagnosed with the strain in 60 local authorities.
The virus was found around the south-east of the country.
It was picked up by labs doing testing for the virus and scientists are examining it at the Public Health England lab at Porton Down.
Some people are cynical that it was mentioned by the UK government to justify tougher restrictions.
But the matter is being treated seriously, with the World Health Organisation having been told and waiting for more information.
It may turn out to be not much different than the common strain of the coronavirus but the authorities have learned they cannot be complacent about it.
The coronavirus has mutated on a number of occasions since the start of the pandemic so another strain was not unexpected.
A recent high-profile mutation was found in Denmark in mink, which in turn was passed on to some mink farm employees.
It led to a cull of the animals and travel restrictions into Denmark.
Cases were later found in other parts of Europe.
There is no evidence the new strain is more virulent and causes worse disease in those who catch it.
However, if it spreads more easily then vulnerable groups are at higher risk.
Its emergence is particularly worrying because it comes at a time of unprecedented levels of mixing since the start of the pandemic due to Christmas and New Year celebrations.
This reinforces the need to follow basic measures and to be careful with activities if people who are susceptible to the virus are making Christmas visits.
The initial reading of the new strain is that it is at low risk of having an impact on the Covid-19 vaccine's protection.
But experiments will be carried out in the coming weeks to confirm if this is the case.
If this virus is in the UK it will inevitably spread to Ireland, particularly with the increased travel over Christmas and the New Year.
It could also become the dominant virus over time but this is still speculative.
Anyone coming from the UK should follow guidance and not rely on a test alone because it might not pick up the virus due to its incubation period.
The advice remains to people not to travel to or from the country for non-essential journeys.
The virus has mutated many times since it was first discovered and scientists point out that none of these altered the way it behaves in any significant way.

Office manager stole €20k to pay for luxury lifestyle

Nicola Henry (32) was the secretary of the Johnson & Johnson social club when she wrote 37 cheques to herself, forging colleagues' signatures.
She got €17,326 from 27 of the cheques and spent the money on luxury holidays to Australia, Sri Lanka and Dubai, restaurants, shopping trips and beauty treatments.
The remaining 10 cheques bounced as there was not enough money in the account, Dublin Circuit Criminal Court heard yesterday.
Henry, an office manager with the Tallaght-based company, was suspended when the thefts came to light.
But she then went on to spend a further €3,233 using the company credit card, Detective Garda Kevin Bowen told the court.
After she was charged, Henry "buried her head in the sand" and missed several court appearances, leading to warrants being issued for her arrest, said Kieran Kelly, defending. She was arrested last month and then placed in custody.
Henry, of Carrownegh, Kiltoom, Co Roscommon, admitted theft and attempted theft from the Johnson & Johnson social club and the firm.
She also pleaded guilty to two counts of making a false instrument.
A further 65 offences were taken into consideration.
Det Gda Bowen told the court Henry joined the company in 2011 as an accounts assistant and went on to have different roles within the company, including office manager.
She joined the company social club in 2012 and became its secretary.
The court heard employees who were members of the social club paid a contribution from their salaries every month for social gatherings, with the company also regularly adding funds.
Although Henry was on the club committee and had a cheque book, she did not have authorisation to sign cheques on behalf of the club.
As a result, she forged the signatures of two of her colleagues who were authorised to do this and cashed cheques which she made out to herself.
Suspended
Ten of the 37 cheques - with a value of €35,340 - bounced as there wasn't enough money in the account.
Her offending came to light when the bank contacted the company controller about the bounced cheques in August 2015.
She was immediately suspended and her company credit card was blocked. But the firm later spotted that further sums of money had been spent using the blocked card.
It emerged the bank had contacted Henry about the card being blocked and she authorised them to unblock it before continuing to spend company money, the court heard.
Det Gda Bowen said Henry did not spend any money on day-to-day expenses.
"It was all luxury items," he said.
´Mr Kelly said his client had a normal upbringing, a good education and came from a good family.
The court heard her mother became ill with cancer when she was a teenager and Henry took on a caring role in the home.
Mr Kelly said his client was extremely remorseful.
Judge Pauline Codd remanded Henry in custody for sentence next March.

In the annual Christmas message from the President and his wife Sabina Higgins, he said fighting the virus is based on "fundamental values" of solidarity, care, compassion and kindness.
Mr Higgins said that to succeed in each of these, "positive commitments" are required "from us all".
Vision
"The principles that serve as a guide in our renewed commitment to combat the Covid-19 virus are based on some fundamental values that surely represent the best of ourselves, such as solidarity, care, compassion and kindness," the Christmas card reads.
"Being effective requires positive commitments from us all and we need to speak and encourage each other to have a vision of the light that will surely come from all of our efforts when renewed and redoubled."
A reproduction of the painting Madonna And Child by Italian artist Guido Reni features on the front of the card, with Mr Higgins' poem Take Care, from his 1993 book of poems The Season Of Fire featuring inside.
Lanterns
Mr Higgins' message features on the back of the card, a departure from previous years, where cards would have just normally featured the greeting inside.
Instead of a message, last year's Christmas card featured the 17 sustainable goals from the United Nations.
Accompanying the Christmas message in this year's card is a photograph of Mr and Mrs Higgins, surrounded by lanterns and standing on the steps of Áras an Uachtaráin last April when they took part in Shine Your Light community event.

Vaccine certs may be needed for travel between countries or for social events

At the launch of the National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said certificates could play a key role in the fight against coronavirus if the vaccine significantly reduces transmission of the disease.
The certificates are being considered for air travel in the EU, but they may also be used to allow for greater attendance at mass gatherings once most people are vaccinated.
A Government source said "nothing is being ruled in or out" in terms of how the certificates will be used, but noted that other countries have trialled using them for attending events.
However, the Government is waiting to see the impact of the vaccination programme on the spread of the disease before it decides how certificates can be used.
Talks among EU member states are ongoing and international airline Qantas has said it will require passengers to have certificates.
Mr Donnelly said he expects the use of vaccine certificates to "evolve" as more is known about the impact of vaccines in the coming months.
"If it were the case that there was a huge impact on trying to massively reduce transmissibility, then we can think about choosing vaccine certs in a particular way," he said.
"If it turns out that actually it's a marginal impact on transmissibility then we might have to think about it differently."
Mr Donnelly also revealed the vaccination programme may begin before the end of the year if the European Medicines Agency clears the Pfizer vaccine by December 21.
However, the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine may be set back if there is another surge in the virus after Christmas and the new year.
The warning is sounded in the report of the high-level vaccine task force which said a third peak would affect the speed at which the vaccine is rolled out in the coming months.
It comes as eight more Covid-19 related deaths and 329 more cases of the virus were reported yesterday.
Another 196 patients with the virus are in hospital, with 31 in intensive care.
The report of the task force said if there is another spike in cases the roll-out will suffer because a number of staff carrying out the vaccinations may not be available and the high-risk groups such as nursing home residents would need to be protected from risk.
Approval
A spokeswoman for Pfizer Ireland said: "Our goal is to start the first shipment as soon as possible, possibly within hours of receiving authorisation or approval from any regulatory agency.
"We can only supply countries once regulatory authorisation or approval has been granted and we will supply each country with vaccine doses through a robust process, consistent with agreements we have entered into."
At a briefing on the vaccine programme, Professor Brian McCraith, who chaired the task force, revealed third-level education institutions may be used as vaccination hubs.
Prof McCraith said he had spoken with University of Limerick, University College Cork, Waterford IT and GMIT about using their campuses to administer the vaccines.
Once the main at-risk groups are vaccinated and more vaccines become available in the early months of 2021 it is planned to set up vaccination centres regionally where a jab can be booked. GPs and pharmacists will also be involved.
The chief executive of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, Dr Lorraine Nolan, said it is "simply not possible" to say the vaccine will be "completely risk-free".
However, she said if there are reactions they will be mild, such as a fever.
She said the probability of a negative reaction to the vaccine is less than one in a 100,000.
She said this should be compared with the 8pc of people who end up in hospital with serious conditions after contracting Covid-19.
"The basis of the disease itself far outweighs any potential effects," she added.
Chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the vaccine will not have an impact on the trajectory of the virus for some months to come.

The online trend, called 'ghosting', has already seen one girl hospitalised with injuries in the south of the country in recent days.
A Government TD has also warned that the challenge will cost lives if it continues.
Gardaí are now urging people not to engage in 'ghosting' and appealed for parents to educate their children on the dangers of lying on a road with a sheet covering them.
In a statement they said: "An Garda Síochána has been made aware of a social media trend circulating online called 'ghosting'.
"This ongoing trend challenges persons to lie on a roadway with a sheet placed over them in an attempt to stop oncoming traffic.
"This activity is extremely irresponsible and poses a serious danger to those taking part in the 'ghosting' and motorists.
"Gardaí attended an incident in the southern region in recent days where a youth received a number of minor injuries while participating in this activity.
"Emergency services escorted the youth to hospital where she is being treated for injuries sustained to her back, torso and ankle.
"She was admitted to hospital for a number of days."
Fine Gael TD Emer Higgins has also warned that the trend could cost lives and that it must be stopped.
The Dublin Mid West TD said: "The latest social media challenge called ghosting is on the rise in Ireland and has gardaí rightly concerned.
"Make no mistake, this challenge will cost lives. I implore young people to think twice before ghosting cars, cyclists and other road users.
Hospitalised
"As well as leaving themselves at risk of being knocked down, they could cause a car to hit another car or vulnerable road user.
"Already we have seen one young Irish social media user hospitalised over this and I wish her a speedy recovery.
"I hope young people all over Ireland can learn from this and give up this dangerous challenge.
"Ahead of the school Christmas break there may also be an opportunity for a discussion on road safety in the classroom and I encourage teachers to take up these issues with young people to start the discussion," Ms Higgins added.

Joseph Markey (38) insisted gardaí needed a warrant to come in and speak to his friend who lived there, despite being told they were there out of concern for the man's safety.
Markey said he was trying to protect his friend.
Judge Bryan Smyth said Markey was not entitled to refuse the gardaí entry because he did not live in the house.
He found him guilty of garda obstruction, but applied the Probation Act, leaving him without a conviction.
Markey, of Berryfield Road in Finglas pleaded not guilty to garda obstruction.
Garda David Biggins told Dublin District Court he was called to a house at St Attracta Road, Cabra at 4.45pm on August 31.
An anonymous call had been received that a man was outside the house shooting a pellet gun at what was noted in the call as "demons".
Danger
There were concerns in relation to a resident who was known to have mental health issues and may have been a danger to himself. When Markey answered the door the garda was concerned there may be a "preservation of life issue" and explained this four or five times, but Markey said: "You need a search warrant."
The garda asked if the resident could come to the door but Markey said the man was not present.

Adam King from Cork shot to fame on The Late Late Toy Show when he held up a paper heart with 'A hug for you'  written across it.
Adam's virtual hug has now been made into a postmark by An Post.
In his letter, Mr Martin wrote: "In my speech to the country on Friday night, I thanked Ireland's children for their strength and for the way you all have coped with Covid.
"When I was saying it, I could not have believed that, just a few hours later, the country would see such a perfect example of that strength on The Late Late Toy Show.
"Your virtual hug and your obvious kindness made the point better than I ever could."
During Adam's appearance on the show, he shared his dream of becoming capcom -the flight communicator from the ground - for Nasa.
That prompted a surprise video message as well as a video call from retired astronaut Chris Hadfield, who told him: "The way that you spoke, the way that you treated everybody around you, but the way that you showed us the things that you're dreaming of, I found it really inspiring."
Mr Martin encouraged Adam to follow his dream to work with Nasa, and thanked him for his "strength".
"Continue to be yourself, and your dream to work with Nasa will surely come true."

Google search finds technical fault caused global outage

The technology giant saw all its major apps, including YouTube and Gmail, go offline yesterday morning, leaving millions of users unable to access key services.
The company said the outage had occurred within its authentication system, which is used to log people into their accounts, due to an "internal storage quota issue" and apologised to users.
The incident had a far-reaching impact, as other Google services such as Maps, as well as Calendar and its cloud storage Google Drive, were all listed as being affected by the outage on the company's own status dashboard.
Message
Visitors attempting to visit the YouTube website were met with an error message which said: "Something went wrong."
Some of Google's affected services are among the most widely used in the world - YouTube has more than two billion active users, while Gmail is the world's most popular email platform with more than 1.5 billion users.
Service monitoring website Down Detector also reported that users had flagged issues accessing the Google Play Store and the Google Meet and Hangouts communications tools.
In the midst of the outage, many people took to social media to share their frustration with the rare service blackout, with the technology giant fast trending on Twitter.
Responding to the incident, Adam Leon Smith, chairman at the UK Special Interest Group in Software Testing at BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, highlighted the issues experienced by users of Google's smart home products during the outage.
Dependent
He said that the incident showed just how dependent on technology the world was today.
"People are sat in the dark unable to turn on their lights controlled by Google Home.
"My last two meetings have been unable to use the planned slides as they are stored in Google Slides," he added.
"Our dependency on technology has grown so much, but the amount spent on reliability, testing and quality hasn't grown in parallel.
"Many companies will be reviewing their SLAs (service level agreements) with Google today and realising their business is dependent on a stack completely outside of their control."

They hadn't turned off their cameras and microphones while they were in sensitive consultations about student assessments.
Now the views of the two Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) lecturers on student presentations have been widely shared in video being circulated on social media.
A number of students are identified by name as the lecturers critique their work and award marks.
Several videos have been circulating on social media where the lecturers can be heard discussing the students' performance at presentations they gave online over Zoom.
During their conversation, the lecturers questioned whether one student had ADHD because "he's always hyper".
Hurt
They said one group of students "were so painful to be listening to" and suggested a female student had "something wrong with her".
One of the lecturers said she thought she would have to "start drilling my teeth" because some students were "so painful to be listening to".
Talking about other students who made a presentation, they said: "I couldn't take much more anyways, I was exhausted."
The embarrassing incident has forced GMIT president Dr Orla Flynn to "wholeheartedly apologise to our students for the data breach that has caused such deep hurt".
She said GMIT was "known as a student-centred institute and some of the comments made by our staff do not reflect the values to which we aspire".
Dr Flynn said the college was "taking the breaches of GMIT policies and data protection legislation very seriously".
She added that apologies were being issued to the students directly concerned.

The premises was bought earlier this year and a successful application was made yesterday at Dublin District Court by new operators, Jemi Ventures Ltd, to transfer of the pub licence.
The firm's director is Alan Geraghty and the company secretary is Dee Devlin, McGregor's partner.
Closed
The popular Drimnagh venue has been closed for a major revamp ahead of its reopening.
Along with Ms Devlin, the mother of McGregor's two children, Geraghty is the director of the former UFC champ's four main businesses in Dublin.
McGregor's solicitor, Graham Kenny, served notice of the application for the licence transfer on Garda superintendents at Crumlin and Lucan stations, as well as the fire officer at Dublin Fire Brigade HQ, in August.
The pub licence had been held by Baymore Ltd, of Terenure Place in D6 which had received €2m from Jemi Ventures Ltd to take over the Black Forge Inn, at Drimnagh Road.
Judge Marie Quirke acceded to the application to transfer the licence to the new operators.
The Black Forge, a "wet" pub which did not serve food, has been shut since the first Covid-19 lockdown in March.
However, major renovations have been carried out to turn it into a gastropub since the new owners took over.
McGregor, who grew up in the area, had already been involved in running the pub's football team.
It's understood €1m is set to be spent on the revamp.

Master of Cold War thrillers John le Carre dies aged 89

David Cornwell, aka John le Carre, died after a short illness in Cornwall, England, on Saturday.
He is survived by his wife, Jane, and four sons. The family said in a brief statement he died of pneumonia.
"Very sad to hear the news about John le Carre," said Richard Moore, the chief of Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence agency.
By exploring treachery at the heart of British intelligence, le Carre challenged Western assumptions about the Cold War.
Le Carre's heroes were trapped in the wilderness of mirrors inside British intelligence which was reeling from the betrayal of Kim Philby, who fled to Moscow in 1963.
"It's not a shooting war anymore, George. That's the trouble," Connie Sachs, British intelligence's alcoholic expert on Soviet spies, tells spy catcher George Smiley in the 1979 novel Smiley's People.
"It's grey. Half angels fighting half devils. No one knows where the lines are," Sachs says in the final novel of Le Carre's Karla trilogy.
The Cold War, for le Carre, was A Looking Glass War (the name of his 1965 novel) with no heroes and where morals were up for sale - or betrayal - by spy masters in Moscow, Berlin, Washington and London.
Such was his influence that le Carre was credited by the Oxford English Dictionary with introducing espionage terms such as 'mole', 'honey pot' and 'pavement artist' to popular English usage.
British spies were angry that le Carre portrayed the MI6 Secret Intelligence Service as incompetent, ruthless and corrupt. But they still read his novels.
David John Moore Cornwell was born on October 19, 1931 in Dorset, England, to Ronnie and Olive, though his mother, despairing at the infidelities and financial impropriety of her husband, abandoned the family when he was five.
At the age of 17, Cornwell studied German in Bern, Switzerland, where he came to the attention of British spies.
After a spell in the British army, he studied at Oxford, where he informed on left-wing students for MI5.
He taught at Eton and worked at MI5 in London before moving in 1960 to MI6.
Posted to Bonn in West Germany, Cornwell fought on one of the toughest fronts of Cold War espionage: 1960s Berlin. As the Berlin Wall went up, le Carre wrote The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.
Collapsed
Le Carre devoted himself to writing and the greatest betrayal in British intelligence history gave him material for a masterpiece.
The discovery, which began in the 1950s with the defection of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, that the Soviets had run spies recruited at Cambridge to penetrate British intelligence hit confidence in the once legendary services.
Le Carre wove the story of betrayal into the Karla trilogy, beginning with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1974) and ending with Smiley's People (1979).
After the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving Russia's once mighty spies impoverished, le Carre turned his focus to what he perceived as the corruption of the US-dominated world order.

New strain of Covid-19 could lead to a surge over Christmas

Labs around the country were placed on alert for the new strain yesterday after it emerged it was behind a rise in cases in southeast England, home to many Irish emigrants who may be travelling here for Christmas.
A senior Government source said increasing travel restrictions for passengers travelling from Britain was not being considered at this stage, but the situation was "being monitored very closely".
Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said news of the new strain - which does not appear to be more virulent - was relayed through a rapid alert system yesterday.
He said it was "too early" to say if it is in this country, but he could not give any "false confidence" at this point that it will not impact the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.
Prof Kingston Mills, of the School of Biochemistry and Immunology in Trinity College, said he has no data on the reported new strain yet but if it transpires to be correct it will become the dominant strain here.
"If it spreads more readily, that is bad news as it is easier for people to contract it," he warned.
UK authorities believe the new strain, which is being examined at their top laboratory facility at Porton Down, is not more deadly and there is a low risk it will not respond to vaccines.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan repeated that all non-essential travel into and out of the country should be postponed, including to and from Britain.
It comes as two more deaths were reported here yesterday and 264 new cases, a drop from 429 on Sunday.
Dr Holohan said, however, there are often lower case numbers early in the week and the five-day average has risen to 312 per 100,000.
The 14-day incidence of the disease here is also falling at a slower rate.
He again appealed to people to "minimise the amount of interactions" they have with other people and select the things that can be done and choose those as essential.
It is crucial to plan ahead to minimise risk of picking up the infection if anyone is meeting with older people or those with an underlying illness.
There were 215 patients with Covid-19 in hospital yesterday, a rise from recent days, and 33 patients were in intensive care, an increase of two since the weekend.
Committee
Yesterday's new cases included 79 in Dublin, 24 in Donegal, 19 in Kerry, 18 in Limerick, 14 in Kildare and 14 in Wexford. The remaining 96 cases are spread across 16 other counties.
Meanwhile, Lorraine Nolan, head of Ireland's medicines watchdog the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), said the European Medicines Agency's scientific committee will meet on December 29 to decide if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should be recommended for approval.
It will then go to the European Commission. It will hold another meeting on January 12 to see if the Moderna vaccine should be recommended.
Ms Nolan said the vaccines are being given "thorough scientific examination" and there will be no "lowering of the bar" in granting them approval.
She said members of the public have questions about the speed at which the vaccines were developed, but she reassured them the process was accelerated but not rushed.
Various factors contributed to the pace of the vaccines' development including large funding, the technologies involved and the genetic sequencing of the virus which happened early allowing for work to get under way.
"It will be the most intensively reviewed medicine because all the regulatory bodies are doing it at the same time around the globe," she added.
Regulatory bodies have been receiving ongoing results from vaccine trials for many months and have not had to wait until all the final data was complete.
She said she is worried about false information on vaccines filtering through social media and urged people to get their information from reliable sources.
The two potential vaccines under review aim to prevent people who get the virus from getting ill, but more studies are needed to see if they can prevent transmission of the virus from one person to another.
The HPRA will be involved in monitoring the performance and safety of the vaccine once it is rolled out here, she added.
An article in Anaesthesia - the journal of the Association of Anaesthetists - says that in order for the global vaccination programme to be successful, the available vaccines must be able to do all three tasks: prevent infection becoming established in an individual, prevent disease progression, and prevent onward transmission.

OAP carer stole €2.7k from sick 90-year-old

In the months before the 90-year-old victim's hospitalisation, Lynda Goldsmith began taking money from her bank account by getting cash back while she was buying groceries for her.
She also took money from the woman's purse which was in a drawer in her bedroom.
Purse
It has never been determined how much cash Goldsmith stole from the woman's purse but she told gardaí in interview that she thinks she stole "maybe about €400 or €500".
Goldsmith had been friends with the woman for 18 months and brought her to church services and a church lunch every Friday in their local parish in Taney, Dundrum.
She also accompanied the woman to her local newsagents to buy chocolate and other groceries.
On one occasion the victim would be outside the shop in Goldsmith's car while Goldsmith did the shopping for her.
Goldsmith of Broadford Park, Ballinteer, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to four charges of stealing cash and one of theft of an ATM card which were a representative sample of 31 thefts between January 16, 2019 and April 4, 2019.
The court heard that after she stole the woman's card from her in hospital, Goldsmith accepted €70 from the woman's son, which she claimed the woman owed her in petrol money for taking her to church services.
Goldsmith has a previous conviction for stealing from a woman's purse while the victim was shopping in December 2015. She also received an adult caution for stealing €700 from a family while she was working as a childminder in March and April 2007.
Judge Pauline Codd yesterday noted that the total taken using the ATM card was in the region of €2,750 and that the total sum stolen from the woman's handbag was unquantified.
The judge said it was significantly aggravating that Goldsmith stole from the victim while she was sick in hospital.
The fact that she had memorised the woman's PIN while watching her use it also showed premeditation.
Judge Codd took into account in mitigation Goldsmith's guilty plea, her admissions, ill health, remorse and personal circumstances.
She noted Goldsmith had a history of depression and had suffered a loss of reputation through her own actions.
Judge Codd imposed an 18-month sentence and suspended the final 14 months.
She said Goldsmith should undergo 14 months' probation supervision and should not occupy any unsupervised role as a volunteer carer.
The victim's son said in a victim impact statement that his mother no longer wears her engagement ring for fear it will be taken and often complains that her knitting and clothing have been stolen from her in the nursing home where she now lives.
She sleeps with her handbag under her pillow.
Detective Garda Barry Brennan told Gráinne O'Neill BL, prosecuting, that it was first noticed that money had been taken from the woman's account when she was in hospital recovering from a fall and noticed that her bank card had gone missing.
Her son ultimately cancelled the bank card when he discovered a number of unauthorised transactions.
Det Gda Brennan said Goldsmith admitted in garda interview that she stole the cash because she felt her pension didn't go very far and said "I thought it would be nice to have a bit of money."

Restaurateur Maria Costigan (34) had not planned to go to work but a colleague had an accident, and she had to go in.
Judge Dermot Dempsey fined Costigan €300 and disqualified her from driving for two years.
The defendant, of Ardcath Hall, Ardcath, Co Meath, was found guilty of drink driving at the R132 Delvin Bridge on August 29, 2019. Garda Ciaran McQuaid said he was operating a checkpoint when he stopped Costigan, who was driving a red BMW.
Gda McQuaid said that when Costigan was breathalysed at the garda station she produced a reading of 49mgs of alcohol per 100mls of breath.
Intoxilyser
Gda McQuaid did not produce the original certificate from the intoxilyser in court, however a copy was provided.
The matter was adjourned for legal argument, and when the matter came back before the court, defence lawyer Martin Dully accepted gardaí could produce a true copy.
Mr Dully said Costigan was not going into evidence, and Judge Dempsey found her guilty of drink driving.
Mr Dully said Costigan was a small business owner and had a restaurant in Balbriggan.
On the day in question, she had been attending a funeral but got called into work as one her staff had had an accident.
Mr Dully said Costigan's business had been closed for most of 2020 due to Covid-19, and the judge agreed to defer the ban for six months.

'Bewley's belongs to the people' - iconic stained glass to be gifted to state

Ownership of the decorative glass panels, commissioned by Bewley's from artists including Harry Clarke, Pauline Bewick and Jim Fitzpatrick, has already been transferred to the café's parent company.
It is understood the artworks will be later donated to a " suitable institution" as part of 78-year-old Mr Campbell's retirement wishes.
Heritage
This could potentially afford the parent company a lucrative tax break in the future.
But as an accomplished artist himself, Mr Campbell says his motivation is that the cultural heritage be preserved for future generations to enjoy.
The glass panels will stay in situ on Grafton Street as part of the process.
"Bewley's belongs to the people of Ireland. The Harry Clarke panels, in particular, are a national treasure that we would love to see move into public ownership through a donation to a suitable institution," he said.
Mr Campbell's own works feature as part of the collection, which also includes the decorative stained-glass panels, primarily on display in the Grafton Street café at the moment. The panels are extremely valuable, and are insured for a replacement cost of €2m.
The transfer of ownership will mean that the parent company can now continue to financially support the café into the future.
Bewley's has had a turbulent year as, like other cafés, it was shut down in March when the Government announced national Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.
In May, it looked as though the famous venue would remain shut for good with the loss of 110 jobs.
It had been the subject of a protracted legal battle with landlord RGRE, a company controlled by developer Johnny Ronan, over rent arrears.
But in August it was confirmed the café could reopen on a phased basis. Speaking at the time about his high-profile dispute with Mr Ronan over the €1.5m-a-year rent for the iconic cafe, Mr Campbell said it wasn't "personal" but "very much about business".
Now as he prepares for retirement, Mr Campbell said: "My wife Veronica and I are proud of the Bewley's collection which has been built up over many years, bringing great joy to our customers.
"We realise the need to preserve Bewley's unique heritage, which has become an integral part of our culture over the last century.
"Our wish is that the artworks would remain in the Grafton Street premises and be freely accessible to the general public to enable viewing.
"To unlock the value of these artworks for Bewley's Café, their ownership has been transferred to the café's parent company, enabling the parent to continue to financially support the café."
Mr Campbell also paid tribute to the support of customers as the business navigated a difficult year. "We have been overwhelmed by the response," he said.
Buzz
"I will miss the day-to-day buzz, the sounds and the people, but I am happy that we have built on the legacy of art, culture and conversation started by the café's founder Ernest Bewley.
"This café is the beating heart of Dublin, but also at the heart of my own family with three generations - myself, my son and grandson - working here up to now."
Mr Campbell this year became the first non-Italian winner of the Giotto e l'Angelico prize - a prestigious annual award for contribution to cultural life in the Tuscany region.
One of his most striking sculptures, Life and Death, adorns the main piazza of the town of Vicchio.

The BAFTA-winning star and his wife, Jennifer Gibney, flew from their home in Florida to film the festive episodes at the BBC studios in Glasgow.
But he said making the 30-minute episodes was extra tough due to Covid-19.
"One of the things that stands out blaringly was one of the BBC guidelines - and we had 42 people between crew and cast - that if one person tests positive, the show stops, the whole thing would be closed down," he told the Herald.
"That meant there would be no show.
"We could be in the middle of a scene and someone would yell 'cut' and point out that two of the cameramen had come within a certain distance of each other.
"They would have to be separated and we would have to do the scene all over again.
"Then they'd have to re-choreograph the cameras so they didn't come close to each other.
"Then there had to be checks on the set because we'd have been halfway through the scene, we'd have to leave completely and the guys would come in and spray it down."
Separated
The creator of the hit series had eight coronavirus tests during his time making the two shows.
At one point, filming had to be suspended after a Covid-19 scare on-set.
"We were lucky that we got through it," he said.
"What would usually be a two-hour recording to get your 30-minute show was a 12-hour day, and it was quite laborious.
"We were in the middle of one rehearsal and we had got tested the day before and we were waiting for the tests to come back. Eight of them, including my own, were 'inconclusive'.
"Everybody was immediately sent to their dressing room and locked in.
"We had to wait and be retested, and it all came back negative."
O'Carroll said there was an emotional moment when the two episodes were finally completed.
"I nearly cried when we finished the final scene and they said, 'That's it; we're done'. I got such a sense of achievement.
"I went 'there's going to be a Mrs Brown's on Christmas Day' and it was a weird feeling," he said.
"People really need a laugh at the end of 2020."
Airing on RTÉ and BBC on Christmas Day and New Year's Eve, O'Carroll said there will be a "different" feel to the two shows this year but all the usual characters will be returning as viewers see how Mrs Brown and her crew are coping with life under lockdown.
Earnings
O'Carroll and his wife are keeping to their tradition of giving out Christmas Day dinners to disadvantaged families, as they do every year with St Vincent de Paul.
This year, they will help 2,482 families, who will each receive a Christmas card from Mrs Brown and a credit card to buy a turkey to feed seven people, a ham, a bottle of wine and treats for the kids.
"We've had no earnings this year, but we knew we had committed ourselves to doing it and it's going to be the same this year," he said.

33k new homes a year needed 'but Covid may slow demand'
The Herald (Ireland)
December 14, 2020

Research from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) for the Department of Housing says that Ireland may need to build as many as 33,000 new homes a year to meet demand.
That is well above the 25,000 figure used in the National Planning Framework and points to a potential worsening of the current crisis.
However, the report suggests the country's housing needs over the next two decades could vary widely depending on the rate of inward migration - which it sees as the key driver of housing demand.
Surge
The higher estimate for housing is based on the population hitting around six million.
Even a less extreme so-called base-line scenario sees a need for 28,000 new homes a year, based on a rise in population by 925,000 between now and 2040.
ESRI researchers think the bulk of the new population, 514,000 people, will be concentrated in and around Dublin and will be the engine of a surge in housing demand in the east and midlands.
That concentrated demand might soften if planning and economic policies manage to shift more population growth to the other cities,.
But even if this is achieved, 50pc of the expansion would still be in Dublin and the surrounding commuter counties with relatively more growth in Limerick, Cork and Galway in particular.
Even so, with housing completions languishing this year at just 20,000 new homes, the ESRI figures suggest the gap between supply and demand is set to continue and even worsen the current housing crisis, driving up prices and rents. However, ESRI research says the need for housing could be far lower - 26,000 a year - if inward migration slows. One reason given is the knock-on effect of Covid-19.
"It is likely that travel restrictions, uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic and lower confidence may result in migration being lower than in the baseline scenario, at least in the short term," the ESRI report says.
That could mean migration into Ireland falling from 33,700 in 2019 to just 5,000 a year.
"The longer the pandemic and measures to contain it persist, the more likely estimates of structural housing demand will be closer to those in the low international migration scenario," it said.
Investment
While that would dampen housing demand, it would in all likelihood only happen if the economic recovery from the pandemic was slow or weak, which could well mean less investment in housing.
Meanwhile, new data from Ulster Bank chief economist Simon Barry - who tracks the construction sector month by month using an index based on a survey of purchasing managers (PMI) - suggests building supply is set to speed up.
"The latest results of the Ulster Bank Construction PMI survey provided encouraging signals in a number of respects," he said.
Activity on sites returned to growth in November, and new orders - a strong indicator of future activity - was at a 19-month high.
"The November results also showed a further sharp strengthening of optimism about the year ahead where sentiment rose to its highest level since February 2020 as confidence is being underpinned by expectations that 2021 will see activity pick-up following a year marked by significant pandemic-related disruption," Mr Barry said.

An oral history project, a re-enactment of the "storming" of Dublin Castle by the new Civic Guard, and the special award of a commemorative coin and ribbon to all serving members are on the cards.
News of the effort comes after a weekend recognising the centenary of the burning of Cork by Auxiliaries to the RIC.
Independent TD Joan Collins said yesterday the State attempt to commemorate the RIC had been insensitive and all anniversary commemorations would have to be respectful of all views.
A special committee chaired by a senior officer will coordinate the commemorations within the organisation.
Two significant events are planned, one on February 7, 2022, marking the meeting at the Gresham Hotel, Dublin where the decision to form the Civic Guard was taken.
The other will be in August to commemorate the storming of Dublin Castle by the Garda commissioner on August 17, 1922, when the Civic Guard took control of the former seat of British administration in Ireland.
The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors believes a commemorative medal could also be struck and presented to every serving member for members of the Defence Forces in 2016.
"Any ideas of merit would certainly be given consideration," said Minister of State at the Department of Justice James Browne.
The Garda Síochána Retired Members Association wants an oral history project to be considered, pointing out a similar project is taking place in the Military Archives in Cathal Brugha Barracks.
Some of this testimony and eyewitness accounts could involve anti-subversive operations over recent decades.

Gerard Cruise (47), of Rathmullen Park, Drogheda, was formally charged at Dundalk District Court.
Detective Sergeant Peter Cooney told Judge Eirinn McKiernan that he arrested Mr Cruise at 12.18am yesterday and charged him at 12.50am at Drogheda garda station with the murder.
The victim cannot be named because of a recent ruling in the Court of Appeal which prohibits the naming of child murder victims.
Det Sgt Cooney said Mr Cruise made no reply when charged.
No application was made for bail as a person charged with murder has to apply for bail to the High Court.
Judge McKiernan remanded the accused in custody in Cloverhill Prison from where he will appear before Drogheda District Court on Friday via video link. There were angry scenes at the courthouse when Mr Cruise arrived there in a garda van under escort.
A small gathering of people shouted abuse as the van was driven down a side lane and through a back gate into a yard behind the court building.
The accused sat quietly during the short hearing.
Disability
His solicitor, Eleanor Kelly, applied for legal aid, telling Judge McKiernan her client is on disability allowance.
She also asked that medical attention be given to Mr Cruise if it was required while he was in custody. Both requests were granted.
He was driven away from the court under armed escort by members of the garda armed response unit.

Baby boom in early 2000s feeding huge CAO surge

The figure is 2,000 ahead of where it was this time last year and currently stands at more than 21,000.
The ongoing rise in Leaving Cert candidates, on the back of the baby boom in the early 2000s, is likely a key factor.
The early rush may also reflect the push to encourage students to get started well ahead of deadlines because of uncertainty around future lockdowns and restrictions.
This is aimed particularly at those applying for the DARE and HEAR schemes - which offer entry on reduced points to students with a disadvantage - who have to gather supporting documentation.
Covid may also be triggering a bounce in interest from mature applicants seeking a new career direction.
As the Leaving Cert class of 2021, and others, turn their thoughts to college entry, there is now a prospect of improved student grant supports, starting from next September.
Further and Higher Education Minister Simon Harris said there was likely to be an increase in grant holders next year as a result of the pandemic.
Approval
He announced details of a wide-ranging review of the Susi grants scheme, following formal Government approval of the terms of reference.
Consultants will be appointed and the report is expected next summer.
The minister hopes to be in a position to introduce some changes in the 2021/22 academic year; however, it is likely that more significant reforms will come in 2022.
The review will examine grant values and the income thresholds for eligibility, rates paid depending on distance from a student's home to college, definition of an approved course, including part-time courses, and supports for post-graduate students.
It will also look at the overall "real" cost of further and higher education and will compare supports for students in Ireland with what is offered in other countries.
Mr Harris said the scheme opened the door for many people to access further and higher education, but it had remained static despite significant changes within Irish society.
"We are likely to see an increase in grant holders next year as a result of the pandemic," said Mr Harris.
"I want this review to consider the challenges facing students and to find out what we can do better."

Driver repeatedly stole petrol from 2 service stations

Martin Maughan (48) stole more than €500 worth of petrol from the Applegreen service stations on the M1 over five weeks in 2018.
Judge Dermot Dempsey imposed a nine-month sentence, concurrent to a lengthy sentence Maughan is already serving.
The defendant, who is not due for release until 2022, has only seen his family three times this year, due to Covid-19 restrictions, and he had struggled to maintain his relationships with them, his lawyer said.
The defendant, with an address at St Margaret's Park in Ballymun, admitted seven counts of failing to pay for petrol. The thefts all occurred at the two Applegreen stations on the M1 on dates between August 31, 2018 and October 1, 2018.
Dysfunctional
The total value of the petrol was €539, and on each occasion Maughan filled up his vehicle before driving off without paying, Garda Brendan Fitzpatrick told Swords District Court.
The court heard that Maughan had 237 previous convictions.
Defence lawyer Deirdre Flannery said Maughan had a dysfunctional upbringing and had regularly gotten into trouble.
Ms Flannery said these incidents all took place within a short period and Maughan had been in custody ever since.
She said Maughan had been clean of drugs for nearly two years and was involved with the Red Cross in prison.
Ms Flannery said Maughan was married and had one child. He had only seen his family three times this year and it had been difficult to maintain his relationships with them.
Ms Flannery asked the judge not to increase Maughan's time in custody, adding he hoped to start afresh when he left prison.

"I will shortly seek the approval of the Government for a judicial appointments commission bill, providing for the establishment of a new commission to replace the JAAB," Ms McEntee said.
"The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reforming the judicial appointments process and I intend to bring forward new legislation to do this very quickly."
There are currently three vacancies on the national courts: one on the Supreme Court, one on a Circuit Court and one on a District Court.
The vacancies on the Circuit and District Courts will be filled as soon as possible, Ms McEntee said, while it is practice to maintain a vacancy on the Supreme Court due to the reduction in waiting times achieved there in recent years.
Urgent
She said that at a meeting with the Chief Justice last week, he had "restated to me that there was no urgent need for this vacancy to be filled".
The minister said the lower court vacancies would be filled in the meantime.
A request will be made to JAAB for a list of candidates for appointment and the names of all those who applied, she said.
"The JAAB recommendations are considered along with any expressions of interest from serving judges and all judges eligible for appointment," Ms McEntee said.
"I then submit a memorandum for Government to the Cabinet agenda, at which point the Cabinet agrees on a nominee for appointment by the President."
She said she was committed to creating a new commission to replace the JAAB "as quickly as possible".
"It needs reform," she said.
"It is important that we pass new legislation as quickly as possible, but people must have confidence in this process."

€20m to be spent on chasing down M50 toll dodgers

Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is currently seeking tenders from companies to provide debt-collection and enforcement services in circumstances where motorists fail to pay tolls accrued on the motorway's 'eFlow' system.
The estimated value of the contract is €20m over a six-year period, according to the tender documents.
The service is currently provided by Pierse Fitzgibbon Solicitors in Listowel, Co Kerry.
Barrier-free tolling was introduced on the M50 in 2008 in a bid to alleviate traffic congestion as a result of long queues at the toll plaza.
The electronic system allows for the application of tolls without vehicles having to stop or slow down.
Unregistered motorists have until 8pm the following day to pay the relevant charges.
Failure to pay results in additional penalties, after which an "evidence pack" on each case is handed to the enforcement contractor.
It then pursues a number of legal debt-collection actions on behalf of TII.
Criminal
These include issuing legal demand letters, followed by pre-legal letters or draft claim notices.
The contractor is also responsible for conducting criminal and civil legal proceedings against offending motorists.
The service provider will also be expected to carry out debt-collection procedures in accordance with court judgements, according to the tender.
TII anticipates that between 14,000 and 18,000 legal demand letters will be issued each month under the new contract, along with 2,000 draft claim notices. Around 50 criminal summonses will be issued each month.
Tolling income from the M50 was €158m last year, according to the latest TII annual report.
Around €9m of this related to default tolls or penalties.
A spokesman for the roads authority said that revenue from TII's toll business pays for the M50 upgrade, maintenance and operation of the motorway, and contributes to the maintenance of the wider national roads network.
The new contract for an enforcement services provider is expected to be awarded to the successful tenderer next year with a view to commencing operations in June 2021.

'I didn't make this film for the Irish people', says director of Wild Mountain Thyme movie

A trailer of the blockbuster romance film was met with widespread derision due to some of the imagery and accents of stars Emily Blunt and Jamie Dornan.
But director John Patrick Shanley has taken the criticism in his stride.
In an interview with Variety, Mr Shanley said "no good will come from" trying to get the Irish to love you.
Violent
He compared himself to John Millington Synge and Frank McCourt, whose works drew criticism for their depiction of Ireland as impoverished and its people as primitive and violent.
"I told Emily (Blunt) when we first talked about this project, 'I'm not making this movie for the Irish'.
"If you try to get the Irish to love you, no good will come of it.
"I'm making this movie for everybody else and all the people who want to go to Ireland.
"The Irish reaction to things written about Ireland has been tumultuous from the time of John Millington Synge, when Playboy of the Western World was disrupted because people thought that it was pornographic.
"Frank McCourt was a friend of mine and he took a lot of guff for Angela's Ashes.
"You bring up The Quiet Man to people there and it's like Jesus Christ, it's an abomination.
"That's about as much as I can say about it," he said.
Mr Shanley went on to suggest the dialogue which saw Emily Blunt scream in a fierce pitched brogue - "It was HE that kissed ME" - was "how farmers talk".
"The language of Ireland is akin to the soil of Ireland. It is absolutely central to the identity of the Irish people.
"It's very much appropriate to celebrate the fabulous way that these farmers talk."
In the interview, Mr Shanley spoke about filming in "beautiful' Mayo with its unpredictable weather.
"It's always a fluid thing when you direct a film. You're dealing with the facts on the ground on a daily basis and, of course, there was the changeable weather of County Mayo, and I was working with a lot of animals," he said.
"The audience wants to be taken somewhere they've never been before. Most of us don't get to live on a farm in western Ireland."
Dancing
Mr Shanley firmly stated his own Irish credentials and recalled his aunts dancing around the living room to the accordion.
"My father didn't come to America until he was 24. He grew up on a farm in central Ireland that's still in my family to this day," he said.
"When I sat down in the Shanley family kitchen and listened to people talk.
"I couldn't believe the level of conversation. It was gorgeous.
"My father played the accordion in the living room and sang and my aunts danced in the living room.
"Both of my mother's parents were from Ireland. So, I'm pretty freaking Irish."

The actress, one of Britain's most beloved entertainment stars, first found fame in her role as a buxom blonde in the Carry On films and later became a household name playing Peggy Mitchell, the Queen Vic's battle-axe landlady in BBC soap EastEnders.
Windsor was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2014 and made the news public in 2018.
Cherished
She died at 8.35pm on Thursday at a London care home, her husband Scott Mitchell said. He said the cherished actress's final weeks were "typical of how she lived her life" and "full of humour, drama and a fighting spirit until the end".
"Her passing was from Alzheimer's/dementia and Barbara eventually died peacefully and I spent the last seven days by her side," Mr Mitchell said.
"Myself, her family and friends will remember Barbara with love, a smile and affection for the many years of her love, fun, friendship and brightness she brought to all our lives and the entertainment she gave to so many thousands of others during her career.
"Barbara's final weeks were typical of how she lived her life. Full of humour, drama and a fighting spirit until the end.
"It was not the ending that Barbara or anyone else living with this very cruel disease deserve.
"I will always be immensely proud of Barbara's courage, dignity and generosity dealing with her own illness and still trying to help others by raising awareness for as long as she could."
Mr Mitchell, who alongside his wife campaigned for greater dementia care from the British government, added: "Dementia/Alzheimer's remains the UKs number one killer. Although in challenging times, I urge the Prime Minister, his government and other parties to be true to their previous promises and invest more into dementia/Alzheimer's research and care.
"Thank you to all the doctors, nurses and carers who are angels at the care home for your kindness and care to Barbara and I throughout her stay with you. You are my heroes.
"And my gratitude to our family, friends and everyone in the media and the general public for all the good wishes and warm support that has been shown to Barbara over the last few years during her illness. Barbara deeply appreciated that."
At the end of his moving tribute, Mr Mitchell said: "May you rest in peace now my precious Bar. I've lost my wife, my best friend and soul mate and my heart or life will never feel the same without you.
"I will be making no further statements and now need the time to grieve this painful, personal loss."
Windsor made her debut as Peggy in 1994 and soon became one of the small screen's best-loved characters as she yelled at rogue drinkers to "get outta my pub!".
It became the defining role of her career and saw her star alongside Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden as her fictional sons Grant and Phil, with the late Mike Reid as her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.
The character left our screens in 2003 when Windsor took a sabbatical for medical reasons after being diagnosed with the Epstein-Barr virus, but she returned as a series regular in 2005.
Married
In 2009, the actress announced she would be leaving the soap again in order to spend more time with her husband Scott, who she married in 2000.
She returned for cameo appearances in the soap over the next few years but in 2016 she played Peggy for the final time.
Her final scenes aired in May that year as the Walford stalwart took her own life after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.
Born in Shoreditch, London, in 1937, Windsor launched her showbiz career early, making her stage debut at 13 and her West End debut in 1952.

US-based pharmaceutical company Viatris announced 440 jobs are to go at the company's plant in Baldoyle as part of a major restructuring plan.
The company, which employs 45,000 people worldwide, announced that five of its plants around the world will be affected.
It confirmed that its Baldoyle operation would be among them.
The company said it intends to "close, downsize or divest" up to 15 manufacturing facilities globally that are deemed to be "no longer viable either due to surplus capacity, challenging market dynamics or a shift in its product portfolio toward more complex products".
The company said it expects that 20pc of its current workforce of around 9,000 employees will be affected by the streamlining.
Viatris was formed out of a merger between pharmaceutical giants Mylan and Upjohn, Pfizer's off-patent medicine division, just last month.
The Mylan plant in Baldoyle is an oral solid-dose medicine manufacturer. The firm could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Employment Minister Leo Varadkar said last night: "This is really devastating news for those working in Viatris and their families. It has been an exceptionally difficult year for everyone.
Committed
"This will come as another blow, especially so close to Christmas, although I am assured that there will be no immediate reductions and that the majority of the workforce will remain employed until late 2022.
"I understand that this development is not related to Covid-19, but instead related to a global restructuring.
"Despite this disappointing decision, Viatris has made it clear that it remains fully committed to Ireland and even after this announcement they will employ more than 1,400 across the country."

The Democratic former vice president and his running mate, a California senator whose election broke gender and racial barriers, together "offered restoration and renewal in a single ticket", Time said in a profile of the pair.
"America bought what they were selling: after the highest voter turnout in a century, they racked up 81 million votes and counting, the most in presidential history, topping Trump by some 7 million votes and flipping five battleground states," Time wrote.
Donald Trump, the 45th US president and Time's 2016 Person of the Year was among three other finalists in the running this year, Time said.
The two others, both group candidates, were the healthcare workers battling the Covid-19 pandemic, and participants in the racial justice movement sparked by the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The Person of the Year is usually an individual, but multiple people have been named in the past.
The title is one, according to the magazine, signifying "who affected the news or our lives the most, for better, or worse".
Time began its tradition in 1927. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg last year became the youngest individual winner of the accolade.
Stolen
Mr Biden (78), who served two terms as vice president to Barack Obama, will become the oldest person to assume the office of US president when he is sworn in on January 20.
Harris will become the first woman, the first black and the first person of Asian descent to be inaugurated vice president.
Mr Trump, who has continued to claim the 2020 election was stolen from him, is not expected to attend the inauguration.
Time magazine also named the Korean pop group BTS as its Entertainer of the Year, and basketball star LeBron James was crowned Athlete of the Year.

Mr Feige told a Disney presentation for investors that Boseman's performance as the proud black leader of the fictional land of Wakanda was iconic, and that he would not be replaced.
Boseman died in August of colon cancer at age 43 after a four-year battle with the disease that he had kept private.
Mr Feige said the sequel would honour Boseman's legacy by continuing to "explore the world of Wakanda and all of the rich and varied characters."
He said the sequel was due to arrive in movie theatres in July 2022.
Black Panther executive producer Victoria Alonso last month denied speculation that the filmmakers planned to use a digital double for Boseman in the sequel.
Boseman's final film, drama Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, will be released by Netflix on December 18.
Disney also announced a heavy slate of new shows for its streaming services, including Marvel and Star Wars series on its Disney+ platform and the Kardashians for Hulu.
Boom
By the end of fiscal 2024, Disney expects to attract as many as 350 million global subscribers across all of its streaming services, easily more than double the 137 million it has today.
Armed with fresh content, Disney will also raise the price of Disney+ by €2 to €8.99.
The aggressive push comes as Disney taps into a home entertainment boom stoked by the global coronavirus pandemic, with more people staying indoors and seeking out new shows.
Disney said it plans to release 10 new TV series each in the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, including two spinoffs of The Mandalorian over the next few years.

The much-loved star, who suffered from dementia, died on Thursday evening.
She was best known for the Carry On films and for her role as Queen Vic landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders.
The soap said in a statement: "We are all deeply saddened that we've lost our Dame.
"From the moment Barbara stepped foot in Walford she created an icon in Peggy Mitchell, our formidable landlady, who the audience instantly fell in love with.
"But to all of us at EastEnders, she was our dearest friend who was truly loved and adored by everyone.
"Our thoughts go out to Scott and Barbara's family.
"Rest in peace Dame Barbara Windsor".
Steve McFadden, who plays Barbara's on-screen son Phil Mitchell, said: "I truly loved Barbara and, like everyone, I am going to miss her terribly.
"When anyone ever asked what she was like, I would always say she was everything you would hope she would be, and more," he said.
Letitia Dean, who stars as Sharon Mitchell, said the actress "will be missed beyond measure".
Incredible
"They broke the mould when they made Dame Barbara Windsor, there will never be another like that incredible woman, everyone who met her loved her and she will be deeply missed," she said.
Shane Richie, who played Alfie Moon in Walford, said: "I'm absolutely devastated as Barbara was a friend as well as my TV boss in the Queen Vic.
"We shared many a story in between filming - to amazement of situations (we found ourselves in) to laughter."
Adam Woodyatt, who plays Ian Beale, said: "I grew up watching 'Babs' in the Carry On films and for me to then work with her was a privilege and honour.
"I have so many happy memories and moments that I will always cherish, even when Peggy floored Ian with a punch.
"My thoughts are with her amazing husband Scott, her family and friends. Rest in peace Barbara."
Larry Lamb, who played Peggy's love interest Archie Mitchell, recalled the first time the pair met on the set of the BBC soap.
"She was larger than life. She was the head girl at EastEnders, she was the one everybody respected and she liked everything to run smoothly," he said.
"She was just an old-school actress.
"Barbara knew how to keep everybody together and make it a team, she was really special."

The deal was adopted on December 12, 2015 by 196 countries but, so far, global leaders have failed to deliver on its promises, she said in a video that urged her 10.5 million Instagram followers to "#FightFor1point5".
That was a reference to the ambition set out in the accord to hold the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
The video showed images of politicians and bureaucrats hugging and cheering when the Paris Agreement was signed.
Dystopian
Yet the five subsequent years have been the hottest ever recorded, Thunberg said in the video, which mixed her sober address with dystopian images of fire and flooding.
Pledges so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions put the world on track for a dire 3C or more of warming this century, with countries planning to produce double the amount of fossil fuels needed to hit the 1.5C target in the next decade alone, the United Nations and research groups said last week.
"Hypothetical targets are being set and big speeches are being given, yet when it comes to the immediate action we need, we are still in state of complete denial," Thunberg said.
"We are still speeding in the wrong direction."
Thunberg (17) rose to fame in 2018 when her school strike for climate change campaign became a viral sensation online, turning her lone protest into a global movement.
Since then she has become a thorn in the side of the world's political elite.
She ended the video on an optimistic note, saying the solution was in making people - rather than simply policymakers - aware of the extent of the climate crisis.
"Let's make this our main priority. Let's unite and spread awareness... We are the hope. We the people."

Over-70s living at home won't get jab until at least February

Dr Denis McCauley, GP spokesman for the Irish Medical Organisation, said it is likely GPs will not become involved until there is enough vaccine to offer to older groups in the community.
Most of the first consignment of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine is expected to be used immunising residents in long-term care and frontline healthcare workers.
The patients who will, in the initial stages, be offered the vaccine by their family doctor will generally be those who are also in line for the annual flu shot, he pointed out.
Around half of people given the Covid-19 jab will have a sore arm for a day or so.
GPs will have just five days to administer the vaccine to stop it getting too warm.
He was speaking as the high-level report of the task force established to draw up the plan for the roll-out of the vaccine was delivered to the Health Minister last night.
The Department of Health was unable to say yesterday how many will be eligible for the first vaccines in January.
An important element of the plan is expected to include a strong level of security following a warning by Interpol about theft of the vaccines by criminal gangs.
The need for people living in the community to wait for a number of months for the vaccine comes as three more Covid-related deaths were announced yesterday.
A further 313 new cases of the virus were diagnosed indicating the numbers are still stable for now with two weeks to Christmas. The numbers in hospital fell to 197 but there are still 35 seriously ill patients in intensive care.
Donegal, Kilkenny and Louth have the highest 14-day incidence while it is lowest in Leitrim, Kerry and Cork. The latest report on healthcare worker infections show 3,783 were diagnosed with the virus between August and the end of November. Of these, 88 were hospitalised and seven treated in intensive care.
Meanwhile, the HSE is extending the children's nasal spray flu vaccine to include teenagers ages 13 to 17.
It previously was only available to those aged from 2 to 12, but take up has been disappointing and the vaccines will be out of date in January.
Protect
There are no cases of flu recorded here yet this winter.
Dr Chantal Migone, specialist in public health medicine, said that so far nearly 200,000 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years have received the nasal flu vaccine through GP practices and pharmacies across the country.
"The first batches of nasal flu vaccine are due to expire in the middle of January so it's important for parents to come forward to get their children vaccinated now, to protect them against flu. Children are more likely than adults to get severe complications of flu.
"Over the last 10 years in Ireland 4,750 children needed to be admitted to hospital because of complications of flu, 183 of these then had to go to intensive care and, sadly, 41 children died.
"Children with chronic health conditions are most at risk of the serious complications of flu."
Meanwhile, a leading psychiatrist has said one in five people has "significantly increased psychological distress" which is likely attributable to anxiety about Covid-19 and the effects of restrictions
Dr Brendan Kelly of Trinity College Dublin said up to 86pc of healthcare workers globally reported feeling stressed and in Ireland up to 40pc of the radiographers surveyed showed signs of burnout - 30pc considered changing jobs or retiring, he wrote in the Irish Medical Journal.
Psychological distress among healthcare workers was found to be approximately double that of the general ­population.

Shot in the bark - Taoiseach reunites pup and owner

Pup Tipper had vanished from the Carrigaline, Co Cork, home of Michele Geary last weekend.
The desperate owner had gone looking for her pet and had posted appeals for information on his whereabouts on social media.
However, there was no sign.
Incredibly, Tipper was found after he stole the show at a Cork press conference where Mr Martin was opening a new affordable housing estate in Carrigaline.
The friendly pup ignored all social distancing guidelines as he happily sought an ear-scratching from assembled politicians, journalists, photographers and even gardaí at Mr Martin's press conference.
Bemused
Tipper even made the RTÉ and Virgin Media news bulletins as he wandered happily after the Taoiseach around the new estate.
Showing media training worthy of a professional, Tipper kept returning to the cameras.
Photographer Daragh MacSweeney of Provision captured a remarkable image of Tipper staring directly into the camera lens - while the Taoiseach looks on apparently bemused.
Eagle-eyed locals realised he was Michele's lost pup.
Michele said she was relieved to have been reunited with her pet.
"Thank you to everyone," she posted on the Carrigdhoun Facebook page.

The pop superstar surprised fans on Thursday by announcing Evermore, a follow-up to chart-topping Folklore, which arrived without warning in July.
Swift, who will celebrate her 31st birthday tomorrow, described Evermore, her ninth studio album, as a "sister record" to its predecessor.
Connected
It contains 15 tracks, while there will be an additional two bonus songs on the deluxe version.
Shortly after it was released yesterday, Swift said: "I have no idea what will come next.
"I have no idea about a lot of things these days and so I've clung to the one thing that keeps me connected to you all.
"That thing always has and always will be music."
Swift created Folklore during the first lockdown and when announcing Evermore said, "to put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing songs".
She has again worked with Aaron Dessner of rock band The National and singer-songwriter Jack Antonoff.
Swift shared the music video for the song Willow, featuring the singer exploring a pastoral scene.
Folklore was the first album of 2020 to sell a million copies.

Today, primary and post primary classrooms across Ireland will pause to air a video of collective thanks to all school community members from political, media, and sports personalities as part of national "Go raibh maith agaibh" (#GRMA) day.
Students at Scoil Chroí Íosa, Newcastle Road, Galway city, spent the week painting, writing poems and planning random acts of kindness.
Aditi Anil, sixth class, found lockdown boring but since being back at school, she feels "really happy" she can see her teachers and friends face-to-face.
"I am grateful that our teachers are risking their health to teach us and be with us every day," says Aditi.
Principal Colin Barry said his main focus when reopening was to ensure the well-being of the children.
"We are all trying really hard, and the students have all been brilliant. It is great to see them coming in smiling every morning.
Focus
"You can sort out the building and have masks and sanitiser, but the collective effort from all the staff and the parents to keep the kids safe is what really works."
President Higgins paid tribute to teachers, principals, special needs assistants, administrators, and classroom assistants.
"The virus threw into sharp focus the vital role that schools play in the lives of our children and how integral they are to the healthy functioning of our young people in society," he said.

Drunken soldier bit garda's hand in 'horrific' episode

Michael Neary (24) assaulted the officer when he was arrested on a Dublin street in what a court heard was a "horrific" incident.
He had been having problems with alcohol, but his supports were no longer in place during lockdown and he drank "far too much" on the night.
Judge Ann Ryan adjourned the case for a medical report on the accused, saying his behaviour was "off the wall" .
Neary, of Lorcan Avenue, Santry, pleaded guilty to assault; threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour; public intoxication; garda obstruction and violent behaviour in a garda station.
Dublin District Court heard gardaí were called to Shantalla Road, Santry, last April 17 and met the accused, who seemed highly agitated and paranoid.
Sprayed
He had his father's car keys, refused to give them back and, when gardaí tried to retrieve them, the accused tried to escape, running into the path of oncoming traffic.
He was pepper sprayed, but it had no effect on him, and he was arrested and taken to Ballymun garda station, where he kicked out and had to be restrained.
He bit a garda on the left hand, drawing blood.
Neary had dealt with his alcohol difficulty, but in lockdown his support structures were no longer around him, his solicitor Tracy Horan said.
He went to a friend's house, drank far too much and, on the way home, he himself rang gardaí.
"Things got out of control", and when one of the officers applied pressure to his back, Neary "panicked", Ms Horan said.
Neary had an impeccable record in the Defence Forces and had represented Ireland internationally in martial arts.
What happened on the night was a "one off," a slip due to a combination of a back injury and lockdown.

TradFest 2021 has been reimagined and will now run from the end of this month until next summer, kicking off with an RTÉ show, Ireland In Music, on December 29.
From January 27, five nights of streamed concerts will take place from Dublin Castle featuring musicians like Mundy, Eleanor McEvoy and Dónal Lunny.
However, organisers are hoping to stage the first indoor 'Covid-safe concerts' as early as April in venues including St Patrick's Cathedral.
It is believed this can be achieved by bringing in air-filtration systems made by Irish company Novaerus.
Using plasma technology, the company says its bespoke units will kill and deactivate not only the Covid-19 virus, but all airborne viruses.
Fifty concerts have been planned for 50 audience members and running over five days across some iconic Dublin venues, provided Ireland is at Level 2 restrictions.
Safest
Martin Harte, TradFest CEO, said the new units will provide decontaminated air so they will have "the safest spaces for audiences".
He said these systems have been approved by Professor Jack Lambert, a consultant in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital.
"We realise it's not going to be in the same mass numbers as it once was. It will probably be summer of 2021 when we start to deliver safe sessions back in the pubs in Temple Bar with quality artists. You're looking at about six months' time," he said.
Some 'Safe Summer Sessions' are also planned as part of TradFest, with venues in Dublin's Cultural Quarter hoping to lay on live music again.
Launched yesterday by Arts Minister Catherine Martin, she said she would do her "level best" to ensure there will be live music next year.
"This year has been way too silent," she said. "I'm determined live music will come back; it's my goal to make sure we get to hear live music and musicians earn a living again."
Ms Martin is a former secondary school teacher of music and English.

Irish Rail sorry after man allegedly exposed himself on train

Limerick podcaster Sophie La Touche criticised Irish Rail after she reported the incident to a staff member on the train.
She was travelling on the 12.50pm from Limerick to Heuston last Thursday when a man sitting in the aisle across from her began talking to her.
"I was uncomfortable. Then I put my hood up and I put my earphones in."
He then moved to allegedly expose himself.
"He had the buttons of his jeans open and he was touching himself across the way from me," said Ms La Touche.
The man then allegedly followed her to another carriage, but after she began speaking to another woman passenger, he returned to the carriage Ms La Touche had left.
She spoke to an Irish Rail employee on the train.
"He said: 'The one thing that I could suggest is when we get to Heuston, I can get the guards there and you can make a statement.'"
Irish Rail said the train host offered to involve the gardaí but Ms La Touche did not want to at the time.
It said the man was "observed and kept in a separate carriage from the customer for the remainder of the journey".
This is "in line" with Irish Rail training, it stated.
Ms La Touche said she was left "shocked" at encountering the man at station gates later that day at Heuston station.
She said the man was "just let go" and it wasn't until she voiced her concerns with station staff he was held back so she could get the Luas.
Irish Rail said the train host had contacted Heuston prior to arrival, that the station manager and security personnel met the train, and an offer of garda assistance was  made and declined by Ms La Touche.
But when she eventually left the station, Ms La Touche said the man was allowed to leave too - and was right beside her when she left.
Irish Rail admitted the man went to the front of the station and a staff member "intervened to involve security again when he was seen approaching the Luas".
A garda investigation had begun and no arrests have yet been made.
Irish Rail said it is "extremely sorry" Ms La Touche experienced "such a distressing incident on board".

Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan also confirmed he will not be visiting any restaurants this Christmas for personal reasons, although he accepted other people may need to do so to meet up with friends.
Professor Philip Nolan, who is tracking the virus, said: "Now is the time to make decisions about what interactions are necessary and pose the lowest risk to you, your family and friends over Christmas.
"Please be mindful that this remains a very dangerous virus, especially for vulnerable and older persons.
"We have the know-how and the determination to keep suppressing this disease, to protect our family and friends over Christmas."
He was speaking as another 310 people were diagnosed with the virus, indicating the country has reached a stable point. But the objective is to keep it at that level.
The number of patients in hospital are declining slowly, with 202 recorded yesterday, including 36 in intensive care, where there is no sign of any fall yet.
Infection
The R number is at 0.9-1, which means each positive person passes it on to one other .
Prof Nolan warned the number of deaths each day are still too high. The level of infection in the over 85s is also falling but it remains excessive and there is no evidence the virus is less lethal. He said the risk of dying with the virus increases with age.
However, people in the 40-59 age bracket have a one in 1,000 risk of dying from Covid-19 - which is low but not "negligible". It rises to one in 20 for people aged 70 to 80 and one in six for the over 85s.
He said it emphasises the need for caution with intergenerational mixing over Christmas.
Dr Holohan said that today marks "14 days to Christmas Day. To ensure the safest possible interaction with your family over Christmas, consider restricting your movements now.
"Risk-assess the environments you plan to be in over the next two weeks; are they compliant with public health measures?
"Can you keep a two-metre distance? Are people wearing face coverings? Now is the time to make decisions about what interactions are necessary and pose the lowest risk to you, your family and friends over Christmas."

Priest recovers after suffering pepper-spray attack

Police in Rome are investigating the assault on Fr John Coughlan, a native of Riverstown parish, Co Sligo, in the Diocese of Elphin.
Fr Coughlan disturbed the men at the seminary, and was pepper sprayed by one of the intruders as they made their escape from the building.
"The three men were wearing masks and baseball caps. They were making their way up the main stairwell when Fr Coughlan became aware of their presence and challenged them verbally from the foot of the stairs," said a spokesman for the Irish seminary.
"They then turned to come back down and, as the first man passed by, he used pepper spray on Fr Coughlan's face in order to disable him."
The intruders then continued to make their escape from the building and out of the college's grounds.
Local police were alerted, and paramedics gave Fr Coughlan a medical check.
The incident occurred on November 30 and Fr Coughlan has since recovered.
He has suffered no lasting effects, the spokesman said.
Damage
While nothing was stolen, the entrance gate of the college received minor damage.
Founded in 1628, the Irish College is located in Via dei Santi Quattro in the heart of Rome, near the Baptistery of St John Lateran.
It is well known by many Irish couples who have opted to marry in its chapel.
In recent years, the seminary has been home to three communities: Irish seminarians, American seminarians and clerics undertaking international postgraduate studies.
In 2019, the college catered for 33 resident seminarians and 16 non-resident seminarians in formation as well as four Irish priests on the staff.
However, in June, the college's trustees, Archbishops Eamon Martin, Diarmuid Martin, Michael Neary and Kieran O'Reilly, announced that they would not be sending any Irish seminarians to the college for the academic year 2020-2021.
The number of Irish seminarians studying in Rome has sharply declined over the past decade.
In 2016, the college opened its doors to American seminarians, enabling them to undertake a semester abroad at the college - 16 non-Irish seminarians studied there last year.
Despite the assault on Fr Coughlan, the Irish College has announced that its annual advent service will take place online via YouTube today.

Mr Browne said the posts from 2014, 2015 and 2017, when he was a Sinn Féin councillor in Tipperary, "do not reflect my views".
"I apologise for these posts and I should not have posted them," he said in a statement.
Among the examples was one from 2015, when Mr Browne shared a post that suggested a hologram of a plane was used to fake the Twin Towers attacks on September 11, 2001.
"It would make you wonder," he wrote.
In another post, from 2014, he shared a link to a Russia Today story in which the late Cuban president Fidel Castro was quoted comparing Nato to the Nazi SS and criticising the US and Israel for creating Islamic State.
"He may not be wrong," Mr Browne wrote.
Earlier, he was accused of trying to censor an Oireach- tas committee after a failed bid to move its meeting into a private session to dis- cuss controversial remarks he had made on local radio.
The chair of the Oireachtas Petitions Committee was confronted by Fine Gael TDs over comments he made on Tipp FM on Wednesday, when he admitted calling to party members' homes when he had disagreed with their social media posts.
In the same interview, Mr Browne said Sinn Féin needs to stop apologising for its "core belief" that Provisional IRA attacks were a continuation of the War of Independence.
Speaking on Tipp Today in relation to the Brian Stanley tweet row, he said: "Apologies, in my own personal view, they should stop."
The remarks drew criticism from Fine Gael committee members.
Concerned
The meeting was forced to adjourn after calls from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for Mr Browne to make a Dáil statement on his comments.
Deputy government whip Brendan Griffin said he was "very concerned" by the comments and asked Mr Browne to commit to making a statement in the Dáil on the matter.
Mr Browne insisted the issue was not on the agenda and urged members to listen to the full radio interview.

SpaceX rocket explodes during attempted landing

The Starship rocket destroyed in the accident at the company's rocket launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, was a 16-storey-tall prototype for the heavy-lift launch vehicle being developed by the billionaire entrepreneur's private space company to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars.
Pressure
The self-guided rocket blew up on Wednesday as it touched down on a landing pad following a controlled descent.
The test flight had been intended to reach an altitude of 12,500 metres, propelled by three of SpaceX's newly developed Raptor engines for the first time.
Mr Musk tweeted immediately after the explosion that the rocket's "fuel header tank pressure was low" during descent, "causing touchdown velocity to be high".
He added SpaceX had obtained "all the data we needed" from the test and hailed the ascent a success.
SpaceX made its first attempt to launch Starship on Tuesday, but a problem with its Raptor engines forced an automatic abort just before liftoff.
The complete Starship rocket, which will stand 120 metres tall, is the company's next-generation fully reusable launch vehicle and the centre of Mr Musk's ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine.

You can't say it's a false position for United to be in, two points off the top, as the league table doesn't lie and they have produced some results.
But I look at other teams and you know what you'll get: Tottenham will be defensive and hit you on the break, Chelsea are passing it forward and using their wide players, Liverpool play their way as do Manchester City... but I never know what United are doing.
They do get wins but you can get lucky, win games because you have some good quality players. But you can't see them making a sustained title challenge, as they don't have an identity for how they play. And while United have been able to stay in the top six in the Premier League, they have now been exposed in Europe, out of the Champions League already.
What we saw this week in Europe was just typical of this United side, and I don't see how they can change it. They were in a tough group in the Champions League but still had a good start, and yet threw it away with that result in Turkey. PSG and Leipzig were tough teams but when it came down to it, they just weren't good enough.
They seem to me like a team who turn it on when they are 2-0 down as there is no stress. They feel the pressure is off so they play without fear, because the game is more or less lost already.
The great Manchester United teams, the United sides that won trophies, they walked out and played with the freedom and confidence that said they were the best team in the country and they feared no one, they never seemed to worry.
When I look at United now I see a side who are afraid of losing a game before it's started. They have that fear but somehow they start to play a bit when they are a goal down. I don't know how you change that culture. The players need to do their jobs on the pitch but it has to be instilled in them in the dressing room before the game starts that they should have no fear.
I don't see progress made in the two years that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been there, and if you gave him another two years, I don't envisage a change. No one seems to know what United's ambition is as a club anymore, and it's not a side that's going in the right direction.
That said, it's strange that they are high up in the Premier League table - they could end up just two points off the top of the table this weekend.
They don't look like a side who could mount a title challenge and yet they are in a good position, more or less in spite of how they are playing, because they so rarely play well for 90 minutes. They can have a good spell, a decent half, but they never start a game well and yet they've got some good results.
When I point out that United are inconsistent, people say back to me that they are a consistent side because of where they are in the table. But they never give me the belief that they will win games.
Paul Pogba is one of their marquee signings and also their biggest problem. He has to leave, it's time for him to go.
We saw this week how comments from Pogba's agent caused problems but we have seen this so often with that agent. It wasn't Pogba who spoke, it was the agent, but the agent was speaking on his behalf, and if that's how Pogba feels, he has to be sold on.
For all the good that he has in his game, how well he plays when he's on form, he's not producing it for United. I can't see a scenario where it turns around and he becomes the best player in that United side. He will play well now and again but they have not got the best out of him and he's not getting the best out of himself.
If I was in that dressing room, I'd have a problem with what the agent says. When a player comes out and says he doesn't want to be there anymore, the rest of the squad tend to react by thinking, 'f*** you, we do want to be here, we are fighting for this team, this club, you don't want to be here because you don't think I'm good enough to share a dressing room with you'.
If it was Harry Kane, who is doing all he can for his club, who said that, or his agent who made those remarks, you'd think, 'fair enough'. Kane would be speaking from a position of strength. He's a player who has done his best, has done all that's been asked of him, has tried for his club and his teammates but has not had success. If he wants better for himself, then you can talk about it.
But Pogba's not coming from a position of strength, he's not done well for United. It doesn't matter that he's a World Cup winner, maybe the Premier League is just too difficult for him.
He won that World Cup with great players around him, he didn't win it on his own.
He is a good player but he's never been someone who grabs a game by the horns and steers his team the right way.
And I can't see there being a huge clamour from other clubs for Paul Pogba, the footballer. Someone will sign him because of the commercial value he adds but not what he does on the pitch.
United don't start games well and while it's not all down to Pogba, to me he goes out in every game expecting to be amazing, instead of going out there determined to be the best player on the park and delivering for his team, doing the hard work. Instead, the game falls away from United and that is so frustrating for their players and supporters.
Even though Solskaer has a good record in derby games, tomorrow's game is when it could turn back in City's favour.
City, gradually, have been getting things back together, they have been scoring goals and they've had a lot of clean sheets lately.
Sergio Aguero coming back in, and scoring, in that midweek game in the Champions League will add to what they already have.

US regulators launch bid to split Facebook over 'monopoly plot'

Twin lawsuits filed in the federal district court allege Facebook under its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg behaved for years as an unlawful monopoly.
It was claimed it had repeatedly "weaponised" its vast stores of data, seemingly limitless wealth and savvy corporate muscle to fend off threats and maintain its stature as one of the most widely-used social networking services in the world.
Enrich
The state and federal complaints chiefly challenge Face- book's acquisition of two companies - Instagram, the photo-sharing tool, and messaging service WhatsApp.
Investigators said the purchases ultimately helped Facebook remove potentially potent rivals from the digital marketplace, allowing the tech giant to enrich itself on advertising dollars at the cost of users, who as a result have fewer social networking options at their disposal.
The lawsuits together represent the most significant political and legal threats to the company in its 16-year history, setting up a high-profile clash between US regulators and one of Silicon Valley's most profitable firms, which could take years to resolve.
Anti-trust regulators explicitly asked a court to consider forcing Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp to remedy their competition concerns.
Such a punishment would unwind Zuckerberg's digital empire and severely constrain Facebook's ambitions.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), led by Republican chairman Joe Simons, brought its lawsuit in a District of Columbia district court.
Letitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, led her Democratic and Republican counterparts from dozens of states and territories in filing their complaint in the same venue.
The lawsuits drew a swift response from Facebook, which pledged to "vigorously defend" its business practices.
"People and small businesses don't choose to use Facebook's free services and advertising because they have to, they use them because our apps and services deliver the most value," said Jennifer Newstead, the company's vice-president and general counsel.

Toby Walker (22) was spared a conviction for a weapons charge after Blanchardstown District Court heard he had not intended to intimidate his partner's son.
Judge David McHugh applied the Probation Act.
Walker, of Cannon Brook Park, Lucan, admitted producing a weapon in the course of a dispute.
Sergeant Walter Sweeney said there was a domestic incident between Walker and his then-partner at Cannon Brook Park last May 3.
Convictions
The woman's adult son got involved and told Walker to leave his mother alone, Sgt Sweeney said.
The accused had a screwdriver in his hand and "leaned forward" with it, but there was no contact with anyone and no further action after that.
Walker had no previous convictions.
The accused had the screwdriver in his hand for an "unrelated domestic chore", his solicitor Matthew Kenny told the court.
It was not taken out to intimidate the victim, but he had it in his hand when he lost his temper.
Walker had had a "long and meaningful relationship" with the victim's mother and re- gretted his behaviour on the day.
The relationship was now at an end and the family had "made their peace", the court heard.

The rolling message on the screen highlighted what's going to be the big public debate of 2021 - ending Covid-19 with the roll-out of approved vaccines.
After displaying outrageous and misleading nonsense about face masks, urging people to take them off because they "spread disease" and "cause long-term damage to the lungs", the screen then displayed the most ridiculous message of all: "No forced vaccines."
It's on that ridiculous statement that I want to focus.
At no point in any country in the world has there been any suggestion that the population will be forced to take a Covid-19 vaccine.
Indeed, the World Health Organisation has said persuasion would be far preferable to forcing people to take vaccines.
To be honest, I'm beginning to despair of the amount of fake news rubbish that's circulating online.
For example, I saw a video yesterday from a young mother (who was involved in a protest outside Senator Malcolm Byrne's Gorey office this week) in which she claimed the vaccine contains human babies and that nobody will take away parents' choice to vaccinate their kids.
Well, to this woman and many like her who clearly spend far too much time seeking out fake news, please check all your information before you have any more sleepless nights and spread further unnecessary fear.
First, there's no tissue from an aborted human foetus in the Covid-19 vaccine, despite a Facebook video posted last month claiming there is.
Second, no child will be immunised against Covid yet because trials on young people have not been extensive enough for approval to be given.
That mother needn't worry. Nobody will be forced to take any vaccine.
When I go on holiday and board a large aircraft carrying hundreds of people, flying 10km high, I know I'm taking a risk.
The engines could fail, it could be hijacked or the pilot could be suicidal, but that's a risk most of us are willing to take.
Similarly with the vaccines coming our way, there may be some small risks.
However, I trust our medical experts and the scientific community behind the vaccines and believe them when they say they're safe.
Everything in life is a risk, but injecting a vaccine into my arm is one I'm more than happy to take to get my life (and this country) back on track.
It wouldn't bother me if in future we needed to carry a vaccination passport to travel or enter crowded spaces.
That's not forced vaccination, but it might just help persuade more people to get the jab and help Ireland achieve herd immunity against this scourge.

Chief medic fears a new year rise in ICU patients and deaths

The news comes amid another warning about a potential Christmas and New Year surge in infections, leaving more people facing life-threatening complications and the risk of death.
Eight more people were admitted to intensive care yesterday, bringing the number in need of the highest level of treatment to 38.
A further 224 patients are in hospital, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said.
Five more deaths were reported, and the daily number of new cases continued to cause concern, with 227 people diagnosed with the virus yesterday.
However, despite fears about the spread of the virus, the Department of Health and the HSE were unable to say how many over-65s in long-term care in public facilities - including nursing homes - will be offered the Covid-19 vaccine if it is approved later this month.
This is despite this high-risk group being prioritised for vaccination.
The task force report on the proposed rollout of the vaccine is due to be presented to Taoiseach Micheál Martin yesterday.
It raises new concerns about the ability of the HSE to properly handle the complexities of the delivery and administration of the vaccine.
There are also no figures on the number of frontline healthcare workers who will be offered the vaccine.
A spokesman for Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents private nursing homes, said it is planning for 28,000 over-65s and 32,000 staff to be offered the jab.
Outbreaks
The vaccine would be key to protecting these older people in congregated settings from contracting the virus, developing serious illness and ending up in intensive care.
It comes as the number of Covid-19 outbreaks in private homes rose last week after the lifting of lockdown - up to 288 compared with 262 the previous week.
School outbreaks also in- creased, to 14 from 12, but they fell in hospitals from 10 to seven.
In meat, fish and poultry plants, where there is serial testing, 36 staff were diagnosed with the virus last week, while 19 employees in other workplaces were also diagnosed.
"Covid-19 is still an extremely infectious disease that has the potential to lead to hospitalisation and even intensive care admissions," Dr Holohan said in regard to a potential January surge.
"Ireland has managed to suppress Covid-19 to the lowest incidence levels in the EU in recent weeks.
"We have managed to keep up our safe behaviours and worked to protect each other throughout the pandemic.
"If we do not continue to suppress the disease, we will very quickly see a surge in infections leading to an increase in hospitalisations, intensive care admissions and, tragically, deaths.
"We are actively planning to begin vaccinating people in early 2021.
"We cannot afford to drop our guard now."
Yesterday's cases included 70 in Dublin, 26 in Donegal, 19 in Limerick, 14 in Louth and 14 in Kilkenny.

Irish firm used UK PR company to lobby MPs over Grenfell fire role

Cavan-based Kingspan used UK PR firm Portland in summer 2017 to try to convince "key decision makers" that combustible materials were safe if properly installed.
The firm, which manufactured the flammable Kooltherm K15 used on the refurbished tower block, listed ideal political lobby targets on internal documents including then-home secretary Amber Rudd, and then-housing secretary Sajid Javid, who went on to be chancellor.
Michael Gove, who still serves in the Cabinet, was also noted as a "key decision maker" as the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs at the time.
Punchy
Other MPs from across the House of Commons were also mentioned in the Kingspan Political Engagement Plan as people with whom the business wanted to get in touch.
The overview of the document said: "Some people will not want to meet you and they will not want to be lobbied. But there is still immeasurable value in getting Kingspan's manifesto in front of these decision makers."
It said messages from the firm needed to be "punchy, memorable and easy to understand".
The document was shown as Kingspan's head of technical and marketing, Adrian Pargeter, gave his third day of evidence to the inquiry.
It continued: "There is still a lot of discussion to be had about approaching the public inquiry. We don't know the inquiry's terms of reference and we don't know if Kingspan will be asked to give evidence."
The terms of reference were laid out in August 2017, around six weeks after the fire, suggesting that the Portland document was published at some point between mid-June 2017 and the end of the summer.
Closing his evidence yesterday afternoon, Mr Pargeter said he "never thought a fire like (Grenfell) could happen in the UK".
He also claimed Kingspan had "learnt some lessons" and was "trying to make improvements" following the blaze.
Kooltherm K15 was the minority material used on the refurbished Grenfell Tower. Most of the insulation came from another firm, Celotex.
There will not be any more evidence heard until at least January 11.

Kelly distracted by match in Luas mask gaffe

The Herald obtained a picture of the Tipperary TD travelling on the Green Line on Tuesday night.
In it, Mr Kelly can be seen without a face mask or other covering.
He apologised yesterday, saying he was distracted while watching Manchester United's Champions League defeat to RB Leipzig.
"I am a strong supporter of all the public health guidelines and rules and always endeavour to wear my mask where required," Mr Kelly said in a statement.
"My track record on calling for clear guidelines around mask wearing speaks for itself.
"While getting the Luas home last night, I obviously inadvertently didn't have my mask on for a period and I want to apologise for this mistake.
"I was distracted while watching the Man United match on my phone and adjusting my headphones at the same time.
"We all make mistakes. Sorry."
The picture emerged the day after Mr Kelly called on all TDs and senators to sign a Labour pledge to support the rollout of the Covid vaccine and the public awareness campaign and to take the vaccine themselves.
Advocate
He has been at the forefront of Covid-19 campaigning, and in recent weeks has been challenging the Government on its plans to roll out a vaccine, including calling for a dedicated vaccine minister.
He has been a strong advocate for face masks, heavily criticising the last government for the "chronic disaster" in its communications around wearing them.
"Nobody should get on public transport without a mask, full stop. People should wear masks in retail outlets to protect workers," Mr Kelly told the Dáil in June.
In October, he said the Government needed to be clearer in calling on the public to wear masks instead of visors.
"We have to communicate the difference between visors and proper masks," he said.
"There is a huge difference. I have stressed it for a week to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health," he said.

Loughlin, best-known for playing Aunt Becky in sitcom Full House, admitted paying $500,000 (€414,000) to get Olivia Jade and her 22-year-old sister, Isabella, into university.
She and her husband Mossimo Giannulli are behind bars for their part in the scandal that shocked the US last year.
Giannulli, a 21-year-old social media influencer, appeared on Facebook Watch show Red Table Talk with host Jada Pinkett Smith, the host's mother Adrienne Banfield-Jones and daughter  Willow Smith.
Pinkett Smith, the wife of Hollywood star Will Smith, admitted her mother objected to Giannulli appearing on the show because of her privileged position as the daughter of celebrities.
"I'm not trying to victimise myself. I don't want pity. I don't deserve pity," Giannulli said, apologising for her family's part in the scandal.
"We messed up. I just want a second chance to be like, 'I recognise I messed up'.
"For so long I wasn't able to talk about this because of the legalities behind it."
Giannulli, who lost brand deals and left the University of Southern California following the controversy, said she did not realise her parents were breaking the law.
"What's so important to me is to learn from the mistake, not to be shamed and punished and never given a second chance," she said.
Loughlin (56) started a two-month sentence at a California prison in October and is due for release within weeks.
Mossimo (57) began his five-month sentence last month.
Dozens of prominent people, including actress Felicity Huffman, were prosecuted for their roles in the scandal, which was dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.
Well-off parents were found to be paying hefty bribes to get their children into elite universities.

The former Baywatch star said coursing, which involves hares being chased by greyhounds, was "cruel and reckless" and at odds with the "warmth and goodwill" that Ireland is known for.
Hare coursing is already banned in the UK.
Coursing events were recently suspended in Ire- land due to Covid restric- tions.
Anderson has written to Mr Martin in her role with animal rights organisation Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals).
Circuses
It is not the first time that the Canadian-born actress has reached out to a Taoi- seach.
She urged Enda Kenny to ban wild animal circuses and called on Leo Varadkar to prohibit fur farming.
The Government has since banned wild animal circuses and has committed to phasing out fur farming.
"Will you please be the Taoiseach who finally lays cruel hare coursing to rest?" she wrote in her latest letter.
"The novel coronavirus has taught us the devastating consequences of messing with wildlife.
"Your government can heed that lesson by banning this so-called 'sport', in which gentle, sensitive hares are torn from their homes so that they can be chased by hounds for someone's twisted idea of amusement.
"Hare coursing is reckless - and it's cruel. Many hares die when they are captured, transported and held captive before meets.
"Some endure stress-induced heart attacks or other organ damage.
"This blood sport is at odds with the warmth and goodwill that people around the world know and love Ireland for."

WB Yeats letters reveal the iconic poet was tormented by self-doubt

The seven letters include six addressed to Ethel Veasey and one to her brother, Harley Cyril Veasey, and were sent between 1883 and 1885.
Yeats met Cyril when they were both students at the Godolphin School in Hammersmith in England.
The letters, which were sold for more than £47,000 (€53,000) at an auction in London on Tuesday, give a glimpse into the early stages of his career.
The first letters show his ambitions and doubts as he responds to a question from Ethel about his writing, admitting that he is writing poems but "none that I am at all satisfied with".
One letter focuses on his thoughts about landscape and how he longs for "once acre of green wood willed with the hum of insects".
This was written three years before his famous poem about nature's beauty, The Lake Isle of Innisfree.
In April 1884, Yeats wrote about one of his earliest verse dramas Time and the Witch Vivien, disclosing it originated at a Christmas fancy dress ball.
On July 18, 1884, he gives a vivid account of the family's move to 10 Ashfield Terrace. "Our new house is better than our old one but dull, from my Howth window I had a view of a wide sea and much heather and at times could say 'there goes a grey gull - let verse be as spontaneous as the flight of a grey full over the bay'."
He goes on, "But here from my window I see a straight wall and by much stretching round the corner, the glimpse of a bush very dim and dusty - a lamentable view for a maker of verses."
He also wrote about some of his friends.
Nihilists
He mentioned CH Oldham, editor of the Dublin Literary Review, who was described by some to be a political radical: "Up to the lips in plots and away in his house on the slopes of the mountains he entertains nihilists and other strange people."
The letters, which sold at a Sotheby's auction in London, had a pre-sale estimate of £12,000 to £18,000 (€13,000-€20,000), but sold for £47,880 (€53,076) to an anonymous buyer.

Beatrice Hurley (69) and her husband Michael (70) died on Saturday night when their home in Beach Park, Portmarnock, caught fire.
Their funeral mass will be at 10am at St Anne's Church in Portmarnock village.
Covid-19 guidelines mean it can be attended only by immediate family members.
The service will be streamed live online.
Neighbours who saw the blaze said the house "went up like a box of matches", while another described it as "like a tinderbox".
Mr Hurley had worked at Dublin Airport before his retirement, but he remained active in the community, teaching junior players of the Portmarnock Squash Club.
Gentleman
"A proper Cork gentleman, Mick loved his pints and he loved his squash," the club said in a tribute.
A neighbour said: "They were a lovely couple. It's so sad. We're all really upset.

An online buyer won the bidding war for the lamps at the Niall Mullen Signature Auction in Kells, Co Meath.
Predicted to fetch €800 to €1,200, the lamps were snapped up for nearly three times the higher guide price.
Outbid
"They're from the most important theatre in Dublin and that is what made them sought- after," said Niall Mullen, who coordinated the sale with Victor Mee Auctions.
"They are pieces of Dublin history. Hopefully, they will be staying in the country."
The buyer outbid a group led by the owner of the Dublin-based Stage Lighting Centre and theatre enthusiast Tomas Fitzgerald.
"Congratulations to who- ever has them," Mr Fitzgerald said.
"We hope they do the lamps proud.
"One of our plans was to see if the Gaiety would take one of them back, restore it and display it in the lobby."
The part-brass Edwardian lamps were discovered stored away in a corner of the theatre's rafters.
They were first bought for around £130 each in the early 1900s and were later replaced and kept in storage at the 149-year-old venue.
The two-day auction, which included the facade of Dublin's Berkeley Court Hotel, was Ireland's biggest interiors sale of the year.

Tony Levins (50) was bound to a peace bond for one year and was also ordered to have no contact whatsoever with his victim John Foley and his family.
He sent anonymous and threatening typed letters and text messages to Mr Foley in what a judge called a "very serious and shocking case" and "bizarre behaviour".
Levins threatened to batter him into a coma, and threatened to "get him when he least expects it", with a "knife or infected needle".
He also sent anonymous letters to Mr Foley's partner and his employer in an attempt to tarnish his character and work performance.
He also paid visits to Mr Foley's workplace, Drogheda District Court heard.
He was caught because his DNA was found on the envelopes of the letters.
Levins had known Mr Foley for years, and in one of the letters told him: "You are lucky I didn't connect a hurley to your head. I would have battered you in a coma."
A second letter sent by Levins stated: "We will get you when you are least expecting it. Who's gonna notice a knife or an infected needle stabbing you in a packed pub or a busy street?"
Levins, of Ashfield Grove, North Road, Drogheda, Co Louth, pleaded guilty to harassing Mr Foley at various locations between March 1, 2018, and February 1, 2019.
He also pleaded guilty to threatening to kill him. He has no previous convictions.
Mr Foley told the court he had "suffered death threats hanging over me".
"I suffered. I could have lost my job because of the letters written about me. His apology letter does not show remorse.
"He is saying that he is not a dangerous or violent person yet one of his letters said 'you are lucky I didn't connect a hurley to your head. I would have battered you into a coma'," said Mr Foley.
A probation report said Levins has "demonstrated remorse and shame and recognises the damage he caused", and that he has sought treatment for his mental health.
The court heard Levins' underlying mental health issue was sparked following the sudden death of his brother in 2018.
Defence solicitor Patrick Goodwin said Levins "offered Mr Foley €2,000 but this wasn't accepted", adding the defendant has been "offered a work position".
Sanction
"If he gets a conviction he is concerned that job opportunity will go," said Mr Goodwin, asking the judge not to impose a prison sentence.
Addressing the court, Mr Foley said: "What I want is maximum protection for myself and family. If he gets away too lightly he could do this to someone else.
"He is not the victim here today," Mr Foley said, when Judge Eirinn McKiernan was considering the sanction for Levins.
"I am not diminishing in any way the gravity of what he did and Mr Foley has suffered terribly," the judge said.
"In normal circumstances it would involve custody without hesitation but he has an underlying mental health issue."
She then bound Levins to the peace for 12 months and ordered him not to have any contact with Mr Foley and his family.

14 murders prevented and €20m drugs seized as 340 gardai back on front line

The 2019 report was published yesterday and showed a new operating model that Commissioner Drew Harris said gives more resources to growing garda divisions and increased garda visibility in communities.
More than 340 gardaí were reassigned to frontline duties, and the report says there are now more personnel than at any time in the force's history, with 14,307 members.
A regular public attitudes survey showed that, in the third quarter of last year, there was 92pc public trust in An Garda Síochána, the highest level in the past five years.
Armed
Under the heading of National Security & Intelligence, the report says the Armed Support Unit (ASU) responded to 4,390 "higher-risk spontaneous incidents".
Ninety-eight hostage/barricade/suicide incidents were dealt with and 11 people were convicted before the Special Criminal court and higher courts.
More than 300 refugees were security-screened by Special Detective Unit (SDU) personnel under the Government's Irish Refugee Resettlement Programme.
The report says there were 4,113 scene of crime case files and 923 crime scene identifications made.
The Garda Information Services Centre (GISC) received 763,000 calls and created 877,000 incidents on the Pulse system.
Cannabis herb made up the majority of the drug seizures in money terms with a value of more than €9m, followed by cocaine at €7.3m and cannabis plants at €6.8m.
While the assessment of the Policing Plan shows much has been achieved, the force also recognises it has more to do.
A list of goals not yet achieved includes areas such as regional cyber-crime units, Tusla information sharing, hate-crime policy, missing person status and human rights of the vulnerable.
Under the Internal Affairs heading, the report notes that during 2019, a total of 1,632 files were opened for dealing with discipline and complaints.
Twenty-four new suspensions were effected, resulting in 48 gardaí suspended at the end of last December.
A total 149 new compensation files were opened in respect of gardaí maliciously injured while on duty.
Ten cases were closed and 81 cases were awarded compensation in the High Court totalling €3,668,446.
A detailed analysis of statistics in the report shows that the 2016-2018 average for incidents of burglary was 1,485 a month while the 2019 average was 1,370.
In relation to robberies, the 2016-2018 average was 187 incidents a month while last year it was 195.
The incidents of assault average for 2016-2018 was 1,519 a month, and for 2019 it was 1,757.
Recorded incidents of sexual crime averaged 243 a month for 2016-2018 while last year's average was 278.
Dedication
A note on the report says the introduction of a new Pulse recording system in February 2018 means detections data from before and after the upgrade should not be compared.
"The dedication and determination of garda personnel to keeping people safe is evident throughout this report from significant drug seizures, ongoing reductions in burglaries, crime-prevention initiatives and daily community engagement," Commissioner Harris said.
The overall financial position of the force at the end of last December showed a total net expenditure of €1,669m, €3m less than the revised annual budget of €1,672m, which included a supplementary estimate of €18m.

Identity is the cultural driver behind the whole thing. We rejoice when we beat certain counties because of what we think that says about us and because of how we feel about them.
We take an unnatural pride in the achievements of the people from the places we're from, wearing the colours we've worn and supported.
Few experiences in life prompt the same extremes of emotion as backing your county. Few in my life can compare with playing for Dublin.
And when we gather to celebrate or commiserate or analyse, it's not just as followers of a football or hurling team. It's about our county, our club. Our people.
Rightly or wrongly we see ourselves differently when we win and we feel that pang of inadequacy or frustration or heartache when we don't.
We harbour ridiculous preconceptions about players or supporters or people from different counties because it suits our own narrative and the stories we like to tell ourselves.
'Such and such a crowd are windy' or 'those lads are full of themselves' or whatever.
The day that dynamic is removed from the GAA, either by splitting a county or amalgamating others, will be the day the GAA effectively sacrifices its soul.
Shortly after Pat Gilroy took over as our manager in 2009, he brought us out to the Poolbeg Lighthouse off Sandymount Strand.
It was a clear day and in one direction, you could see out as far as Dalkey in the deep Southside of the city. To the North, you could make out the coast and town of Sutton.
It might sound a bit schmaltzy but Pat wanted to hammer home that sense of who we, the Dublin football team, were, the place and the people we were representing every time we played and trained. And it resonated with a lot of fellas.
It's a privilege to play for Dublin. You happily give your life to it while you can.
I represented Dublin, the county. Not the Navan Road, where my club is. Or Castleknock, where I live.
But all of Dublin. Northside. Southside. Inner city. The lot.
And I can guarantee you that wearing that jersey meant as much to me as any player who ever wore their county colours.
Nobody has the right to take that privilege away from this generation or any future generation of Dublin footballers or hurlers.
So what's the issue here? If the major single problem is the Dublin footballers winning, then stop playing all their matches in Croke Park. End the obsession with the provincial system in the championships and make it an open draw or a group/knockout competition with no geographic stipulations.
Make a competition where they're as likely to play in Omagh or Killarney or Castlebar in the first round as they are in Croke Park.
And fund the counties that find it hard to make ends meet.
I saw Kevin McStay's proposal that Croke Park should meet the costs of travel and food expenses for county teams and I couldn't agree more.No county board should be forced to trim on those sort of costs or dip into their development budgets so their players are properly fed and reimbursed.
But what practical effect would splitting Dublin do?
Who would it benefit? Let's be honest about this. The answer is Kerry and Mayo. It wouldn't do anything for the weaker counties. Nothing.
Will Division 2, 3 and 4 teams suddenly rise up just because Dublin don't exist in their competitions?
And what value would an All-Ireland without Dublin be to Mayo or Kerry anyway? Not a whole pile, I'd imagine.
So what's the point? I accept that people might find it hard to see at the moment, but Dublin will be beaten.
It might not happen next week. But it will happen. I'm absolutely convinced of that.
I've no doubt they will continue to contest All-Irelands for the next decade because of the quality core of players, the management and the system, but it's highly unlikely they'll go the next three or four years unbeaten.
And I understand there's a sense of injustice at the moment, that people feel Dublin are being given an unfair advantage.
But the funding question is endlessly complex and at the moment, it's being portrayed as simplistic.
If you took all the money Dublin receive from Croke Park and divided among the rest of the country, all you'd achieve is to stop the growth in playing numbers in the biggest centre of population and leave many county boards with money they wouldn't know where to properly invest.
That won't happen. It's such an incredibly narrow way of looking at the GAA. Central intervention is required. No question.
If that means appointing full time CEOs in five or six counties with the structural potential to make the next step, fine - let's start with that.
Establish systems, a pathway for elite players, an overall coaching plan for the county, so they can create a culture that sustains. Because that's what's needed - not splitting Dublin.
That won't ever happen in my lifetime. It would amount to a disaster for the GAA, the beginning of the end of the inter-county game and a toxic pollution of way we define ourselves as GAA people.
Those who propose it should be careful what they wish for.

Drug-driving doubles as more of us are being killed on the roads

New garda statistics also show that despite a huge reduction in the volume of traffic during the Covid-19 lockdowns, the death rate on the country's roads has increased.
The figures were released as An Garda Síochána launched its Christmas and New Year road safety appeal and urged drivers not to drive after taking alcohol or drugs, lower their speed and be mindful of cyclists and pedestrians.
Assistant Garda Commissioner Paula Hilman, of the National Roads Policing and Community Engagement Bureau, said 136 people have died on Irish roads this year.
"That is eight more than last year in a time when traffic volumes were actually down as much as 70pc during lockdown restrictions," she said.
"Last weekend alone there were 85 alcohol detections and 26 drug detections on our roads.
"Even with reduced traffic volumes, there were 2,573 people found driving under the influence of drugs this year compared to the same period last year. That's an increase of 113pc.
In the same period, detections for drink-driving fell 24pc from 7,675 to 5,849.
Ms Hilman also said a new pattern has emerged where detections for drink or drug-driving are more evenly spread across the week rather than in a spike at the weekend.
It was unclear if Covid-19 was responsible for this shift in patterns of public behaviour.
Ms Hilman said speeding offences are up by 26pc this year to 151,000 cases so far.
Road Safety Authority chair Liz O'Donnell said increases in drug-driving and speeding have had a direct effect on road deaths.
She said the increase in detections of people driving while under the influence of drugs was of particular concern, and while there had been a drop in drink-driving detections, gardaí are "playing catch-up" with those driving after taking drugs.
Cocaine
"Passenger deaths are also up, and the non-wearing of seatbelts may be contributing to this," she said.
Ms O'Donnell said the latest figures show that where toxicology tests were carried out on road death victims, more than one-third had alcohol in their bodies, nearly 10pc had taken cocaine and more than 7pc had taken cannabis.
"The pubs may be closed because of Covid, but people are still getting alcohol and still getting into cars," Ms O'Donnell said.
"If you are drinking at home you have to be careful of the measures you pour. We pour twice the normal level at home without realising."
Hildegarde Naughton, the Minister of State for Inter- national and Road Transport and Logistics, urged tired drivers travelling long distances to stop for a caffeinated drink and take a 15-minute sleep before resuming their journey.
"Share the driving if possible, but don't try to fight off sleep behind the wheel," she said.
An Garda Síochána's Christmas and New Year safety campaign will run until January 5, and there will be high-visibility checkpoints and mandatory roadside intoxicant testing.
Professor Denis Cusack of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety said extra roadside testing units have been issued to gardaí to help in the detection of drink and drug use among drivers.

Judge Alison J Nathan has said she will decide later this month whether to conduct a hearing on a bail application.
Ms Maxwell (58) has been held since her arrest in July on charges that she pro- cured teenage girls for Epstein to abuse in the mid-1990s.
The British socialite has pleaded not guilty and is preparing for a trial next July.
Seeking bail, lawyers Mark S Cohen and Chris- tian Everdell said they have assembled a "compre- hensive bail package" in- cluding financial infor- mation and letters from family and friends who will support Ms Maxwell but want to keep their identities secret.
Reputation
Ms Sternheim said Ms Maxwell was being treated harshly in part because the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) wants to repair its reputa- tion after failing to prevent the suicide of Epstein last year in a Manhattan federal prison as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges.
"The conditions under which she is detained are punitive and unwarranted," Ms Sternheim said.

Exclusion of historical data 'not fair' in Leaving, court told

The claim was made by lawyers during the first day of the hearing of the lead challenge brought by a Leaving Cert student against the calculated grades process and awarding of college places for 2020.
Feichín McDonagh SC, for Freddie Sherry, said the minister had "jettisoned" her commitment to keep the process of estimating grades fair by opting not to include historical data about schools' past performances.
The minister's decision, counsel said, had also resulted in inflated  grades and had breached a second commitment to making the 2020 results comparable to those in past and future years.
Counsel said the process adopted by the minister was not panicked or rushed.
Considerable expert opinion was obtained as to the best way to fairly and accurately assess calculated grades.
Counsel said following what was a "top-down intervention" by the minister, it was decided not to include historical past data from previous years' performances by schools when it came to assessing grades.
Criticism
There was no requirement to exclude that data as part of the grade assessment process.
In addition, the system being used to calculate grades in Ireland was different to those used in the UK, where there had been wide-scale criticism after thousands of results were marked down to reduce grade inflation.
Mr Sherry, who sat his Leaving Certificate at Dublin's Belvedere College SJ, is the test case of around 50 challenges by other Leaving Cert students against the calculated grades process.
In his action, Mr Sherry, of Newtown, Celbridge, Co Kildare, claims a direction by the minister last August to remove school historical records in the calculated grades process resulted in him being unfairly downgraded by 55 points in his Leaving Cert.
Mr McDonagh said his client was hugely disappointed when his teachers' estimated CAO points total of 542 for him was reduced to 487 under the process.
He missed out on his first course choice of pharmacy at Trinity College.
The minister and State deny the claims and maintain there is no reason to believe Mr Sherry would be in an improved position if historical school data was included.

Fears that thousands of long-term patients will not get priority status

It follows the Cabinet decision to approve a provisional ranking of groups who will be first to be offered the vaccine based on need over 15 stages.
While residents of long-term care, including nursing homes, as well as frontline workers, are understandably top of the queue, there is concern about the exclusion of sufferers of rare but debilitating illnesses among people aged 18 to 64, who should be seventh in line for the jab.
Derick Mitchell, who represents various patient organisations, said: "There are patients who cannot participate in the 'new normal' in any way, they cannot 'risk it'.
"To protect their physical health, they must cocoon or self-isolate - completely, indefinitely, and some alone.
"Patients have endured this level of isolation for 10 months now and it is critical that they not endure this for a moment longer than is necessary."
The list of illnesses which qualify for the earliest access to the vaccine include chronic heart disease, high blood pressure, chronic respiratory disease, including asthma requiring continuous or repeated use of systemic steroids or with previous exacerbations requiring hospital admission.
Treatment
Also included are people with diabetes, chronic neurological disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity, immunosuppression - due to disease or treatment - and chronic liver disease.
Top of the list are residents over 65 in long-term care in HSE and private nursing homes.
Frontline healthcare workers will also be first in the queue.
It is expected Ireland will get around 300,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in early January if approved - enough to vaccinate 150,000 people.
Labour Party leader Alan Kelly said he was concerned the nine low-temperature refrigeration trucks imported into Ireland last week were nowhere near enough to meet the demands of a rollout.
Ireland will have to wait until possibly the end of the month for the European Medicines Agency to decide if it will approve the vaccine with a rollout here in early January.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil: "We are not strangers to national immunisation programmes, although this will be of a far greater scale than we have had so far."
This year's flu vaccine had "worked very well, notwithstanding all of the complaints and criticisms".
About two million people receive the flu vaccine annually, he added.
However, Mr Kelly said those not in higher risk categories will have to wait until the middle of the year for the vaccine.
They will have to continue to go about their daily lives without the protection of the jab, he pointed out.

Mobster Price wasn't jailed for an extra day

In a judgment returned yesterday, the three-judge court dismissed Price's appeal against a ruling that upheld how the governor of Wheatfield Prison calculated his release date on a three-year jail sentence.
Prisoners in Ireland are automatically entitled to a reduction of one quarter in their sentence in remission.
The court found Price's alternative calculation of remission - based on months rather than days - was "contrary to logic".
Lawyers for Price (38), of Rockleigh House, Richards- town, Gormanstown, Co Meath, argued "the appropriate and more correct way to calculate remission" and therefore the sentence re- quired to be served was to express it in terms of months rather than days.
Upholding the High Court's decision yesterday, Ms Justice Maire Whelan said the method of calculation of Price's standard remission was correct.
In May last year, the High Court dismissed Price's challenge on the basis it would create uncertainty and potential injustice if the length of a sentence varied depending on the time of year it was served.
Price was convicted at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in February 2017 on a count of recklessly engaging in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or harm.
The charge related to an incident at Balbriggan garda station on January 22, 2014, during which Price drove a van at high speed at Garda Gary Dillane, which forced him to jump out of its path.
In October, the Court of Appeal heard that Price, whose sentence began on February 17, 2017, was released from custody on May 18 last year after being entitled to a quarter remission off his full sentence.
Fraction
Price claimed he was advised by the governor of Wheatfield Prison that he was en- titled to be released on May 18, 2019 on the basis of serving three-quarters of his full sentence, calculated by days, once remission was taken into account.
The father-of-two maintained he should have been released on May 17, based on an alternative method of using months to calculate a fraction of a year.
Counsel for Price, Paul Carr- oll, said the current position of how the Irish Prison Service (IPS) calculated release dates was "very unsatisfactory" and not based on any statutory provision, rules or written policy.
He claimed an alternative method of calculating release dates based on months was "equally valid".
Mr Carroll said Price should have been released 24 hours earlier than he was from prison.
"It's not good enough when we are talking about someone's liberty," he said.
Counsel for the governor of Wheatfield Prison, Lorcan Staines, said the most numerically accurate way for calculating a release date as a fraction of a year was by days.
He pointed out that a rounding-down approach operated by the IPS had also benefited Price.
Ms Justice Whelan, who sat with President of the Court of Appeal Mr Justice George Birmingham and Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy, said the three-judge court were satisfied that the appellant's detention was lawful for the 24-hour period in dispute and the trial judge had been correct in his determination.
The appeal was therefore dismissed.

The results published in the Lancet yesterday are the first full peer-reviewed efficacy results to be published for a Covid-19 vaccine.
It comes as the roll-out of the Pifizer BioNTech vaccine got underway in Northern Ireland and mainland UK this morning.
Ireland has an advance purchase agreement to buy 3.3 million of the Oxford vaccine produced with AstraZeneca.
It has yet to be submitted for regulatory approval.
Yesterday's results state the vaccine was found to be safe, with only three out of 23,745 participants, over a median of 3.4 months, experiencing serious adverse events that were possibly related to the vaccine.
All participants have recovered or are recovering, and remain in the trial.
"The results presented in this report provide the key findings from our first interim analysis," said the study's lead co-author, Dr Merryn Voysey of the University of Oxford.
Booster
"The Oxford Covid-19 vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector that cannot cause disease in humans and expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
For the new study, the authors analysed data from 23,745 adults in the UK, Brazil and South Africa (11,730, 10,002, and 2,013 in each country, respectively).
The study pooled the data from these countries providing greater precision for efficacy and safety outcomes than possible in individual trials.
The trial was originally designed to assess a single vaccine dose, but a review of the immune response data found a second dose boosted immune response.

The alleged victim was unable to flee his attackers due to the "extreme level of violence used", gardaí said.
Zara McCabe (33) of Brookview Drive, Tallaght along with Michael Brown (38) and John Kavanagh (54), both with addresses at Fr McVerry's Trust, are all charged with assault causing harm.
Their cases were adjourned at Dublin District Court.
Gardaí told the court the man was allegedly attacked by the three accused at Fleet Street after 11pm on November 4. It was alleged he was walking on the street when he was knocked to the ground and "viciously assaulted" for several minutes.
He tried to flee but was unable to do so due to the "extreme level of violence" used. The garda said the incident was captured on CCTV from several locations.
Kicked
It was alleged the man was kicked in the head while he was on the ground and a witness had told gardaí he also saw the man being hit on the head with a hammer.
Ms McCabe was not alleged to have used a hammer, her lawyer said, and there was no weapons charge against any of the accused.
Ms McCabe was alleged to have rifled through the man's pockets, although there was no robbery charge.
The court heard neither of the co-accused was known to Ms McCabe.
When Mr Brown's case was called, a garda said the alleged victim suffered bruises around his face and a cut to his eye.
Mr Brown had made denials throughout his interview by gardaí, his lawyer said.
Judge Marie Quirke said the allegations were serious.
The three cases were all adjourned to different dates, for the directions of the DPP.
The charges are under Section 3 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.

Varadkar says Sinn Féin response to Stanley tweet controversy 'woefully inadequate'

Mr Varadkar said it "might not be a bad idea and could be helpful" if Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald made a statement to the Dáil next week, along with her party colleague.
Mr Stanley has already apologised for a tweet said to have been "glorifying violence" by the Provisional IRA in killing 18 members of the British Parachute Regiment at Narrow Water, Co Down, in 1979.
In addition, a 2017 tweet under his name marking Mr Varadkar's election as leader of Fine Gael, read: "Yippee for d tory. You can do what you like in bed, but don't ask 4 a pay rise in d morning."
Mr Stanley has claimed he is not homophobic and has worked to advance gay rights.
However, Mr Varadkar said: "It was something I was going to let pass, to be honest, and I didn't say anything about it until Monday, because I'm not sensitive and I'm not self-righteous and I don't believe in cancel culture.
"And you know, people say things that are homophobic, sexist or misogynistic, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're homophobic or sexist or misogynistic themselves.
"I think the test really is, how do you respond to what is being pointed out to you? How do you deal with it?"
Mr Varadkar said Ms Mc- Donald in her interview on Today with Claire Byrne on RTÉ Radio 1 on Monday had failed to deal with the issue.
"She tried to explain away what Deputy Stanley wrote, and it's not the first time either," he said.
Mr Varadkar gave the example of another Sinn Féin councillor who he claimed had "made remarks about me that were blatantly homophobic, and racist - and no action was taken by Mary Lou McDonald at the time".
"It was only when it was discovered that he had made misogynistic remarks about women that any action was taken," he said.

The star told the High Performance podcast he had a growth removed from his vocal cords.
Jones (46) said recovery had been a "very slow process" and he had to do lots of exercises with his voice to get it back to normal.
"I couldn't speak for about three days and then I could speak for two minutes and then I could speak for five minutes," he said, discussing how he felt after his operation.
"I was just reading like a chapter of a book out loud and then stopped talking.
"So it was quite a strange process. Then it was about learning how to sing again.
"I just had to go through all this very, very slow process, really, and try to regain the strength and the thing that's going to give me my whole kind of life."
He said the growth, called a trauma polyp, "could have been done by a bad cough or shouting at the football".
Jones also said he needed to take a break from the Stereophonics.
"I've clearly started to show people other elements of my talent, my personality, whatever you want to call it, even though I've been trying to do that through the brand of Stereophonics for 25 years, by making every album completely different and trying to change the sound," he said.
Jones described the band as an "amazing thing", but admitted: "I thought I was needing to walk away from it at one point."
He said he realised he was "not quite fulfilled", but now has much greater freedom with his work.
"I can go over there and do this project with these guys from Texas. Or I can go over here and do this other thing," he said.
"I can grow and get fulfilment from these other projects, which will only ignite the main gig."

Sean Kennedy (31) drunkenly told the garda to "f*ck off" and asked "who are ye".
Judge Dermot Dempsey convicted and fined Kennedy €100 for the offence.
The defendant, with an address at Swords Manor Crescent in Swords, admitted public drunkenness and threatening and abusive behaviour. Garda Mark Corrigan told Swords District Court that he came across Kennedy on the R132 Lissenhall around 4.30am on May 24.
Gda Corrigan said Kennedy was lying on the footpath.
Stand
He was unable to stand up and when the garda tried to help him, the defendant became verbally abusive.
Gda Corrigan said Kennedy told him "f*ck off" and "who are ye", the court heard.
Kennedy apologised the following day for his behaviour, Gda Corrigan said.
The court heard that Kennedy had 11 previous convictions. Defence lawyer Annette Kealy said Kennedy had relationship problems at the time of this offence, and he felt that life was getting on top of him.
Ms Kealy said Kennedy, a father of three, had split from his partner and was on medication for depression.
He had gone out with a friend and had had too much to drink.
Kennedy did not remember being abusive to the garda, but his friend had told him about his behaviour and he had immediately apologised.

Christmas and New Year 'could lead to 1,200 new cases a day'

Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan issued his strongest warning yet about another potential spike in cases after Christmas and New Year celebrations, which could cause a return to tougher restrictions.
He said the chances of a significant January escalation in infections is "more likely than unlikely".
Dr Holohan also pointed to "anecdotal" reports that, only days after reopening, there are overcrowded restaurants.
He appealed to people to "walk away" from such risky situations.
"If we are asking ourselves honestly how likely it is that we can avert a significant surge of infection in January, it's probably less likely than more likely," he said.
Experts told the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) that virus case numbers could, at a "conservative level", reach 300 to 600 a day by early next month.
However, Dr Holohan, in a letter to the Government last week, indicated the more probable scenario is 300 to 450 a day by New Year's Day and 800 to 1,200 by the second week of next month.
Asked last night about the prospect of a third lockdown, he said: "We don't want to be in the position where we have to make an assessment and recommend more severe restrictions."
However, he added: "If we have to do that, it is what we will do."
Abroad
Controlling the spread is reliant on individuals following the restrictive measures that are in place, Dr Holohan said, along with an efficient HSE response to quickly leap on outbreaks at an early stage and control them, stopping the virus spreading into the wider community.
However, there appears to be some concern about the strength of the HSE response if virus cases shoot up again.
The Government was also warned about the risks posed by Christmas homecomings by family from abroad as well as by people flying out on sun and ski breaks from Ireland over the next few weeks.
They could potentially bring the virus back with them and help to rapidly undermine the lockdown progress that was so hard won.
Dr Holohan was speaking as 242 more cases of the virus were reported yesterday, with no additional deaths.
Research carried out on behalf of the Department of Health highlights how people are now less concerned about the pandemic.
At the same time, there is a slight increase in the five-day moving average of the virus and a 13pc rise in the seven-day incidence rate.
Seventy-eight per cent of people say they are staying at home rather than going out compared with 90pc in April.
Overall, there is considerably less worry about the pandemic, which is leading to a rise in contacts and a stronger chance of passing on the virus.
There has been a fall in the numbers of people believing the worst is yet to come, and more are convinced we have now seen the grimmest days of the pandemic.
Asked about the possible arrival of a Covid-19 vaccine, Dr Holohan said the European Medicines Agency, which will decide if it will be given the green light for Ireland and other European countries, will not meet until the end of this month.
Our high-level task force charged with planning its roll-out will report by Friday, he added.

Go-ahead given to track Covid-19 in sewage water

The plan was endorsed at a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).
It means waste water will be analysed for coronavirus genetic material in the hope that sewage samples would indicate infection among people diagnosed with Covid-19 and those who have it but are without symptoms.
Dr Cillian de Gascun of the National Virus Reference Laboratory presented a report on the plan which, is particularly useful when cases are low because it allows an area to be the focus of testing to prevent the spread growing.
Warning
He said it would provide an early warning system to identify when the virus was increasing in the community.
It was proposed that the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre would implement a robust national wastewater surveillance network for the virus.
Research has shown minuscule fragments of the virus are shed by infected people in their faeces and urine.
In the UK, sewage from individual schools, universities, prisons and offices could be monitored to detect coronavirus outbreaks early.
In a paper released this week, experts from universities across the UK reported on pilot projects where waste water was shown to be an accurate indicator of infections in an area.
Traces of coronavirus are passed from people's bodies and can be picked up using genetic testing.
"Beyond identifying community-scale hot spots, waste water monitoring can be successfully applied at building scale for the management of outbreaks in discreet pop- ulations," the report says.
"Learning from our work in the small city, upstream pilot and in schools, we are investigating the potential to use building-scale monitoring to prioritise the distribution of mass testing, for example in prisons and critical points in the food supply chain."
The technique may also be used to track how successful the Covid-19 vaccination has been in protecting the population.
Separate work carried out by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control identified coronavirus material in London sewage in February before cases were diagnosed there.

Irish Water considers piping supplies from the North

The options are among many referred to in the company's first draft National Water Resource Plan which sets out to examine how Irish Water will source, treat and supply water over the next 25 years.
The task is likely to become more tricky and expensive as it grapples with a legacy of poor infrastructure, an expected 1.2 million surge in population, continuing climate change and associated droughts and floods, and new sources of chemical contamination and pollution.
It will also need to be able to support the construction of 34,000 houses a year for the next decade and a net increase of 660,000 new jobs over the full period of the plan, many in water-intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.
"Our infrastructure is under increasing pressure to meet the current demand," said Sean Laffey, head of asset management with Irish Water.
"How we choose to plan our water resources today will determine the water supply we can provide now and into the future."
Finishing
Over the next 10 weeks, finishing on February 16, members of the public can submit comments on the plan.
After that, Irish Water will publish four regional plans and invite public submissions on them before compiling the documents in one master plan.
All 749 individual water treatment plants will be assessed and options for additional, replacement or amalgamated plants, as well as ways to connect up some of the many very small supplies, and other infrastructural investment will be considered.
On the demand side, the aim is to find ways to avoid simply taking all the extra water that will be needed from existing sources.
For example, where there is a demand for 10 million extra litres a day, Irish Water says the plan would aim to supply six million litres, cut leaks by three million and save one million through ­conservation.
The company is calling this its 'lose less, use less, supply smarter' code.
Among the 'smarter supply' ideas are recycling waste water for use in industry, agriculture and horticulture; desalination plans that would use sea water for non-drinking purposes, and 'water transfers' which would involve linking with Northern Ireland Water.

The Sinn Féin leader had the following responses yesterday:
On Mr Stanley's tweet about IRA attacks in 1920 and 1979: In his tweet, the Laois-Offaly TD had drawn parallels between the 1920 War of Independence Kilmichael Ambush where 17 Auxiliaries died and the 1979 Warrenpoint attack by the Provisional IRA in which 18 British soldiers were killed.
Ms McDonald said the desirability of comparing the two attacks "will depend on your political vantage point". She also claimed the problem with the tweet was the "tone" and the impression to many that it was "perhaps even gloating".
She raised no issue with the Warrenpoint attack and was supportive when it was put to her that Sinn Féin's view is that the soldiers were legitimate targets.
Ms McDonald was later forced to admit Tom Barry, who led the 1920 ambush, did not support the Provisional IRA's 1970s campaign of terror.
On the Provisional IRA's bombing campaign, Ms McDonald said: "The facts are that we came through historically an experience of colonisation, dispossession, poverty and conflict and that's the reality of the history of our island."
On allegations Mr Stanley's 2017 tweet about Leo Varadkar was homophobic: When Mr Varadkar was elected Fine Gael leader, Mr Stanley posted: "Yippie 4 d tory. it's Leo. U can do what you like in bed but don't look 4 a pay rise in the morning."
Ms McDonald claimed the political charge levelled in the post "is not a homophobic one, it is of being a Tory".
On Mr Stanley staying as chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Ms McDonald said: "Absolutely he should.
"He has made mistakes and he will address those matters in the Dáil."
On a Sinn Féin member calling to a young activist's door telling her to remove critical tweets:
Ms McDonald said anybody can criticise Sinn Féin and claimed there is "nobody trying to censor anybody".
She also said she wouldn't think twice about "knocking on a cumann member's door".
On the reluctance of 55pc of Sinn Féin supporters to take the Covid-19 vaccine, Ms McDonald said: "There will be concerns for citizens, upstanding people, sane people, who will ask questions correctly about the vaccine." But the Sinn Féin leader added: "I will have the vaccine. Vaccines save lives."

People who had virus to get vaccine

It is hoped the first consignment will include 300,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, enough for 150,000 high-priority people.
But who is likely to be advised not to take the jab initially?
And if you already had the virus do you need to be immunised?
The National Immunisation Advisory Committee in the Republic will be the group that decides who should and should not get the Covid-19 vaccine initially.
However, it is likely their guidelines will strongly mirror those of experts in the UK where the vaccine is being rolled out this week.
PREGNANT WOMEN
UK experts have recommended that expectant mothers should not be offered it for now.
Although they are in a younger age group and would not be eligible for the vaccine until well into next year, the advice is relevant to pregnant healthcare workers, who will be among the first in line for the vaccine.
The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said so far, there is a lack of evidence of the effect of the vaccine, but said more research will be carried out.
Women who are planning to get pregnant within three months will also be excluded.
It said that data on vaccine impact on transmission, along with data on vaccine safety and effectiveness, will potentially allow for consideration of vaccination across the rest of the population.
As trials on children and pregnant women are completed, a better understanding will be gained.
Once a woman gives birth, she can be vaccinated. It will be important for women who are deemed at high risk of being exposed to the virus or getting very ill as a result of Covid-19.
CHILDREN UNDER 16
The committee also advised against immunisation in the under-16s because there is limited data on vaccination in adolescents, with no data on younger children at this point.
It suggests that only children at very high risk of exposure to the virus and serious outcomes, such as older children with neuro-disabilities, should be offered the vaccine.
The guidance allows for breastfeeding mothers to get the vaccine.
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY HAD THE VIRUS?
The vaccine will be offered to people who have recovered from the virus.
There have been a number of cases reported of people being reinfected, so there are no guarantees that recovery itself provides immunity to the virus.
A report by Hiqa, the health watchdog here, said immunity lasts for at least two to six months.
However, people who had the virus must continue to follow safety measures such as physical distancing and wearing a face mask.
Some experts believe that a vaccine could even work better on people who had the virus because they may still have some residual immunity left which is enhanced by the vaccine.
Some of the volunteers in the Pfizer-BioNTech trials had the virus but were unaware of it.
VEGETARIANS
Some vegetarians or vegans may be loath to take the vaccine if there are any animal ingredients in them.
Other, long-established vaccines, such as the nasal flu vaccine currently given here to children, contain pork gelatine.
Some can have hen's eggs, or cells from chick embryos.
It is still unclear what the full ingredients of the vaccines are, but experts believe they will be vegetarian - or vegan - friendly.
UK EXPERIENCE
Ireland will be able to learn how the rollout of the vaccine works in the UK, including the North, before the expected first consignment arrives later this month or in January.
There is already good news from the UK's medicines regulator, the MRHA, about the possibility of bringing the vaccine to nursing homes, which could potentially be copied here.
It was thought this would present difficulties because of the way the vaccine in packaged. But it has now confirmed it may be possible shortly.
The packs can be broken down into smaller consignments and distributed to nursing homes in about two weeks.
The vaccine doses must be repacked for transport to nursing homes in refrigerated cold rooms at between 2C and 8C and transferred into carriers that maintain the same temperature.
When these vials of vaccine are thawed, there is a window of just 12 hours to pack them and transport them to the nursing homes.
The MRHA said there "should be no doubt" about the safety of the vaccine.
The US regulator, the FDA, will meet on Thursday to decide if it will grant approval.
If so, the way for the vaccine should be cleared on Friday for the US.
That leaves Europe and countries like Ireland waiting for the green light from the European Medicines Agency which said it will meet before the end of the month.
Once it is approved, the wheels can be put in motion to transport it to Ireland and other EU countries.

The prop has been an Irish Cancer Society ambassador for several years after losing his mother Wendy to breast cancer when he was only 12.
The face mask is the latest venture in a wide range of fundraising projects Porter has done for the charity over the years.
Tattoos
"Cancer has affected my family as I lost my mum Wendy to breast cancer," he said.
"I wanted to do something to raise funds for the Irish Cancer Society to ensure that patients and their families continue to have vital access to support services when they need it most."
Porter has many tattoos with meaningful messages behind them, including one on his arm dedicated to his mother.
He has credited his artistic flare as the inspiration behind his latest fundraising initiative.
"My tattoos were a direct inspiration for my mask design," he said.
"I've always enjoyed drawing tattoo designs and my tattoos have been a lovely way to commemorate my mum."
Rosemary Simmons, the Irish Cancer Society's National Fundraising Lead, said Porter's work for the charity had been "incredible".
"We really appreciate An- drew giving his time to design this face mask," she said.
"It's been a very difficult year for cancer patients and their families, and the services the society provides are needed now more than ever."
Ms Simmons also expressed hope that the project will further highlight the importance of wearing a mask.
"By buying a mask, not only are you protecting members of your community, you are supporting cancer patients and their families across Ireland," she said.
The masks cost €15 and are available from the society's website.

Rugby star Toner helped to save neighbour who suffered a stroke

Toner (34) stayed with Joe Vanek until the ambulance arrived.
"I remember I was just about to get into my car when I saw that Joe had collapsed on the floor just inside his front door," said Toner
"It was clear he was in some difficulty and I ran in to see if he was OK.
"He had already phoned the ambulance and they arrived very quickly," said Toner, who has not spoken of his role in the 2019 emergency until now.
"I just did what anyone else would do in that situation and stayed with him.
"The ambulance crew and the medics did all the work and were brilliant. It's just great to know that Joe is doing well in his recovery."
Mr Vanek suffered his stroke while alone in his Dublin 8 home but he was able to call an ambulance before crawling to his front door to open it to see if there was anyone around to help him.
The ambulance arrived promptly but Mr Vanek said it was a comfort to have Devin there as he waited.
"He crouched down and put his arm around me because I was shivering," he said.
Mr Vanek had been brushing his teeth when he suffered what he described as "like a thunderbolt hitting the side of the head and I knew it was something totally serious".
"You just knew it wasn't a headache, it just came from nowhere and suddenly floored me and I just collapsed."
Mr Vanek (70) is the former director of design for the Abbey Theatre and design associate for the Wexford Festival Opera. He has been nominated for a Tony Award twice for the Broadway production of Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa.
He is also now a member of the Irish Heart Foundation's Stroke Support Group in Crumlin, Dublin.
"The stroke was caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain, resulting in reduced and damaging oxygen levels," he said.
A recent survey shows that almost half of people in Ireland would not call an ambulance immediately if they had suffered a stroke.
Just 55pc of them would dial 999 or 112 straight away.
The foundation's new Act F.A.S.T. (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) campaign warns stroke patients how crucial early hospital treatment is to limit long-term damage.
Kills
"On average, 21 people will have a stroke every day, but 10 of them do not know they need to get to hospital as quickly as possible," said Chris Macey, head of advocacy at the Irish Heart Foundation.
"When someone has a stroke, minutes matter and they cost real lives.
"A stroke kills two million brain cells every minute - and every 60 seconds saved between having a stroke to getting effective treatment saves one week of healthy life for a patient."
"While treatments for stroke have improved dramatically over the past decade, they still rely on people getting to hospital as soon as possible after experiencing symptoms.
"One of those treatments must be administered within four and a half hours of the stroke.
"But the HSE's most recent stroke register shows that only 59pc of people who experienced one got to hospital within four hours, whereas in 2015, 56pc got there within three hours."
The Ipsos MRBI survey also revealed that a majority of people cite slurred speech as one of the main warning signs of a stroke, followed by facial weakness, the FAST message and weakness on one side of the body.

Sinéad writes memoir on 'troubled' life

Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books and Media announced that the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter's memoir, entitled Rememberings, will come out early next June.
The publisher is calling the book a "revelatory" account of O'Connor's life, from her childhood in Dublin through to such triumphs as her cover of Prince's Nothing Compares 2 U.
The book will detail the singer's many controversies and her struggles with mental illness.
It will also recount her infamous appearance on the US comedy show Saturday Night Live in 1992.
O'Connor tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II on the show in protest at what she called the Roman Catholic Church's attempts to cover up child sexual abuse.
She announced on Twitter last month that she was postponing her 2021 tour in order to enter a year-long treatment programme for trauma and addiction.
Charmed
"This is my story, as I remember it. I had great fun writing it over the past few years," O'Connor said in a statement.
Deb Brody, the vice-president of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, described the book as a "personal account of a life both charmed and troubled".
O'Connor, who celebrates her 54th birthday today, is also known for her albums The Lion and the Cobra and I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got.
Her most recent full-length recording, I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss, was released in 2014.

'Even I didn't know the killer's identity, and I wrote the book'

She put on a dress, walked down to Rhodes House and found herself in a party scene with absolutely no idea what was going on.
The door opened and in walked the most beautiful young man she had ever seen, carrying a duelling pistol.
"I demand satisfaction," said Hugh Grant.
"He was stunning," Korelitz recalls, 40 years later, of the English actor who has just been seen in The Undoing, the glossy and addictive HBO adaptation of her 2014 novel You Should Have Known.
"You could tell as he crossed that room that he was going to be a star. He had so much charisma."
That charisma is what has kept viewers on both sides of the Atlantic nailed to their sofas on Monday nights for the past month to devour the thriller set in the chilly high-rise world of New York wealth.
Grant plays Jonathan Fraser, a paediatric oncologist whose carefully concealed affair with a mother at his son's elite private school suddenly bursts brutally into the life of his psychologist wife Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, when his lover is murdered.
Who killed Elena Alvez? Much like a young Hugh Grant, viewers have spent the past few weeks demanding satisfaction - and plastering their theories across the internet.
Korelitz (59) seems a little surprised when I ask her what she makes of the show's near-obsessive following.
She's speaking, she tells me over the phone, from a "very, very remote" part of upstate New York and, while she's on Twitter and Instagram, she informs me cheerfully, she doesn't "really understand the algorithm".
The result is that while she has "a weird feeling that something may be going on out there in the world", the hype around the show has left her largely untouched.
This means she has managed to remain innocent of the spoilers bouncing around the internet in the build-up to the final episode, which aired in the US the night before we speak.
"My son and I had a theory for who had done it, which turned out to be wrong," she tells me.
How is it possible that the author of the book didn't guess the ending?
Blame David E Kelley, the patron saint of gorgeous, starrily-cast yet somehow trashy dramas, most famously Big Little Lies.
It was he who took Korelitz's portrait of a woman whose perfect life suddenly implodes when her husband murders his lover and cranked up the thriller element.
On the page, the tension of the story resides in Grace's attempt to stitch her tattered life back together. On the screen, it's in the whodunnit.
Bluffed
Of course, as it turned out when the final episode aired, Kelley had double-bluffed us all: it was the psycho doctor all along.
Kelley steered the character away from Korelitz's original vision into Grant's comfort zone: Jonathan Sachs, the secular Long Island Jew, became Jonathan Fraser, the dry-humoured Oxbridge export.
Korelitz isn't bothered by the transition.
"I consider adaptation to be its own art form and I respect it. I'm not here to impede in any way," she says.
"I think David E Kelley is a genius, so even if I were inclined to, you're not going to interfere with Picasso."
She's also an Anglophile and has been a fan of Grant since that first appearance in Oxford.
"He's so cold in the part of Jonathan. Last night, there was one shot towards the end of the episode where there was nothing behind those eyes," she says.
"It really was a spectacular moment."
The character was inspired by an article Korelitz read years ago in New York Magazine's Best Doctors issue - a clipping of which can be glimpsed on the Frasers' bedroom wall in the show.
Something that one paediatric oncologist wrote somehow stayed with her.
"He said it was a privilege to be allowed into people's lives at their worst possible moment," she says.
"I thought, that's a beautiful sentiment - but what if you weren't a great guy?
"What if you were a person who's just drawn to that kind of intensity of emotion, not to mention the need to be the saviour walking into that room, the person who might be able to fix things, to heal your sick child?
"If you were the kind of person who perhaps wasn't very connected with emotions of your own, wouldn't you be fascinated by that kind of intensity?
"If you happen to be a sociopath, and you happen to be a doctor, you're not going to choose dermatology, you're going to want to go into a field where there's a drum roll every time you enter."
There's something particularly compelling about the spectacle of America's elite desperately trying to conceal its very dirty laundry.
"My son showed me this tweet from actress Issa Rae that said, 'Oh, I can't wait for tonight's episode of The Undoing. I love white people mess'," Korelitz says.
"You know, we all like to see the rich suffer a little bit."
Another attraction is undoubtedly the aesthetic: the hair, the clothes, those baroque Upper East side apartment interiors.
One Nicole Kidman coat in particular has broken the internet - a sweeping, moss-green number with a vaguely Pagan hood.
"I touched it once," Korelitz confides, like a guilty secret.
It was during one of her set visits, during which she nosed around the Upper East side locations and met Nicole Kidman's puppy, but nothing could beat that coat.
"It was chenille. It felt like a bedspread," she says.
As we slide into December, with no Christmas parties to look forward to, many fans of The Undoing will be daydreaming of a second series, Korelitz included.
"I would love it and I certainly have my own ideas, although I probably shouldn't say much," Korelitz says.
Where would she take the storyline, now Jonathan's villainy has been revealed?
"I think there's plenty more for Grace to confront. She's finally learned the big lesson about who she's been married to, so how does that impact every single one of her decisions about how to live?" she says.
David E Kelley, take note.

'Giuliani positive for Covid-19', says Trump

The president confirmed in a tweet yesterday that the former New York mayor had tested positive.
Mr Giuliani (76) has travelled extensively to battleground states in recent weeks in an effort to help Mr Trump challenge his election defeat.
Mr Trump wished him a speedy recovery.
"Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!" Mr Trump wrote in his tweet.
Mr Giuliani made an appearance earlier on Sunday on Fox News to speak about his legal challenges in several states on behalf of Mr Trump.
The diagnosis comes more than a month after Mr Trump lost his re-election bid to US president-elect Joe Biden and more than two months after he was ill with the virus in early October.
Since then, a flurry of administration officials and others in Mr Trump's orbit have also tested positive, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development.
Last month, Mr Giuliani's son, Andrew Giuliani, a special assistant to Mr Trump, said he tested positive for coronavirus.
"I am experiencing mild symptoms, and am following all appropriate protocols, including being in quarantine and conducting contact tracing," the younger Giuliani said in a November 20 tweet disclosing his Covid-19  positive test.
The extraordinary spread among Mr Trump's associates underscores the cavalier approach the president has taken to a virus that has now killed more than 280,000  people in the US alone.
Those infected also include the vice president, his chief of staff, the White House press secretary, advisers Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller, as well as Mr Trump's campaign manager and the chair of the Republican National  Committee.

'Warm, witty voice of golf' Alliss dies at 89

Length: 293 words

"Peter's death was unexpected but peaceful," the family said in a statement through the BBC. It did not provide a cause of death.
Alliss won 23 tournaments worldwide in a professional career that ended in 1974.
He played for Britain and Ireland in his first Ryder Cup in 1953 and then in every match from 1957 to 1969 and represented England 10 times in golf's World Cup.
He became of member of golf's Hall of Fame in 2012.
Legacy
"Peter made an indelible mark on everything he did in our game, but especially as a player and a broadcaster, and he leaves a remarkable legacy," European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley said.
With his deep and soothing voice, warm humour and passion for golf, Alliss may have been more renowned as a commentator than a player.
Golf Digest once called him "the greatest golf commentator ever".
Alliss made his broadcasting debut in 1961 as part of the BBC team covering the British Open at Royal Birkdale and became the channel's main commentator in 1978.
He also commentated on big tournaments in the US, Canada and Australia.
Among his many witty one- liners was this classic from 2002 when Tiger Woods shot 81 in the British Open: "It's like turning up to hear Pavarotti sing and finding out he has laryngitis."
Alliss wrote many books and co-designed more than 50 courses.
Born in Berlin in 1931, he was the son of British professional golfer Percy Alliss, who was one of Britain's top players in the 1920s and 1930s.
The Allisses are one of only two father-son duos to play in the Ryder Cup, with Antonio and Ignacio Garrido of Spain.
"No one told the story of golf quite like Peter Alliss," BBC director general Tim Davie said. "He captured golf's drama with insight, wisdom, and humanity.
"He brought the game to life for millions of us."

The couple welcomed their "miracle" twin boys just over a fortnight ago, less than a year since their daughter Sophia was born by gestational surrogacy.
Rosanna suffered 14 miscarriages before having Sophia, and attributes her twin pregnancy with Hugo and Oscar to slowing down due to the pandemic.
Cuddling
Taking to Instagram, the model said she wanted to share five things she and her husband have learned "just for fun".
Posting a picture of herself cuddling one of her baby boys, she wrote: "Just for fun, here are five things we've learnt so far from going from having none to one to three babies in the space of less than a year.
"1. As parents, we're a whole lot more relaxed this time around. When Sophia arrived, we barely knew how to change a nappy. Now we pretty much do it in the dark multiple times a night.
"2. Routine is key if you ever want to have the time to actually finish a hot cup of coffee and get that precious caffeine into your bloodstream.
"3. We still discuss who had a nappy explosion and when, but we chat about other stuff too, like which baby did a projectile wee on us and when.
"4. We reminisce much more about those heady days when we used to leave the house together on dinner dates and wonder when it might happen again. Could be two years, could be 10 years. Who knows?
"5. As a newborn, Sophia also taught us, you can live on four hours sleep a night and somehow not die."
To announce the birth of her identical twin boys on November 18, Rosanna (36) shared a snap of herself, Wes and the  new  arrivals.
"Our beautiful and healthy identical twin baby boys, Hugo and Oscar, arrived safely into the world this morning and our hearts are bursting with love,2 she wrote.
"Just like that, we've become a family of five and all our dreams have come true. We're deeply grateful to the wonderful, hardworking team a @nationalmaternity- hospital for all of their kindness and support."
Struggle
Hugo and Oscar were dubbed "miracle twins" as Rosanna and Wes had struggled to conceive.
The couple endured the loss of 14 early pregnancies on their journey to become parents, due to the former Miss World having a suspected autoimmune system issue.
In an interview on the Late Late Show last year, she said it was a "lonely, traumatic experience. I couldn't do what my body was biologically designed to do - reproduce".

Up to 50,000 people are expected to make the trip back to Ireland by air for Christmas amid the continuing Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Ryan said the Government is not encouraging people to return to Ireland but does recognise some will have to travel.
He said it could be someone with a lonely parent, who has been away for a very long time or who has to travel for work reasons, adding: "What we shouldn't be doing is shaming those people."
Speaking on Newstalk's On the Record with Gavan Reilly show yesterday, the Transport Minister said prospective air passengers are the best people to make the call on whether they really need to travel and he doesn't think it's up to the Government.
He said he checked with DAA - the agency that runs Dublin Airport - and the forward bookings for flights are "very low" at about 10pc of normal levels.
"The reality is there'll be far less people traveling and I think that's a good thing," he said.
He said more people may book flights at short notice but people will make their own decision on whether or not it is safe to travel, particularly if they are coming from high-risk countries.
"They won't want to bring home the risk of the virus to their own loved ones. So I think people will have to use their own judgment. And I think we should respect that," Mr Ryan said.
"We're not promoting a huge amount of people returning. We don't want to see a big influx because we do have to manage this."

The countless revellers who wined and dined at the city's Dawson Hotel, Sam's Bar and La Stampa restaurant will have the chance to pick up their very own mementos tomorrow and Wednesday.
The entire front facade of the city's Berkeley Court Hotel, complete with revolving doors, is also up for grabs.
The lots form part of a catalogue of items that also includes the roulette wheels, blackjack tables and dealer's chair from the former Silks Casino in the capital.
More than 1,400 lots will be auctioned in the Niall Mullen Signature Auction at Eureka House in Kells, Co Meath.
The Dawson Hotel sale includes a "lifetime's collection" of items amassed by former owner Louis Murray.
"He put his own stamp on it around 15 years ago, he had lots of style about him," antiques dealer Mr Mullen said.
"Whether it was the lighting, soft furnishings or gilt bedroom furniture, everything is of very good quality. The decor included eastern and Moroccan themes, so it was all a bit different.
"He put in individual pieces of furniture, lighting and got things made. The copper- fronted lights were designed for Sam's Bar and it was worth going in and taking those out carefully.
"The Art Deco lights on the bar are similar. The large mirror in the hotel is eight feet tall and was bought in Cooke's Antiques.
"One of the light fittings is designed as a hot-air balloon. They had massively high ceilings and this was to make a statement. "It's unique."
Mr Mullen is co-ordinating the no-reserve sale in partnership with Victor Mee Auctions.
It took a month to strip the contents of the hotel, Sam's Bar and La Stampa, which were then transported in five containers to Meath.
Included are the sound and DJ equipment from the Dawson, disco lights and turntables and 80 pairs of lamps.
Charity
A miniature green and white replica Irish phone box is expected to fetch between €2,000 and €3,000, with the sale proceeds going to suic- ide prevention charity Pieta House.
Lots from Roly's Bistro in Ballsbridge, items from the estate of the late Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, a set of alabaster lights from Dromoland Castle in Co Clare and a wine display table from Fallon and Byrne on Dublin's Exchequer Street will also feature.
Organisers said that keeping with government guidelines, those living in Meath can attend viewings and the auction, but by appointment only with Victor Mee.

The incident happened in Dundalk on Saturday night and came only hours after another officer was injured during a hit-and-run in the town.
A suspect will appear in court this morning after being charged in relation to the assault.
Threatening
It happened at around 9pm in the Glenwood area after a man was arrested over a small drug seizure.
Gardaí were making enquiries with a second person in relation to the drugs operation when the attack happened.
The man became threatening and abusive to two officers and assaulted them.
During the incident, one garda was punched and headbutted, resulting in injuries to his face and hands.
He was later hospitalised with concussion but was later discharged.
A second garda was also assaulted but did not require medical attention.
The suspect was arrested at the scene and was taken to Dundalk Garda Station.
It was the second incident within a number of hours that left a garda in Dundalk hospitalised.
Earlier that afternoon, at around 1.45pm, an officer from the Roads Policing Unit suffered a broken collarbone after being dragged along a motorway by a car that had failed to stop.
The hit-and-run happened on the M1 at Jonesborough during a routine traffic stop and the suspect vehicle was later discovered burned-out in Dundalk.
The officer was taken to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries and was later discharged.
"No arrests have yet been made in relation to that incident and investigations are ongoing," gardaí said in a statement.
"We are appealing for witnesses to come forward and are also appealing to road users with camera footage, including dash-cam, from along the M1 route at the time of the incident to make it available to investigators.
"Anyone with information is asked to contact Dundalk Garda Station on 042 938 8400, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any garda Station."

Man claims he was tricked in €51,000 laundering case

Dean Coleman (24) maintained he was tricked by others into giving out his PIN before the money was lodged in his account in six fraudulent transactions, a court heard.
Judge David McHugh said he needed to hear further evidence of how Mr Coleman allegedly benefited from the transactions before he can make a decision on a venue for the case.
Mr Coleman, of Dodsborough Cottages, Lucan, is charged with possession of €51,179 that was the proceeds of criminal conduct.
Blanchardstown District Court heard the offence allegedly happened at AIB, Main Street, Lucan, between June 12 and 27 last year.
Sergeant Maria Callaghan said the DPP was directing summary disposal of the case at district court level.
Evidence
Outlining the evidence for jurisdiction purposes, Sgt Callaghan alleged the accused acted as a money mule by allowing his bank account to be used to launder €51,179 in six fraudulent transactions.
Sgt Callaghan said €25,000 was successfully recovered, but the remainder had already been withdrawn.
It was alleged Mr Coleman was tricked into handing over his PIN and Iban number, and he told gardaí he continued with the transactions against his will.
Sgt Callaghan said at the time it was not accepted by gardaí that this account was credible, but they did accept the accused was "not the major beneficiary".
The judge asked if there was any evidence of how Mr Coleman allegedly benefited from the offence.
Sgt Callaghan said gardaí would say he received a "contribution" for allowing his account to be used.
The figure involved was "quite large", the judge said.
It was a complicated file, Sgt Callaghan said, and the investigating garda would be able to provide more information.
Judge McHugh said he had to hear "every fact" before finalising the issue of jurisdiction.

"We have always presented The Crown as a drama - and we have every confidence our members understand it's a work of fiction that's broadly based on historical events," a Netflix statement said.
"As a result, we have no plans - and see no need - to add a disclaimer."
It is understood that very few complaints have been made to Netflix about the content of series four.

He had been facing mounting calls to appear before fellow TDs following a series of controversies.
On Wednesday, he publicly apologised for a tweet sent last weekend, which appeared to glorify historical killings of British soldiers by the IRA.
However, he said he has "no apology to make" over a 2017 tweet he sent that appeared to comment on the sexuality of Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar.

Channelling his best Dublin Moore Street accent, Owens declared: "That's the last of them now," as the sole remaining blue Cavan GAA shirt - to fit a one-year-old - was sold.
Buffeted by the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, business owners and customers yesterday had just one topic on their minds: Cavan's dream All-Ireland weekend.
As well as the David versus Goliath All-Ireland senior football semi-final matchup with Dublin at Croke Park, Cavan's camogie team line out today in an All-Ireland final - the Premier Junior decider against Armagh, at Cavan's Kingspan Breffni.
"It's a huge weekend for Cavan GAA and everyone is proud of our men and women," says Mr Owens, who is also chair of Butlersbridge GAA club.
"We've no shirts left. People have been buying flags for their gardens and blue bunting and hats which have flown out the door."
"It's a tremendous end to a tough year and it has given people such a lift."
However, when it comes to discussing the colour blue in Cavan, things are a little complicated. Owens acknowledges that some of his customers are, shock horror, Dubs.
"Blue is definitely a Cavan colour, it's not a Dublin colour," says Mr Owens.
"But there is a big population of Dubs who have moved here in recent years, so some of them have been in buying flags."
That's exactly what Brittaney Hennessey was looking for yesterday when she jumped out of a taxi on the edge of town to buy some Dublin merchandise from a street seller.
"I'm from North Strand originally but I live in Belturbet," she said.
"This flag will only drive the neighbours mad. Dublin all the way."
Cheering
Business owner Conor McEntee opened the doors of his Krave Cafe yesterday after six weeks of lockdown.
Sporting a Cavan shirt, he said he would be cheering on one of his own friends and regular customers - Cavan wing-back Ciarán Brady.
"The lockdown has been tough, and Cavan suffered more than most, so it's been special to see the lads give the whole county a lift," said Mr McEntee
The team has worked hard for this and they're sure to give Dublin a tough game. The whole county is on a high and there is a feel-good factor around the place."
Eight kilometres away in the village of Ballyhaise, postmistress Susan Brady was busy serving customers and finalising her arrangements for tomorrow - as Cavan GAA's PRO, she will be among the select few Breffnians at Croke Park.
"Every man, woman and child in Cavan would have filled Croke Park," she said.
As for the outcome, Ms Brady was defiant: "We're not going to Dublin for the spin and we're certainly no 'Cavan joke'.
"We will give them a game as Ulster champions, that I can guarantee. Cavan abú."

'Long hours and bullying forcing docs to emigrate'

The report from the Medical Council, the regulatory body for medical professionals in Ireland, found more than half of doctors said they were working more than 40 hours a week.
One doctor who worked 90 hours a week said they were treated like robots.
More than 1,100 doctors left the medical register in 2019, many blaming lack of support, excessive hours and resourcing issues.
The report showed that 23,558 doctors are now on the medical register in Ireland and 84.6pc are active.
It highlighted the strong reliance on junior doctors from abroad to support the Irish health service and the ongoing level of attrition resulting from lack of access to training, poor working conditions and natural retirement.
In 2019, there were 1,135 doctors who left the register, with the majority planning on working in another country.
16.2pc of those who chose to leave the register cited limited career progression in 2019, compared to 14.8pc this year.
At 26.6pc, more than a fifth cited family/personal reasons for withdrawal in 2019, compared to 25.1pc this year.
Some doctors said they were not returning to practice in Ireland due to poor working conditions in comparison to the country in which they are currently practising, and that experienced doctors who qualified outside of the EU could not access formal training programmes.
These challenges impact directly on patient and professional safety, the report warned.
"Poor working conditions - hours, workload, support pay," commented one doctor in the report.
Burnout
"Poor employer support, poor options for progression, poor pay, poor conditions," said another departing doctor.
"Provision of safe, quality patient care is challenged, as doctors report; working in poorly resourced services, working in excess of the European Working Time Directive hours, poor pay and burnout, said Jantze Cotter of the Medical Council.
"This results in ongoing attrition of Ireland's highly trained and experienced medical workforce.
"The patterns highlighted in previous reports are repeating themselves in 2019 and 2020.
"Only a commitment of collective, coordinated and planned action across stakeholders will produce solutions."

'Splash the cash and save Irish jobs,' retailers urge

Spending across the country is expected to double the normal Christmas daily levels as shoppers rush to take advantage of the first weekend of trading after Level 5 lockdown restrictions were eased.
Irish business associations and chambers of commerce expect only December 12, 19 and 20 - two Saturdays and a single Sunday - to rival the spending levels predicted for today.
The sales surge has also led to an avalanche of bookings for restaurants and cafes - with many now booked out for every Saturday in December.
Tide
"A rising tide is hopefully going to lift all Irish ships, shops, hotels and restaurants," said Kingsley Hotel manager Fergal Harte.
Stores and shopping centres will now operate extended opening hours up until December 24 and consumers were urged to "shop local" and back Irish producers given the huge challenges posed by the pandemic.
Retail Ireland, business associations and chambers of commerce said there were "very strong signs" that the 'shop local' message was being firmly heeded by Irish consumers.
December's retail spending will now soar to €1.2bn above that of September.
Normal monthly retail spending in Ireland is slightly less than €5bn.
Strong spending has already been reported on electrical goods, luxury items and fashion.
An estimated €52m a day will now be spent until December 24 - with the bulk of the spending predicted for the three weekends before Christmas Day.
Peak sales are predicted for the weekends of December 5-6 and December 12-13, when it is estimated that more than €10m an hour will be spent nationwide.
Dublin Town's Richard Guiney said it is a critical trading period for all retailers.
"They need your support more than ever before - we are encouraging people to shop local and support Dublin traders in the run-up to Christmas."
Mr Guiney said the 50pc increase in public transport capacity was critical to them.
Dublin Town, which represents city centre traders, said that despite the sales surge, it expects footfall or the number of shoppers in the capital to drop by between 24pc and 33pc compared to Christmas 2019.
An average Irish family is expected to spend €700 to €800 more in December than in the other 11 months of the year.
Household spending could increase still further this month as some people dip into money saved over the pandemic lockdown.
Retail Excellence Ireland boss Duncan Graham said it was critical that consumers support local traders as he said many were now entirely dependent on a strong Christmas trade.
"Retailers have been counting down the days to getting their doors back open. It is vital we get retail fully moving again to help Irish retailers survive into 2021."
Closures
But he warned the retail environment remains very turbulent, as evidenced by the recent high street closures in the UK.
He said Irish retail will see closures but he was optimistic these would not happen before early or mid 2021.
Cork Business Association President Eoin O'Sullivan said many traders needed a strong Christmas to survive into 2021.
"It is about supporting local traders and local jobs.
"Our members are doing their utmost to ensure everyone's safety and implementing Covid-19 protection guidelines."
Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway have all organised more expansive festive lighting programmes to attract shoppers - while Christmas festivals have been 're-imagined' to allow for social distancing and safe attractions.

'Terrible tragedy' - speeds of 120kph led to deaths of four friends in Donegal crash

Pals John Harley, Shaun Harkin, Mícheál Roarty and Daniel Scott all died when the Toyota Corolla car they were traveling in crashed at Gleannhulaigh near Magheraroarty on January 27, 2019.
All four had been drinking together in Dixon's Bar in Magheraroarty.
However, sometime after 8.30pm the men left in Daniel Scott's car.
Just minutes later, the car went out of control after it clipped a grass verge and flew 23 metres into a field.
Mícheál (24) who was from Dunlewey, John (24) from Falcarragh, Shaun (22) from Falcarragh and Daniel (23) from Gortahork, were killed instantly in the crash.
Hugged
The car was extensively damaged during impact as it landed on its roof.
Pathologist Dr Katrina Dillon gave details of their post mortems and told how all four pals suffered serious head injuries which had ultimately caused their deaths.
Families of the four young men, who were hugely respected in their local communities, sat and hugged each other during the distressing evidence at Letterkenny Courthouse.
The court was told that all four men were intoxicated.
Forensic Collision Investigator, Garda Gerard McCauley gave a report on what caused the crash. He told how measurements indicated that the car was traveling at a speed of 120kph on a road governed by an 80kph speed limit.
The weather was not a factor, the road was in good condition and the car was also in a good serviceable condition at the time of the accident, he added.
He said there was no time to correct the swerve in the car when it happened.
The court was told that two of the men, Michael Roarty and John Harley, were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash.
However, coroner Dr Denis McCauley said this would not have saved the men as the impact and the nature of the crash had been so severe.
Dr Dillon said that all men were intoxicated and that the driver, Mr Scott, was six times over the limit and that cocaine was also found in his system.
Witness Seana O'Grady told the coroner's court that she had been in Dixon's Bar that evening and saw the four men.
After they left the bar, she said she heard the revving of a car engine out the back and that another witness Adam Curran said: "Oh God, why didn't someone take the keys off them?" She said that was the last time she saw the men.
Another witness Ivan O'Donnell told how he was first on the scene after parking his car in a driveway after it ran out of petrol.
He saw a car in the field with its lights on, the noise of the horn constantly sounding.
Garda Shaun Sharkey was the first member on the scene and told of the horrific site he found.
He said he knew there were two bodies in the front of the car and two in the rear but was not sure if there were more casualties in the rear such was the damage caused by the impact.
He said, along with the emergency services, they removed the bodies from the wreckage and placed the bodies on tarpaulin sheeting and cleaned them up as best they could.
Local priest Fr Brian Ferry arrived and blessed all the deceased. A local doctor from the NowDoc service also arrived on the scene and officially pronounced the men dead.
Members of the men's families officially told the inquest of identifying their loved ones.
Sgt John Joe McClafferty paid tribute to all the men who perished on the night as he said he lived in the community, knew some of them well and had attended all their funerals.
He said that Mícheál, John, Shaun or Daniel had never come to garda attention before and were from very well-respected families in the area.
He said "This was just a terrible tragedy and it was said at the time that this was one of the darkest and saddest days in our community as four young men were snatched from us in the prime of their lives."
He paid tribute to all who attended the scene on the night including the emergency services.
"They did all they could on the night," he added.
Blame
Coroner Dr McCauley said the inquest was not being held to apportion any blame to any of those involved in the crash but merely to find out the facts of what happened on the night.
In conclusion, he said that all four men died as a result of injuries sustained from a road traffic collision and his finding was a verdict of misadventure in each case.
He added "This was four close friends out enjoying themselves and made a couple of decisions which had a bad, dreadful outcome."

'We've already set up a table for the final' - Dublin Gerry'

The five-in-a-row winners' last All-Ireland football semi-final drew an 82,000 sell-out crowd on an August evening as they beat Mayo on their way to retaining the Sam Maguire cup.
However, the pandemic has led to this year's game being played on a cold December evening with no fans allowed into GAA Headquarters.
It means there's been no rush for tickets, and the streets around the stadium today won't be filled with fans awaiting throw-in or touts offering last-minute tickets.
Plans
Instead, Dublin fans are supporting their team from home or in the pubs around Croker - and are already making plans for the final later this month.
Gerry Gowran, better known as 'Dublin Gerry' in GAA circles, has been going to Dublin games since 1958 and today's match will be the first major fixture he has missed in over half a century.
He told the Herald: "We have to go by the rules. If we tried to get into (Croke Park) and got in, it would only start World War 3.
"It would only be causing trouble so we have to bite the bullet. The coverage on television is excellent in fairness so it will have to do." The confident Dubs fan is already looking past the challenge Cavan will put up and is making preparations for the final on December 19.
"We're setting up a table with gear for the final and using a laptop.
"I'd say they'll win by about eight or nine points.. The team train themselves at this stage after seven years with Jim (Gavin).
"They're self-motivated and can move up a gear at anytime. Cavan will give it a go in the first half hour and then bang, Dublin will go into overdrive. I'd love to see them get eight medals and match the great Kerry team."
'Dublin Gerry' also said he is looking forward to things getting back to normal and fans are welcomed back into stadiums.
"We have to just completely accept it and get it into the brain cells that it's a non-runner. Once Christmas comes and it goes back to league, we'll hopefully be back down the country."
He also said he would be remembering another legendary Dublin supporter and good friend Tony Broughan who sadly passed away in September.
Tony was one of Dublin's best-known supporters and was always seen at Dublin games in Croke Park and Parnell Park dressed as Molly Malone.
Noel McMullen, whose family have been based around Croke Park for three generations and are loyal supporters, said he will be watching a Dublin game from home for the first time in years."Before the matches, there would always be a gang of us in the pub and having the craic and the banter. That won't happen this year which will be strange, everything is just strange the way we're living at the moment.
"You can't go to the matches or even shake hands, it's strange and something you'd never expect.
"It's sad to see all these people dying and I wish there was something to stop it. People are trying their best. We have to go by the rules. You'd never be happy not being let in (to Croke Park) but everyone has to go by the rules and do the right thing. What's good for the goose is good for the gander."
Like many loyal Dublin supporters it will also be the first semi-final Noel will miss since the Dubs claimed their first Sam Maguire this century in 2011.
However, he said fans will find a way to create a buzz before the game and cheer on their team. "I think we'll win by six or seven. They know what to do and the way they're playing, they should match the great Kerry team," he said.

Leah Barniville (18) is asking fans who watch the video to make a donation to Debra Ireland, the charity which provides day-to-day help and support for people with the painful skin condition epidermolysis bullosa (EB).
EB causes the skin - both inside and out - to blister and wound at the slightest touch and the only treatment for the condition is painful bandaging to prevent infection.
The singer from Ratoath, Co Meath, said she wanted to do what she could to support Debra Ireland.
Supporter
"My dad has been a supporter of the charity for some time now and for the past couple of years I have held concerts for other charities," said Barniville.
"Part of their work is to fund research programmes to find better treatments and possible cures for EB, and I am delighted to do whatever I can to help that."
O Holy Night is the latest in a series of singles from the talented soprano, whose appearance on talent competition Britain's Got Talent wowed the judges and has been viewed more than 50 million times on YouTube.
In 2017, at the age of 14, her operatic voice prompted a standing ovation from all four judges and the audience in both her audition and semi-final, helping to kick start her career.
"Performing on Britain's Got Talent was a really amazing experience which gave me the opportunity to sing in amazing venues such as the Royal Albert Hall, which was one of the highlights of my career so far," she said.

Gareth Connolly (43) had met a friend after work for drinks on the Liffey boardwalk during the first lockdown in April when gardaí questioned him and he became abusive.
Judge Bryan Smyth fined him €200 after he admitted public order offences in the incident.
Connolly, with an address at Captain's Road in Crumlin pleaded guilty to public intoxication and using threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour to cause a breach of the peace.
He was not charged with any offence in relation to being outside the 2km limit.
Dublin District Court heard gardaí saw the accused drinking with another man at the boardwalk at Eden Quay last April 18.
Threatening
When asked where he was from, he initially said Pearse Street but his address was in Crumlin, the court heard. The garda informed him he could not be more than 2km from his home at which Connolly became threatening and abusive.
He was intoxicated and was arrested. Connolly had been working full time at a construction site on Pearse Street when his friend got out of hospital and they met on the boardwalk for a drink, his lawyer said.
It was a "very low grade offence" and the court had no evidence of what was actually said. Connolly accepted he was outside the 2km and that it was incorrect for him to go drinking after work.
At the time, he had just finished working on a contract.
Judge Smyth imposed the fine on the breach of the peace charge and took the other into consideration in view of the accused's guilty plea. He granted free legal aid after hearing Connolly was not working.

Dublin Lord Mayor Hazel Chu yesterday launched Dublin City Council and Alone's cold weather campaign outside the Mansion House, which is urging members of the public to check in on older people in their community this winter.
Ms Chu said, "These colder winter months can be a difficult time for many older people who are vulnerable and may be feeling anxious and isolated.
"We are appealing to all Dubliners and indeed people across the country to be mindful of older people in our communities who may live alone or be at risk of struggling with loneliness, health difficulties or fuel poverty."
She added: "The Cold Weather Initiative represents the community and the entire city working together to make a difference in the lives of older people, many of whom are facing worries about warmth, shelter and essentials such as food and medication at this time of year.
"I am confident that local communities will respond with kindness, compassion and goodness to support older people throughout the winter."
Alone is also encouraging older people to prioritise their spending on heating during the winter months.
The organisation has staff ready to act on requests for assistance and can advise on issues relating to food, heat, utilities or medication.
Seán Moynihan, CEO of Alone said: "We regularly work with older people who don't have central heating, live in challenging housing conditions, and even people who have used their free travel and stayed on buses and trains during the day to keep warm.
Mortality
"Colder temperatures can have a serious impact on the health and safety of older people, and Ireland has among the highest levels of excess winter mortality in Europe.
"It's really important that we reach out to people who may be finding things difficult due to ill health, financial worries, or housing difficulties.
"We hope that by spreading this message and by reaching out, more people will stay safe and well this winter."
He added, "We have services all across the country that can offer advice and assistance to those in need of additional supports this winter.
"According to reports from TILDA - The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, around one-in-ten older people have problems heating their home, and nearly half have experienced problems with damp, mould or mildew.
"We encourage anyone who may be concerned about their own well-being or someone else's to reach out for assistance.
"We want people to know that Alone is here to help with any problems they may have this winter season, from housing conditions to loneliness," Mr Moynhan said.
Contact Alone on 0818 222 024 if you have concerns about your own well-being, or the well-being of a vulnerable older person in the community.

Reality check as report warns lockdown may have been lifted too soon

The reality check was delivered in a report from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) yesterday, saying the risk of Covid-19 infection this Christmas is high.
The European experts suggest an extension of "school holidays" or a time of distance learning could be considered after Christmas.
It comes as six more deaths and 265 cases of the virus were recorded here yesterday.
A technical issue which had delayed uploading of lab results to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been resolved. It led to a reduced number of cases reported in recent days.
Although shops resumed business here on Tuesday and restaurants and gastropubs opened their doors yesterday, the ECDC told member states that lifting restrictions early may lead to a faster rise in infection.
Stronger
Lifting lockdowns on December 21 may cause a rise in hospitalisations in early January, but removing them before December 7 may lead to an increase even by Christmas eve.
The earlier they are lifted, the faster the cases, hospitalisations and deaths rise, it said.
Ireland's 14-day incidence at 78.3 per 100,000 puts it in a stronger place than most other European countries.
Yesterday's figures show a fall in the number of patients with Covid-19 in hospital, down to 232 from 239.
The number in intensive care is down from 32 to 27.
Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said: "If you are heading out this weekend, please make every effort to keep safe.
"Plan ahead, meet outside where possible and keep your contacts to a minimum.
"Avoid crowded or poorly ventilated spaces and leave if your environment doesn't feel safe."
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: "We are now entering an important phase in our collective efforts to suppress spread of the virus.
We have made significant progress and reduced transmission in our homes and communities, but it will take a consistent individual effort from everyone to keep up that momentum in coming weeks.
"I urge you to use the public health advice on regular handwashing, social distancing and wearing of face coverings to safeguard you and your family from the devastating impact this virus can have, especially on our most vulnerable people."

The RTÉ broadcaster took to Twitter to reveal how she was left bloody and bruised after she rebuked a motorist who beeped at a child who was cycling with her.
She wrote: "This summer a woman beeped at a child I was cycling with.
"When I stopped and suggested this was unacceptable, she put her hand around my throat, throttled me, then pulled her nails across my neck drawing blood. This is not appropriate behaviour on our roads."
The brave presenter revealed she had reported the incident to gardaí and shared a picture of her neck and shoulders covered in bruises and red scrape marks.
The meteorologist revealed that she was spurred to post about the incident in a bid to highlight the need for safer conditions for cyclists.
"I'm well over this incident, I didn't post about it at the time. It was in May.
"Unfortunately, the ongoing beeping at children (my own child on his way to school included) is what brought on this tweet."
The broadcaster was inundated with support from her followers including cycling lobby group the Dublin Cycling Campaign.
They wrote: "8-year-olds shouldn't have to worry about motor traffic on their cycles to and from school.
"The solution is straightforward: Segregated cycle routes across our urban areas which enable people of all ages & abilities to cycle. That's it."
Followers also responded, with one person writing: "This wouldn't be tolerated in boxing or wrestling, but she thought it was OK to do on the street in front of children.
"I know this year has pushed people's buttons, but that's still assault. Did you get the reg?"

€10k damages offer over scalded infant 'too low', says judge

Barrister Veronica McInerney told Judge John O'Connor that toddler Reidin Caponi, who was still learning to walk, had passed out from the pain when she kicked over a coffee cup that had been left on the floor.
Ms McInerney, who appeared for the child with Murray Flynn Solicitors, said the creche owners, D2 Montessori, in Upper Camden Street, was offering the infant, who will be three just two days after Christmas, a settlement of only €10,000.
Attacks
"Knowing the circumstances of this case I could never recommend that the court accept such a low figure to compensate Reidin for what she has gone through," Ms McInerney said.
"I know that this child could not bear to allow anyone touch her foot and suffered panic attacks at bath time or if she had to go into water."
Ms McInerney said the settlement sum on offer by D2 Montessori failed to reflect the true value of the case and would never be enough to compensate Reidin, who claimed through her mother Mairéad Carroll of Grianan Fidh, Aikens Village, Dublin 18.
Judge O'Connor, who said the offer was considerably short of what it should be, was told the child had subsequently been brought by her father, Roberto, to her GP who referred her to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.
Ms McInerney said Reidin had come under the care of Dr Patricia Eadie, a consultant plastic surgeon at St James' Hospital and had to attend the burns dressing clinic on several occasions.
"Reidin cannot bear to put her foot in the bath and under no circumstances could I recommend such a sum as an adequate figure for compensation," Ms McInerney said.
Reidin's mother told the court in an affidavit that the incident had been hugely traumatic for her daughter.
The scalding cup of coffee should never have been left on the floor of the creche where a child could stumble into it, she said. Judge O'Connor, having seen pictures of the injuries to Reidin's foot, said he could not approve the offer and the court was of the opinion the true value of the case was in the region of €25,000.
He adjourned Ms McInerney's application to rule on the offer until January to allow the child's legal team to bring the court's views to the attention of the creche owners.

'Nothing like the roar of the Hill', says Dubs legend

In September, Dubs superfan Tony Broughan, who spent decades dressing up as Molly Malone complete with dress and wig, waved his bell for the last time.
The stalwart fan was a regular on the Hill and although the stands will be empty, Tony's son Terry will be outside with his son Tighe carrying on the tradition.
"I'll be dressing up in the wig and the dress in the Dublin colours, and ringing his bell. Dad will be there in spirit and someday we'll get back onto the Hill in his memory," said Terry with pride and emotion.
"We're all heartbroken, but we'll keep it going and we'll keep his spirit alive," he added.
Terry and son Tighe will listen to the game from outside Croke park, getting as close as they can to the action while keeping themselves and everyone else safe as the quest for six titles in a row gets one step closer.
The Covid-19 pandemic nearly even killed-off the championship entirely, but the GAA found a way.
The weather will be colder and the game will be played under floodlights, but Dubs legend Barney Rock, father of six-time All-Ireland winner Dean, says the biggest difference on the day will be the lack of a crowd cheering the two teams on.
"It will be a big difference for supporters who will have to watch from home or socially distancing somewhere, but it will also be a big difference for the players. There's nothing like the roar of the Hill," he told the Herald.
Barney earned his place on the All-Ireland winner's list in 1983, and his son Dean has collected six All-Ireland medals, earning his first in 2013, and the rest in the five-in-a-row between 2015 and 2019.
"It will also be hard for Cavan. They have great supporters and always feel their presence, and Croke Park is a big place when the stands are empty," he added.
There was massive excitement last year when Dublin were aiming to reach the elusive five-in-a-row, but this year has been a more subdued affair.
But Barney says Dean and the team will be treating tomorrow's game like any other.
"They will have that drive. They'll take nothing for granted," he said.

Bassist
Along with receiving a tribute from the president, U2 bassist Adam Clayton will also be making an appearance.
Sharon will then be joined by several well-known Irish musicians including Donal Lunny, Denise Chaila, Steve Wickham, and Mundy to perform some of her most famous songs.
Sharon's brother Gary and niece Caolinn O'Donovan will also be joining her for the trad session, providing them with a nice family moment this Christmas.
Also appearing on the line-up is Adam King, who captured hearts around the country after appearing in last week's Late Late Toy Show.
Six-year-old Adam from Cork told host Ryan Tubridy that he dreams of working for NASA at ground control.
He had ambitions of being an astronaut before, but said he'd be unable to due to his 'brittle bones'.
After the show, NASA tweeted their support for Adam.
But tonight's programme will be extra special as Adam (6) will be chatting not just with Tubridy, but also with astronaut Chris Hadfield.
Although retired now, Hadfield had an incredibly successful career. He was the first Canadian to walk in space, and flew two space shuttle missions, as well as serving as commander of the International Space Station.
Later Tubridy will be joined by Take That frontman Gary Barlow.
Productivity
He'll be talking about his productivity during lockdown and performing his latest single.

Yesterday, a petition with more than 50,000 signatures was delivered to Cork University Maternity Hospital.
It called for partners to be allowed to attend for antenatal appointments and scans, for the duration of labour and after birth on the postnatal ward.
The petition will also be delivered to other maternity hospitals in the coming days.
It was organised by Caroline Cumming, a healthcare worker who is pregnant with her third child.
At the moment, most women must attend antenatal appointments alone.
Partners are also not allowed to attend during the earlier stages of labour.
Visits are also restricted after birth when the mother and baby are required to stay in the hospital.
Speaking at an online "rally" against the restrictions yesterday, Ms Cumming insisted the rules were causing major stress and upset.
"At this stage of the pandemic, with the knowledge and the resources we have, there absolutely must be a way to safely allow partners to accompany women at all times, and to give them the support that they need after the birth of their babies," Ms Cumming said.
"Nobody is asking for general visitors to be given free access to hospitals. We just don't consider fathers and husbands as general visitors.
Ms Cumming's petition was hosted by Uplift Ireland. Uplift carried out a survey of more than 700 people, including 500 women who either are pregnant or had given birth during the pandemic.
The women surveyed had attended 14 of the 19 maternity units across Ireland.
Asleep
A quarter of those surveyed disagreed that maternity services had "endeavoured to enable partners to be present at the birth of their child so that no women goes through labour alone".
The survey also included stories from women who had been left without their partners after labour.
One woman detailed how she had been left alone in the hospital without her partner following a caesarean section.
The woman had fallen asleep with a baby in her arms, and the baby had fallen off the bed.
"I hadn't slept in 48 hours and I was exhausted and fell asleep with her on my chest.
"I didn't have the help of my partner as he was asked to leave the hospital 20 minutes after our daughter was born," the woman said.
In one case a woman's breastfeeding was affected as she struggled to walk to the ward's water station as she had had an episiotomy and did not want to leave baby alone.
The survey also found that a number of people were choosing to pay for private ultrasound scans to try to ensure they could bring their partners with them.
Speaking at the rally, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said: "Pregnant women cannot be left in this awful, painful, hurtful traumatic limbo."

Cavan bring energy and chaos to Croker

While Cavan will bring their slingshots with them they will need something extra special to slay the Dubs.
However, upsetting the odds is nothing new to Mickey Graham's men and they will arrive in Croke Park buoyed with self-belief following their first Ulster title success in 23 years, having defeated a hotly-fancied Donegal.
In advance of the Ulster decider the general narrative was that not only were Donegal going to win, but that they were the team shaping up best to topple the Dubs.
So Cavan are probably a bit bemused, and no doubt it's something of a motivational force, that they have not been bequeathed that title of 'best of rest', despite their fully deserved provincial success.
While capturing the Anglo Celt Cup came as a shock, it did not come from nowhere - a lot of great work has gone on in the county over the last decade at underage and they were rewarded for that.
Having only won two previous Ulster U21 titles (1988 and 1996) the Breffni Blues won four titles in a row from 2011 to 2014 as well as an Ulster minor title in 2011. They also won three Gerry Reilly U16 Tournaments from 2014 to 2016.
Also in 2018, Down native Andre Quinn returned from England, where he had spent 11 years working as a strength and conditioning coach in professional rugby, nine and a half seasons with London Irish and the rest with Harlequins, to take the job as Cavan GAA's Head of Athletic Performance. It was a signal of growing intent and ambition.
Several things emerged about this Cavan team over the course of the Ulster Championship, one that began for them in the preliminary round when they defeated Monaghan after extra-time.
Firstly, they seem a very united squad and are willing to work themselves to exhaustion for each other - that is not always the case with teams and if you have any weak links there are none better than the current Dublin players to expose and exploit any shortcomings in that department.
Mickey Graham, has made some shrewd decisions in terms of selections, tactics and changes in personnel during games and there is great trust between manager and players.
Graham is also known for his 'giant-killing' acts having led Longford's Mullinalaghta to Leinster club glory in 2018 - beating then Dublin champions Kilmacud Crokes in the final.
It was the first occasion a Longford side had contested a senior provincial decider - so landmark victories are nothing new for the Cavan Gaels clubman.
Against Donegal, Graham deployed Jason McLoughlin on Ryan McHugh as well as different markers on security duties around Michael Murphy at various stages of the contest. It worked very well as it disrupted the axis of this pairing that usually play such a central role for their county.
Cavan also created frantic energy and chaos. Their intensity, work-rate and physicality in the tackle didn't let Donegal settle in the early passages of the game as Cavan moved into a 0-5 to 0-2 lead inside just ten minutes.
Against Donegal, Graham's men forced their opponents into numerous turnovers which led directly to seven Cavan scores - a very impressive statistic by any measure.
They'll look to take those levels of energy and chaos up a notch against the Dubs in Croke Park tomorrow to try to pose questions which no team has managed in this year's Championship.
Another trait of this Cavan unit is the comeback heroics they have performed in all their games.
In all their encounters - against Monaghan, Antrim, Down and Donegal - they trailed at half-time, but their will to win coupled with impressive conditioning has got them over the line.
Against Monaghan they were seven points in arrears at the interval, down 0-6 to 0-5 to Antrim, trailed Down 1-4 to 0-0 inside 12 minutes and were ten points behind at one stage, while against Donegal despite leading 0-5 to 0-2 early on were then outscored 0-7 to 0-1 during the 10-minute spell of Killian Brady's black card and entered the half-time break 0-9 to 0-7 behind.
They have an ability to kick long-range points and this will be needed against the Dubs while they have also got great momentum and scoring contributions from their bench.
Their physicality and intensity can also have its downside, however. They have picked up eight black cards during their Ulster campaign and the loss of any players against a team of Dublin's ruthlessness and scoring efficiency could prove fatal.
They certainly have the ability and personnel to cause problems for Dublin.
In goalkeeper Raymond Galligan, who kicked the winner from a 55-metre free against Monaghan, they have a man who has contributed saves at crucial junctures, against Antrim and Down especially.
Cavan also have variety in how they play. They are not afraid to go with the long ball if it's on and no doubt Thomas Galligan will spend time parked in front of Stephen Cluxton tomorrow evening. But they can play the patient, possession game also with Gearóid McKiernan the key man when they opt for this tactic.
They will also try to force Cluxton to kick long and make the middle third something of a war zone. While Donegal won good possession in this area, Cavan bottled them up successfully at times and will hope to frustrate Dublin equally.
In his two years in charge of Cavan, Graham has brought greater flexibility to their defensive play also with nominal forward Chris Conroy capable of operating as an extra defender to try to give greater stability to the spine of their defence.
For all that there have been inconsistencies in Cavan's displays and they will have to step it up even more from the best aspects of their performance against Donegal - and still that mightn't be enough.
I think Cavan will pose problems for Dublin but then this Dublin team always seem to find a route to victory - so I expect Cavan's fairytale season will not continue on to Christmas week.

Country back in business as we're set for a €50m party

Around €50m will be spent on hospitality over the next three days, making up 10pc of their expected yearly income.
Data from real-time online booking network Opentable.com shows many of Dublin's most popular restaurants and gastro bars are fully booked tonight, with only limited outdoor seating available at some venues.
This comes as the country faces icy, wet and windy weekend weather.
However, business owners in the hospitality sector, who have been desperate to open after a turbulent eight months, are expecting a profitable few days.
Decorations
The Hole in the Wall pub on Blackhorse Avenue in Dublin - a venue renowned for its spectacular Christmas decorations - is no longer taking online reservations after its system crashed on Wednesday.
Owner Martin McCaffrey told the Herald they received more than 1,500 emails in two days from customers looking to book a table in Europe's longest pub.
"We've had to put two staff on the switchboard to ring people back to confirm bookings, it's been manic," he said.
The Shelbourne Hotel, where one night will set you back nearly €500, is fully booked for the weekend as Dubliners continue with tradition.
"Many choose to mark or celebrate Christmas in The Shelbourne, and while this year's celebrations will be different and gatherings will be smaller, our guests are happy to adapt their tradition as required," said sales and marketing director Yvonne Donohue.
This weekend will be one of the busiest of the year for the hospitality industry as families and friends gather to celebrate the end of a six-week lockdown.
Cafe en Seine on Dawson Street received 140 bookings yesterday via Opentable.
Some business owners learned harsh lessons after the last re-opening, with many losing out due to no-shows and last-minute cancellations.
La Peniche restaurant on the Grand Canal - like many others - now requires deposits.
"As the restaurant is on a boat, we don't store our food and have to buy it fresh every day," marketing manager Wayne Lawlor said.
"Last time, there were 11 no-shows and cancellations in the one day and the owners lost out on a lot of money."
One Cork restaurant, Luigi Malone's, said it had every available booking for Saturday dining until the New Year snapped up in just three hours of the booking system going live.
General manager Morad Gharib said they were stunned by the high level of interest.
"We went live for bookings after it was confirmed that restaurants would be allowed to re-open for the Christmas season. It was absolutely crazy," he said.
"We thought the booking system might crash because the demand was so great."
Around €10m will be spent on food and beverages across Cork over the next 48 hours.
Cork members of the Irish Hotels Federation, Restaurants Association and Cork Business Association said today and tomorrow could emerge as among the most important trading periods of the entire year for pandemic-hit retailers.
A survey of 10 Cork restaurants revealed not a single available booking for tomorrow and next Saturday night.
Tony McMahon, who oper- ates Waterford restaurant Bellissimo, said bookings have been very heavy for Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.
Hotels are also experiencing a surge in demand, despite being hamstrung by the inter-county ban that remains in place until Dec- ember 18.
Honor Byrne, the commercial director of the Cliff at Lyons Hotel in Kildare, said bookings "look great" for the weekend.
"We have a few rooms left, but I think they will fill as there's a lot of interest," she said.
"The people of Kildare are ready for a break or a night away after the lockdown and are looking forward to treating themselves or loved ones in the run-up to Christmas."
Successive lockdowns have battered the hospitality industry in Galway, but Padraig Lally, who owns Taaffes Bar on Quay Street, is feeling positive for a busy December.
Parties
"This weekend, you see it, people are out and in the shops. Galway is waking up again and it's great to see it," he said.
"December normally kicks off early for us with work parties, but obviously there's none of that.
"I think people will come out and support us. Most of our bookings are done online and I've seen them flooding in over the past few days."
Adrian Cummins, the CEO of the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI), said it has been a "hectic" few days as the hospitality sector prepares to re-open.
"December usually makes up 30pc of the hospitality sector's profits," he said.
"We're expecting at least €50m across the board."

Drivers warned to slow down as cold snap bites over the weekend

Met Éireann said that a widespread frost began yesterday with some icy stretches on untreated surfaces.
AA Roadwatch has urged motorists to take care saying "wintry showers can affect visibility and mean a sudden change to road conditions".
Brake
"Slow down if driving and allow yourself more room to brake, as it can take up to 10 times longer to stop a vehicle on icy roads.
"Allow extra time in the morning to fully de-ice your vehicle before setting out."
It comes as Met Éireann issued status yellow warning alerts for snow, ice and wind in Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo.
A status yellow wind warning was also put in place yesterday for Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Waterford.
According to Met Éireann, this colder weather first began on Tuesday with the arrival of a cold polar maritime air mass sweeping across the country.
"Daytime temperatures will be in low single figures and night-time temperatures will be around zero or lower at times," a forecaster told the Herald.
"Most of the showers will be of rain and hail but some will turn wintry, particularly over high ground with some snowfall likely."
The change in weather is being caused by a polar jetstream growing over the North Atlantic, which is helping to block the high pressure system.
Snowfall
"However, as this cold air moves over the relatively warm seas of the North Atlantic, the depth of cold will be modified resulting in a wintry mix with snowfall mainly restricted to high ground.
"But some snowfall on lower levels will be possible at times later this week."
Saturday will bring further scattered showers to coastal areas, and highest temperatures will reach 5C to 8C with an added chill factor.
Sunday should, however, be a largely dry day with light variable breezes.

Irish is the new normal as Connell creeps into top UK baby names' list

The BabyCentre study has found Connell, a name known within every Irish and British household, after the massive popularity of the hit drama, has entered the top 200 UK baby names.
However, Marianne has failed to enter the girls' baby list, perhaps illustrating Connell and his chain would seem to have had more of a cultural impact in the UK among new mothers.
Although not an Irish name specifically, Vogue has also entered the list of UK girls' baby names for the first time - while Theodore rose 10 places to number 31 in the boys' list, this year.
Model and DJ Vogue Williams, who's very much an A- lister in the UK, along with former Made in Chelsea star and husband Spencer Matthews, are parents to two-year-old Theodore.
Kian
Other Irish names on the boys' list are Aiden at number 26, Liam at 32, Ryan at 43, Kian at 51, Finn at number 67 and Gabriel, which is 72nd on the list.
The girls' list has also witnessed the Irish effect.
Freya is number nine on the list, Erin is at 56, Orla is 81 and Niamh is in 100th place.
It seems lockdown TV has heavily influenced the list this year.
More babies than ever before have been named Tiger in 2020, after the huge popularity of Netflix's thrilling documentary, Tiger King.
While Arabella, the heroine of BBC comedy drama, I May Destroy You, also rose 30 places to number 57.
Another lockdown hit, Emmy award-winning Netflix comedy series Schitt's Creek, has also perhaps influenced the popularity of David and Alexis on the list.
George has become the seventh most popular name on the list, possibly reflecting the influence of Prince William and Kate's son, born back in 2013.
Optimism
The Muslim culture in the UK was very apparent on the list, with Muhammad the number one on the boys' list, while Olivia was knocked off the top girls' name list and replaced by Sophia.
Nova and Neo also made the top 200, the names meaning 'new' rose in popularity as did Hope, signalling a feeling for optimism as we approach 2021.

So it was amazing to see him not only play, but play well and keep a clean sheet in the Champions League three days later. There was a lot of pressure on him and, to his credit, he rose to the occasion. It's a huge boost for him to get to play in such an important game.
I remember what a thrill it was for me to make my Premier League debut at 17. You don't believe it's happening for you and I am sure Caoimhín had that sort of feeling on the night, yet came away with a huge smile on his face.
He has to be very happy to be number two 'keeper at a club like Liverpool, but the next stage of his development is also key. There is no point going out on loan to a Championship or a League One club for a while, just to get games. He should be aiming for a loan spell at another Premier League side, like Dean Henderson has done. The move into first team football takes that bit longer for goalkeepers and he has to be patient, while also being proud of what he has done this week. If he has the trust of Jurgen Klopp that he's good enough to play for Liverpool's first team in the Champions League, then he should be good enough to play for other Premier League teams and that should be his aim.
He might play this weekend, depending on Alisson's fitness, he could get a game in the Champions League next week as Liverpool have already qualified and he should also have some FA Cup and League Cup games to come, so he could get around 10 appearances, which would be huge.
If I was him I'd be hugely encouraged by what Jurgen Klopp said after the Ajax win, that he picked Kelleher because he was comfortable in possession, that he could pass the ball.
There's no rush for Kelleher now, He should stay at Liverpool, learn what he can there, fill in for Alisson when needed and then show next season just what he is about.

Let families go to the finals pleads Treaty's Morrissey

His side will battle it out with Waterford on Sunday week in the first ever All-Ireland final to be played behind closed doors and the Ahane club said it would be great if family members were allowed to attend.
He will at least have his brother Dan with him in the dressing room as the brothers bid to repeat their 2018 All-Ireland success, and while he welcomes the decision to allow full squads to attend, Morrissey said that family members should also be accomodated.
Capacity
"I don't think a big stadium like Croke Park, I don't think there is any reason why it couldn't be made possible. You're looking for maybe 500 people in an 82,000 capacity stadium," said Tom Morrissey.
"I know it would mean a whole lot to the players. It would mean a huge amount.
"I see over in England this weekend they're going back trying crowds in sporting games - it's an outdoor arena and I just think it would be nice and it would be safe.
"Playing the All-Ireland final next week, just such a big moment in our lives and not to have those people that are so important to you at the game and to share those moments in the immediate aftermath of a game.
"You go to your family and those people who are with you and supported you all through the years. Not having them there is disappointing and it would be nice if the GAA, I don't know if they are, could look into maybe getting family there," he added.
Meanwhile, the Gaelic Players Association and the Women's Gaelic Players Association are moving ever closer to a merger, writes Frank Roche.
The GPA and WGPA confirmed that they have issued notification to all members of separate extraordinary general meetings to take place on Monday week, December 14.
The purpose of the EGMs is to discuss taking the necessary steps to allow for the formal amalgamation of the two associations as one new combined players' association.
Voting on motions that would allow for this to happen will take place.
The move comes after motions were approved at the GPA's and the WGPA's annual meetings last year to formalise the "extremely positive relationship" that currently exists between the two player bodies.
Players from both bodies will now make the final decision on whether or not they want to become part of one new players' association.

Ahmed Yagoub (56) is accused of grabbing one alleged victim and performing a sex act on himself in front of other teenagers in three separate incidents in the same public park.
He had a book of evidence served on him at Dublin District Court.
Judge Paula Murphy sent him for trial to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.
Mr Yagoub, of The Crescent, Millbrook Lawns, Tallaght, is facing four charges.
He is accused of sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman last July 11 and offensive sexual conduct after allegedly following two 16-year-old girls into the park on June 26.
He is also charged with assaulting two young women in the park on July 4.
The judge gave him the formal warning that he had 14 days to provide any alibi evidence.
Financial
She granted free legal aid after defence barrister John Griffin said the accused's financial circumstances had not changed since his last court appearance.
Mr Griffin said there was a number of child complainants. There were notices of evidence regarding video recordings of statements by the children.
The court previously heard Mr Yagoub replied "I didn't do it" and "I didn't do anything" to the first two charges.
Garda Sgt Fiona Clifford said that on June 26, two 16-year-olds were allegedly followed by a man into the park, where they saw him masturbating.
The court heard the accused told gardaí he saw the girls in a shop and he was in the park but suggested he may have been urinating.
On July 11, two friends aged 19 and 17 went to go to the toilet in some bushes.
The 19-year-old noticed a man behind her, and when she pulled up her trousers he allegedly grabbed her by the buttocks then pinched her between her legs over her clothes.
The friends saw the man had his genitals exposed.
Mr Yagoub told gardaí he denied any sexual offence, the court heard.
No details of the July 4 allegations have yet been heard.

After leaving the camp, Farah said: "He's a lovely kid and I think I found my best friend for life."
He added that Pritchard (26) is driven for his age, saying he was not "doing half of what he's doing" when he was the dancer's age.
"He just gives 110pc, that's what I like about him," he said. "He never complains about anything, he just gets on with it."
Farah (37) said he "just clicked" with Pritchard. He added that he is pleased at making it as far as he did in the competition.
Happy
"I'm happy with where I finished and the best thing is getting out to see my family and to get back to normal life," he said.
Farah said he had been in touch with his wife since leaving the camp.
"I had a good chat with her for the first time last night," he said. "I told her how much I missed her, how much I'm looking forward to seeing her and the kids."
TV presenter Vernon Kay, podcast host Giovanna Fletcher, actor Shane Richie and radio DJ Jordan North are the only remaining contestants.
Soap star Jessica Plummer, classical singer Russell Watson, Coronation Street actress Beverley Callard and BBC journalist Victoria Derbyshire have already been eliminated from the castle.

Old Trafford's fear factor is a long time gone

But when I was at Everton and Aston Villa, particularly at the peak of the Alex Ferguson era, the approach was to try and keep the score down when you were away to Manchester United - they were that good.
In fact, you didn't want to play that United side at home or away because they could simply pummel you.
They'd come at you from the left wing, right wing, through the middle, from set pieces. They could have a slow build-up or attack with speed. They had it all and when you tried to attack them, they'd do everything in their power - including fouls, if needed - to stop you from scoring.
That United side would put in a dirty tackle, commit a professional foul, to stop us getting something against them, especially at Old Trafford. Now, I can't think of a single Premier League team who'd fear being thrashed at Old Trafford.
And I don't see anything close to that desire in the current United side that would make me, as an opposing player, fear them.
Teams now would fear Liverpool and Manchester City, just for the way they play. They dominate you, they push you back, grind you down, smother you with pressure.
But not United. They can score goals, put a nice move together but they will also give any team a chance in a game.When United press now, they don't do it with intensity, so any team that plays them know they'll have the opportunity to attack.
I watched the United versus Southampton game last weekend and what struck me was their lack of speed in passing the ball. Harry Maguire will get the ball, roll it out to the left back; he'll roll it into midfield; the midfielder will roll it up to one of the forwards. I watch Liverpool and Manchester City - Chelsea as well - and the ball just moves so much faster, they fire passes into team-mates which creates the tempo for the game. I don't see that tempo with United
That fear factor is long gone, more evidence of that this week with United's defeat at home to PSG.
This United side is certainly not capable of winning the Champions League and they'll struggle to even compete in the Premier League, that's a distant objective for them now as they are just too inconsistent.
It's impossible to have confidence in United putting a run together.
Presuming that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's  team go through to the knockout stages of the Champions League, most of the other teams in the competition would fancy playing them in the next round - and that's a terrible indictment.
United have one big result in them but it's more difficult to do that over two legs in Europe.
It's difficult to put your finger on what's wrong at Old Trafford. They have some really good players, they win some games where you think, that's it, they have turned a corner now, but suddenly they just drop off and it's back to where they were.
Whether that's down to the manager or the players' attitude, I don't know.
United started the week knowing they needed one point from the last two games in the group to get into the knockout stage... now they need to go to Germany and get something in Leipzig.
Istanbul is where it all went wrong for United in Europe this season. The games with PSG and Leipzig were always going to be tricky but they started well, beating PSG in Paris and thrashing Leipzig 5-0 at Old Trafford.
They had done the hard bit and Istanbul away was their chance to make progress a lot easier, but the 2-1 defeat in Turkey was a big letdown and now they are paying a very high price for that failure.
I'd still expect United to go through, they play well away from home. They seem to like it when teams come at them and attack them, so they can counter-attack - and they have picked up some good wins that way. The way the next game is set up, Leipzig having to win, suits United, they can play on the break.
So they should make it out of the group but it's a far from ideal situation, with a tough away game in Germany to qualify. It should have been put to bed before this and it just sums up the inconsistency that haunts Manchester United.
Solskjaer should have taken Fred off at half-time in that PSG game as he was already on a yellow card.
You need your manager to make decisions at the right time, but Solskjaer just carried on in hope. He should have been cuter.
United have West Ham this weekend, which is a big game for former Old Trafford boss David Moyes. The Scot is creating a proper team there - they are very dogged, winning games by the odd goal.
The Hammers flirted with relegation earlier but now they look like a solid top-half side, they will be awkward for most teams to play against but especially for United at the moment.

Serial compo claimants hatched 'grand scheme' to get insurance payout

Dismissing each of their claims for up to €60,000 in Tullamore Circuit Court yesterday, Judge Karen Fergus said all four men had "grossly exaggerated" their claims and had knowingly misled the court about a single car collision in Granard, Co Longford, in 2015.
Judge Fergus said she would have expected the men to know what is required of them when they speak to solicitors and doctors, given the number of compensation claims they had previously been involved in.
They confirmed under cross examination that none of their previous compensation claims had come before a court.
The judge said all four men, who were passengers in the single car collision, seemed to be "most unfortunate" given the number of accidents and incidents that had befallen them in recent years.
The court heard evidence that the four men had received tens of thousands of euros between them in out-of-court settlements for earlier road traffic accidents and matters such as the purchase of a bad tin of beans.
Brothers Brendan Leddy and James Leddy, of Granard, Co Longford, as well as cousins Edward Stokes and Michael Stokes Jnr, of Edgeworthstown, Co Longford, had been passengers in a Ford Focus car driven by Brendan Leddy's wife, Emma O'Keeffe, when it hit a stone wall or ditch in Granard on Sunday, January 25, 2015.
Garda Justin Browne attended the scene and noted all four passengers were out of the car when he arrived and none reported any injury.
He noted the car seemed to have hit part of a ditch and that damage to the car was "minimal".
All four men brought personal injury claims for up to €60,000 each against Ms O'Keeffe's insurance company, which was fully defended.
Overturned
They claimed they had gone to chop wood on the day in question and they gave varying accounts of how the accident happened. At one stage, Edward Stokes had claimed the car had overturned.
At the end of the case, counsel for the defence, Keith O'Grady BL, applied to have each of their claims dismissed as false and misleading under the Civil Liability Act 2004.
Judge Fergus said she did not believe the accident happened in the manner as alleged or that the men sustained the level of injuries they claimed.
"Despite their description of the impact when the car hit a wall, not one of them had a scratch, cut, bruise or broken bone," she said.
Judge Fergus said she had a duty to look at all the evidence presented to a court and to ensure that no injustice could be done to a worthy claim.
Having done so, she said she was "entirely satisfied" this was a "grand scheme put together" by the four men with the aim of "pocketing compensation" from an insurance company.
"All of their complaints were typical of injuries alleged in these types of cases which are almost impossible for doctors to discount."
She dismissed their claims, awarded legal costs against them, and refused to put a stay on the award of costs.
The court heard Edward Stokes was involved in a road traffic accident in May 2010 and thinks he got €9k for this.
In September 2010, he was stabbed at a wedding and got €5,500 compensation.
In February 2010, he sued a supermarket for food poisoning over what was described as a bad tin of beans and got €2,000.
In August 2012, he sued another supermarket for another bad tin of beans and got €2,000.
In May 2013, he was held up in a bookies at gunpoint and got €5,000 compensation.
In October 2016, a lady drove out in front of him in Dublin and the insurance company settled for €28,500.
The court heard Mr Stokes was shot in the ankle in 2018.
In June 2020, Mr Stokes was involved in a hit and run car crash but took no claim.

Philip Byrne (40), of Levmoss Park, The Gallops, appeared before Dún Laoghaire District Court yesterday.
He was charged with producing a large kitchen knife in the course of a dispute at the address on Wednesday.
The prosecuting garda told Judge Ann Watkin that Byrne made no reply when charged.
He told the court the victim of the alleged incident was Byrne's wife and that she had been stabbed three times, including in the chest.
Byrne applied for bail through his solicitor, but this was objected to by the prosecuting garda.
"The injured party is his wife and she is in hospital as a result of the incident," the officer said.
Judge Watkin said the charge was very serious and denied Byrne bail.
He was remanded in custody to appear before Cloverhill court next Friday.
Plaster
Byrne, who had a plaster over his left eye and was wearing a blue jumper and light grey tracksuit bottoms, sat quietly during the hearing.
Gardaí and an ambulance were called to the scene in the Levmoss estate at lunchtime on Wednesday after reports of a dispute.
The alleged victim was taken to St Vincent's Hospital to be treated for non-life threatening injuries.
Gardaí sealed off the scene for a forensic examination.

The Australian actress (40) said in an Instagram video she had failed to treat her body with "love and respect" in the past.
The Pitch Perfect star - who earlier this year set herself a target of reaching a weight of 75kg - said she was developing "self love".
"I wasn't valuing myself and telling myself negative things. That was hard," she told her followers.
"I'm trying to change those patterns, so you're more loving and treating yourself with respect.
"I'm working on self love, and that's a hard concept to master."
In the video, Wilson said she was motivated to improve her diet by the desire to freeze her eggs in case she wanted to start a family in the future.
"I was thinking about fertility and having good quality eggs in the bank, so I was like, 'OK, I'm going to do this. I'm going to get healthy'.
Detox
"I did go to a professional place to do a detox," she said.
The actress credited Austria's VivaMayr wellness centre with leading her to change her diet and start exercising more.
"I wrote a little letter to myself about how I'm really gonna give it my all this year, and then I did."
Wilson also revealed she has been consuming under 1,500 calories a day while exercising "like a beast".
"Nutritionally, the only thing is I do try to stay under 1,500 calories because of my body type. If want to lose weight in that week, I kind of have to stay under the 1,500 each day."

It came as Det Yates gets closer to rattling the seemingly unshakeable Ger.
Last night saw her hold her nerve when asked about her dealings with the McMorrows and the Dolus Eco Cleaning company.
The bad blood between the pair has been bubbling in recent weeks, and last week saw Det Yates hold his own investigation into Ger and her shady money lending business.
On Tuesday night, viewers were left thinking Ger was on thin ice after she threatened to "smash his pathetic career into the ground".
Caught in the middle, Ger's daughter Hayley admitted to her ex, Det Yates, that she knew what he was up to and that her mother knew too.
In last night's Fair City, Ger made allegations against Det Yates to Det McCabe.
Frozen
When Det Yates told Ger her accounts were frozen, Hayley began to worry for his safety after her mother vowed to put a stop to him.
In a bid to try to warn her ex-boyfriend Steve, Hayley left a concerned voice message for Det Yates.
Ger then made a visit to the garda station and made an accusation against the detective.
As Ger was convinced that she had planted a seed of doubt in the mind of Det McCabe about Det Yates, she failed to mention it to Hayley, who was still torn between the two, warning Steve not to push Ger.
"You push her too far, you'll regret it," Hayley said.
Det Yates then finally found out about Ger's accusation and confronted her in a showdown in the Hungry Pig, telling her she will not get away with it
"You tried to take me down, so it's fair game," he warned.
Hayley, who was hurt after showing loyalty to her mother, accused her of being "the crooked one" and told her she is ashamed to have her as her mother.
•	Fair City is on RTÉ One tonight at 8pm.

Does speed mean less safety? - Debunking myths about vaccines

With the rollout expected to start there next week, attention has turned to disinformation about the vaccine process.
Within hours of the news, both 'Thalidomide' and 'Bill Gates' began trending on Twitter. Both related to widely-circulated but false claims from opponents of vaccination. Here, we debunk some of the myths surrounding the vaccine.
MYTH: The speed with which the vaccine was created means it's not clear if it's safe.
FACT: Most vaccines usually take several years to be developed. However, as England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained, this is usually because they are produced by companies that make an "investment decision about whether to move on" at each stage.
"But with Covid vaccines it's clear we have a global public health emergency on our hands, and even waiting five years for a vaccine if we don't have to is completely the wrong thing to do."
Mr Van-Tam said this meant governments have invested hundreds of millions "to try and speed it up".
The standards for safety and effectiveness have not changed due to the speed of production and testing - and it is still subject to independent regulation.
In the UK's case, this comes from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which approved the Pfizer vaccine yesterday.
MYTH: Didn't the regulators cut corners to test the vaccine quickly?
FACT: No. Part of the reason the MHRA was able to test the vaccine faster than usual is because clinical trials overlapped rather than happening one by one at the end of the process.
This work enabled more than 1,000 pages of data to be examined in tandem with the progress of scientists, meaning the work could be completed far more quickly. The safety checks, however, were still the same.
Additionally, most adverse side-effects to a vaccine occur shortly after receiving it, rather than after many months.
MYTH: The Oxford vaccine contains parts of aborted foetus.
FACT: A Facebook user falsely claimed a separate vaccine developed at Oxford uses MRC-5 cell lines, which were "originally developed from research deriving lung tissue of a 14-week-old aborted Caucasian male foetus".
AstraZeneca has confirmed its vaccine was not developed using MRC-5 cell lines, but does use a different cell strain, taken from a female foetus aborted in the 1970s.
The cells are used to propagate the virus for the vaccine, but these cells do not make it into the final jab.
MRC-5 cells are not the same cells from an aborted foetus. They are cell lines that have been grown in a laboratory from a primary cell culture originally taken from a foetus.
MYTH: Vaccines alter your DNA.
FACT: No they do not. They comprise mRNA that gives the body instructions on how to make proteins on the surface of the virus.
MYTH: Dr Elisa Granato, one of the first participants in the Oxford vaccine trial, has died.
FACT: Dr Granato was one of the first participants in human trials of the AstraZeneca and Oxford University vaccine, and is very much alive.
The false claims of her death prompted her to tweet that she was "having a cup of tea".
MYTH: Bill Gates is using the vaccine to secretly microchip the world
FACT: Gates is regularly the subject of conspiracy theories due to his charity's work in vaccine development.
However, there is no evidence that the Microsoft founder is trying to implant microchips in anyone through vaccines.
Mr Gates has also repeatedly denied these claims.
MYTH: The Covid vaccine is another repetition of the Thalidomide scandal.
FACT: Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early '60s and later caused birth defects.
This has understandably prompted distrust in Government guidance on public health issues.
However, Thalidomide is not comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream, whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the virus.
Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the monitoring system as the Covid-19 vaccine has done.
EveryDoctor, a campaigning organisation run by doctors, tweeted: "There is little reason to suggest the Pfizer Covid vaccine approval by the MHRA is anything but robust."

House prices to rise as pandemic enables buyers to save money

While some households have suffered greatly from the financial impact of Covid, the shutdown in spending means that others have been able to save more than ever, a new survey suggests.
It comes on the tails of record mortgage approvals for October, driven by first-time buyers seeking homes.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin admitted that the potential impact on the housing market would have to be assessed.
"Covid has created a situation which will ultimately have an impact on housing," Mr Martin told the Dáil.
"There has been an enormous increase in household savings throughout the country because of the impact of the crisis on spending in the economy during the past nine months.
"That is being evaluated in terms of its potential impacts on the market over the coming year."
House hunters already face the challenge of a lack of supply which has been exacerbated by construction work slowing down or stopping altogether during lockdown.
Property website MyHome.ie has suggested that 58pc of prospective homebuyers have been able to save more money for a deposit since the emergence of the virus in March.
Meanwhile, 41pc of respondents to the survey agreed that the home-buying market is more competitive now than it was before Covid-19 emerged.
Despite the pandemic's impact on the economy overall, a mere 22pc believe that property prices will fall by more than 5pc in the coming year.
Insulated
"These survey findings show us that prospective homebuyers are still largely insulated from the economic effect of Covid-19, but the virus has still had a significant effect on the sector ," said Angela Keegan, managing director of MyHome.ie.
"Once the economy gets back up and running we will hopefully see an increase in construction activity which would redress the balance between supply and demand."
Speaking yesterday in the Dáil, Mr Martin said that "the bottom line is that the output in 2020 will be approximately 18,000 houses, if we get there".
This is below the target of 25,000, which remains the aim for 2021.
"There is no huge private sector out there at the moment in terms of house construction," Mr Martin said.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the Help to Buy scheme is inflationary.
"It transfers taxpayers' money directly into the pockets of developers and increases property prices," she said.
Quoting figures from the Banking and Payments Federation, she said the data pointed to a very worrying spike in house prices.
"On average, first-time buyers are now borrowing €10,000 more than was the case last year," she said.
"It is worse for other borrowers, who are borrowing €15,000, on average, more than was the case last year.
"This reflects a very serious hike in house prices, which is a problem at any time but is outrageous in the middle of a pandemic when the incomes of so many people have collapsed."

Ireland waiting on EU approval before rollout as UK able to strike its own deal with drug companies

The Republic will have to wait for several more weeks yet.
It follows the decision by the UK's medicines watchdog, the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), to grant the two-dose vaccine emergency approval.
How did the UK manage to be first in the world to approve the vaccine?
The UK withdrew from the EU on January 31 this year so it cut its own deals with the drug companies making potential vaccines.
Negotiates
The MHRA carried out an assessment of the Pfizer vaccine. Ireland and other EU states are waiting for approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Its decision will affect all member states.
As a member of the EU, Ireland has signed up to the Commission-wide system, where it negotiates with drug firms for millions of doses of each vaccine on behalf of all member states.
In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is carrying out its assessment.
What has the MHRA found?
It is independent, so it has to be satisfied that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective. The company said it is 95pc effective against Covid-19.
The regulator would have had access to a lot of data which has not yet been published.
It must have been satisfied that it had enough evidence to give a decision.
It employs around 1,200 people and its head is Dr June Raine, who has a long track record in the regulation of medicines.
It said yesterday that "no corners have been cut" and its assessment was robust.
When is the European Medicines Agency likely to give its verdict on the vaccine?
It wants to take longer and see more data. It is to convene a meeting by December 29, but it could happen before that.
It will then be decided if there is enough data about the vaccine for it to be approved.
It is also assessing the Moderna vaccine and a decision relating to that jab is due in early January.
How many doses of the Pfizer vaccine is the EU getting?
It has signed up for 300 million doses. Ireland will get around 1pc, approximately three million. As with the UK, the supply will only come over many months.
Is it likely other vaccines will also come on stream?
Yes, there are high hopes for other potential vaccines.
The EU has a deal with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Janssen and CureVac.
The Cabinet here has given approval to enter into an advance purchase agreement for five of the potential vaccines and is expected to give the green light to all six if they are approved.
Was Ireland right to join up with the EU scheme?
It's very much to Ireland's benefit to be part of the deal.
The same price is charged to all member states and Ireland is guaranteed to receive its quota of vaccines over the next year.
Will the MHRA equivalent in Ireland, the HPRA, play a role?
The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) said Covid-19 vaccines must first be authorised in line with regulations before they can be made available on the market.
For this to happen, the vaccine developers need to submit an application with comprehensive supporting clinical data to the regulatory authorities.
Expertise
For Covid-19, it is expected the applications for vaccines will be made to the EMA and, if approved, they can be used in all member states.
The EMA relies on scientific expertise from all the national regulatory agencies, including from the HPRA in Ireland.
"The HPRA will be an active participant in the review of Covid-19 vaccine applications," a spokesperson said.
"Our role, working with the EMA, is to carry out a thorough assessment of the supporting data to reach a scientific opinion on whether the vaccine is safe and of suitable quality.
"When the vaccine is in use the HPRA will monitor the safety profile by reviewing all reports of 'suspected adverse events' it receives."

Packaging for vaccine could delay nursing home rollout

Although they are a high priority group, the vaccine must be kept in batches of 975, which could mean wastage if sent to facilities with only 50 residents.
The difficulty posed by this emerged in the UK's plan for the roll-out of the vaccine from next week after it became the first country to licence the jab.
The go-ahead was given after its independent regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said it had assessed the vaccine data with "meticulous care" and deemed it safe and effective.
Regulators will be asked if it is possible to break down the vaccine, which has to be held at freezing temperatures of minus 70C, into smaller batches to allow for distribution to nursing homes and other facilities.
Around three million doses are due for the Republic spread out over many months.
Northern Ireland is to get around 25,000 doses, enough to immunise around 12,000 people and the aim is to begin to roll it out next week.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Republic is waiting for approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is likely to come before the end of the month.
The logistics around getting the vaccine to nursing home residents is expected to be set out in the action plan being finalised by a task force which will report to the Taoiseach at the end of next week.
Ireland is hoping to get acc- ess to several potential vaccines over the coming months at a cost of around €117.6m.
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly indicated they will be distributed free of charge, beginning with the most vulnerable who are due to include healthcare workers.
Trucks
Mr Martin said yesterday that nine ultra-low refrigeration trucks have been imported for the vaccine roll-out.
They arrived on Tuesday and are currently parked at Citywest in Dublin.
They will be operational from next week and can be used to ferry the vital Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to regional locations from a central depot.
It is expected Ireland will set up some form of hub to administer the vaccine, which has to be taken in two doses.
Once the vaccines arrive in hubs, they can be stored at between 2C and 8C for up to five days.
They can also be kept in Pfizer shipping boxes for 30 days.
In response to the UK decision, the EMA said its longer approval procedure was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and checks than the emergency procedure chosen by the UK.
It said it will decide by Dec- ember 29 whether to provisionally authorise the vaccine for use in the EU.
The UK's immunisation advisory committee said that a "precautionary" approach should be taken in advising that pregnant women should not get the vaccine because there is "no data as yet on the safety of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnancy".
"Women should be advised not to come forward to get the vaccination if they may be pregnant or are planning a pregnancy within three months of the first dose," the committee said.
Meanwhile, only very specific high-risk children should be offered the vaccine.
"Following infection, almost all children will have asymptomatic infection or mild disease," the committee said.
Vulnerable
"There are very limited data covering vaccination in adol- escents, with no data on vaccination in younger children, at this time.2
Professor Wei Shen Lim, a respiratory physician, told a London briefing that those in the oldest age groups would be vaccinated first.
He said that in the first phase of the vaccine programme 99pc of the most clinically vulnerable would be covered.
"Prioritisation was based on the risk of dying from Covid-19," Prof Kim said.
"In order to protect the most vulnerable, we have prioritised the most vulnerable individuals first."

Russell in a spin as TV trial brings up painful memories

The classical music star, who has survived two pituitary tumours, said he became "panicky" upon being strapped to the rotating machine, which repeatedly dunked him into cold gunge as he attempted to correctly answer trivia questions.
Despite his claustrophobia, the 54-year-old, who was eliminated from the ITV show on Tuesday, managed to steel himself and complete the challenge.
Petrified
"I would have liked to have done a couple more trials, but the one I did do was enough to last me a lifetime," he said.
"I was petrified as well because I am quite claustrophobic and it reminded me a little bit of the MRI scanner that I have been in, so I was a bit panicky.
"When they were strapping me in I was lying there thinking, 'I don't want to do this'.
"But I got to the point where I said, 'no, we are in here now so I might as well go for it'."
In 2005 Watson began having headaches and was diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma the size of two golf balls. He underwent a five-hour operation to have it removed.
Two years later he became incapacitated while recording his album Outside In and doctors found another growth, which was successfully removed.
The singer, who departed the show in a double eviction alongside soap star Jessica Plummer, said he had turned down the chance to appear on the programme six times because he feared he would not be able to keep up his complex medication regime.
"I didn't think it was something I would be able to do with my daily regime of drugs and steroids that I have to take after the tumour.
Pants
"One of the tablets is hydrocortisone - basically if I didn't take that for 48 hours I would be dead in a coma.
"But when I got there I started thinking, 'I can do this and I can get on with my life'."
Watson said he lost more than 9kg in the two weeks he spent in Gwrych Castle in Wales due to their restricted diet.
"I came out and I had lost nearly 20 pounds in two weeks," he said. "I put my pants on this morning because I thought I might smarten myself up and wear a nice suit today.
"I put my pants on and they literally fell down to the floor. I had to put two belts on just to hold my jeans up."
